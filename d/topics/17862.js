Many patients can even achieve sustained remission. The therapeutic approach has certain general principles, but it is highly individualized for each patient. It depends upon the age of the patient, the severity of the disease, particularly dictated by respiratory or bulbar involvement, and the pace of progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the general treatment of MG. Detailed reviews of chronic immunomodulating therapies for MG and thymectomy for MG are found separately. Myasthenic crisis and the treatment of ocular MG and MG in pregnancy are also discussed in greater detail separately.

These medications are all that is ever needed for some patients. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pyridostigmine</a> bromide (Mestinon) is the main cholinesterase inhibitor currently in use. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>However, most patients with MG require some form of immunotherapy at some point in their illness, if not indefinitely. Even when immunotherapeutic drugs are used, it is common to continue the use of anticholinesterase medications in order to reduce the dosage of immunosuppressive drugs and therefore minimize their adverse effects. Balancing the improvement of MG symptoms with the side effects of the immunotherapeutic agents is always a challenge for the clinician and patient.</p><p>Commonly used immunotherapeutic drugs in MG are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil. In some circumstances, particularly in those with refractory MG, other agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, periodic intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), monthly pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> may be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-immunomodulating-therapies-for-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic immunomodulating therapies for myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Plasmapheresis and IVIG are rapid immunotherapies that work quickly but have a short duration of action. These are usually reserved for certain situations, such as myasthenic crisis, preoperatively before thymectomy, as a &quot;bridge&quot; while initiating slower acting immunotherapies, or as an adjuvant to other immunotherapeutic medications in patients with refractory MG. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Rapid immunotherapies'</a> below.)</p><p>Thymectomy is beneficial for patients with nonthymomatous, generalized acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-associated MG. However, it generally takes months to years for the benefits of thymectomy to accrue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thymectomy for myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The time of onset of clinical effect of each of these therapies for MG varies considerably (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70721\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70721 \">table 1</a>). This plays a large role, in addition to the pace and severity of the disease, in choosing the appropriate therapy for a given patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial therapy for most patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) is an oral anticholinesterase (ie, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) medication, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a> bromide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors retard the degradation of acetylcholine (ACh) that occurs by enzymatic hydrolysis in the neuromuscular junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As a result, the effect of ACh is prolonged, leading to a variable improvement in strength.</p><p>Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide marked improvement in some patients and little or none in others. Often the symptom improvement may be mixed; as an example, there may be resolution of neck weakness and ptosis with persistence of diplopia. In general, limb and bulbar symptoms (dysphagia, fatigable chewing, and dysarthria) respond better to anticholinesterase drugs than the ocular manifestations (ptosis and diplopia). Diplopia is particularly resistant to these medications in many patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the first line of treatment due to their safety and ease of use. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pyridostigmine</a> (Mestinon) is the usual choice. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Neostigmine</a> is available but not commonly used. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide only symptomatic therapy and are usually not sufficient in generalized MG. Nonetheless, in some patients this is the only therapy ever needed for good control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pyridostigmine dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pyridostigmine</a> has a rapid onset of action (15 to 30 minutes) with peak action at about two hours, and its effects last for three to four hours, sometimes longer. Despite its short duration of action, some patients can use it quite effectively with doses every six hours or three times a day. Others need a dose every three hours to maintain symptomatic benefit.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adults and older adolescents, a common starting dose is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a> 30 mg three times a day. The dose is then titrated by its effect. The maximal dose and frequency is usually 120 mg every four hours while awake. An occasional patient will need to take a dose every three hours, but never at shorter intervals. Almost all adult patients require a total daily dose of &le;960 mg, divided into four to eight doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children and younger adolescents, the initial dose is 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every four to six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], up to a total daily dose of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>.</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pyridostigmine</a> is available as scored 60 mg tablets and as a liquid formulation. Pyridostigmine is also available in an intravenous preparation and can be given in patients who cannot take oral drugs. This is usually in the setting of myasthenic crisis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myasthenic-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myasthenic crisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It should be kept in mind that no fixed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a> dosing schedule fits all patients. Most adult patients who respond do so in the range of 60 to 90 mg every four to six hours while awake. Some adults require as much as 120 mg every three to four hours while awake. Doses above this are rarely beneficial and are usually limited by the bothersome cholinergic side effects (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below). When a patient has significant persistent weakness despite the use of pyridostigmine in sufficient doses, or the side effects preclude effective dosing, then immunotherapy is generally warranted.</p><p>The dose regimen used must be thoughtfully individualized to get symptomatic benefits and to limit unnecessary cholinergic side effects. As an example, many patients only have significant symptoms in the evening. An adult patient might do well with no <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a> until a lunchtime dose of 60 mg followed four hours and eight hours later by 90 mg. Those who have trouble chewing or mild dysphagia might benefit by taking a dose 30 minutes before a meal. There are numerous combinations that work best for an individual patient, based upon the severity of symptoms, the response to pyridostigmine, and toleration of side effects. Medications that alleviate some of the cholinergic side effects of pyridostigmine may also be helpful (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Alleviating side effects'</a> below).</p><p>A long-acting formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a> (Mestinon TS, 180 mg) is also available. It is used as a bedtime dose in patients with persistent, severe weakness upon awakening. Most patients, however, do better after a night's sleep, and those with mild weakness upon awakening may do as well by taking a standard pyridostigmine dose at that time. Long-acting pyridostigmine is not a good choice for daytime use because its variable release and delayed absorption make it difficult to provide a consistent effect and to regulate the overall pyridostigmine dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a> are mostly due to the cholinergic properties of the drug. These cholinergic effects can be dose-limiting in many patients. The most bothersome muscarinic side effects include abdominal cramping and diarrhea. Others are increased salivation and bronchial secretions, nausea, sweating, and bradycardia. Nicotinic side effects are also frequent and include fasciculations and muscle cramping. However, these are usually less bothersome than the gastrointestinal effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Alleviating side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a> with food can help to reduce bothersome gastrointestinal side effects. Muscarinic side effects can be controlled in many patients with the use of anticholinergic drugs that have little or no effect at the nicotinic receptors (ie, do not produce increased weakness). These include the following agents:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Glycopyrrolate</a> 1 mg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propantheline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propantheline</a> 15 mg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyoscyamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hyoscyamine</a> sulfate 0.125 mg</p><p/><p>These anticholinergic drugs can be taken prophylactically three times a day or, alternatively, with each <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a> dose.</p><p>Prominent diarrhea can be reduced by the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> (Imodium) or diphenoxylate hydrochloride-atropine sulfate (Lomotil) with or without other anticholinergic drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholinergic crisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A potential major side effect of excessive anticholinesterase medication is weakness, which can be difficult to distinguish from worsening MG. This paradoxical weakening with anticholinesterase medications is called &quot;cholinergic crisis.&quot; However, cholinergic crisis is rarely if ever seen with dose limitation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a> to &le;120 mg every three hours, or a total daily dose of &le;960 mg. Cholinergic crisis is so rare that it should not be the presumed cause of increasing weakness unless the doses taken are known to significantly exceed this range. Otherwise, even in the presence of cholinergic side effects, it should be assumed that the patient's underlying MG is worsening and appropriate treatment should be initiated.</p><p>Some have advocated the use of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a> (Tensilon) test to determine if there is too much or too little anticholinesterase effect in this setting, but this has not proved to be reliable and is not recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Edrophonium test'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC IMMUNOTHERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second therapeutic modality in myasthenia gravis (MG) is the administration of immunomodulating agents. Glucocorticoids are widely used as well as other agents, most commonly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. The onset of action varies considerably, and this plays a role in the choice of therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70721\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70721 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The administration of moderate or high doses of glucocorticoids leads to remission in about 30 percent of patients and marked improvement in another 50 percent. The onset of benefit generally begins within two to three weeks. However, a transient deterioration occurs in up to 50 percent of patients with MG when high-dose glucocorticoids are started, usually occurring 5 to 10 days after the initiation and lasting around five or six days. For this reason, glucocorticoids are started in high doses <strong>only</strong> in hospitalized patients who are receiving concurrent plasmapheresis or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) for myasthenic crisis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myasthenic-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myasthenic crisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To avoid the transient worsening, an outpatient glucocorticoid dose escalation regimen works quite effectively.</p><p>A detailed discussion of glucocorticoids and other immunomodulating agents for MG as well as the data supporting their use is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-immunomodulating-therapies-for-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic immunomodulating therapies for myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RAPID IMMUNOTHERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rapid therapies used in myasthenia gravis (MG) are also immunomodulating but are distinct because of their quick onset, transient benefit, and their use in select situations. Both plasmapheresis and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) start to work quickly (over days), but the benefits are only short term (weeks). These therapeutic modalities are used most often in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myasthenic crisis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myasthenic-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myasthenic crisis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperatively before thymectomy or other surgery (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thymectomy for myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a &quot;bridge&quot; to slower acting immunotherapies (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Bridge therapy'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periodically to maintain remission in patients with MG that is not well controlled despite the use of chronic immunomodulating drugs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasmapheresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) directly removes acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies from the circulation. Clinical improvement with plasmapheresis roughly correlates with the reduction in antibody levels, as illustrated by the following reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In five patients with refractory MG (moderate to severe disability despite treatment with thymectomy, high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, and cholinesterase inhibitors), plasmapheresis combined with prednisone and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> therapy produced clinical improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Serial determinations of serum AChR antibody titers showed a decline to a mean of 21 percent of the baseline levels concurrently with improved strength. Clinically improved patients maintained lowered AChR titers, whereas clinical relapses were associated with a rebound in AChR titers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In seven patients with acquired MG who had elevated serum AChR antibody titers, improvement of muscle strength correlated with reduction of anti-AChR antibody titers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There was a minimum time lag of two days for the clinical response to plasmapheresis.</p><p/><p>The beneficial clinical effect of plasmapheresis is usually seen within days, but the benefit typically lasts only three to six weeks. In addition, the AChR antibody levels rebound within weeks if no concurrent immunotherapy (eg, glucocorticoids) is used.</p><p>Plasmapheresis is an established treatment for seriously ill patients in the midst of myasthenic crisis. The evidence supporting its use in this situation is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myasthenic-crisis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myasthenic crisis&quot;, section on 'Plasma exchange'</a>.)</p><p>Plasmapheresis is not a useful long-term treatment, since the need for repeated exchanges often leads to problems with venous access (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below).</p><p>A potential innovation, not widely adapted, is the use of plasmapheresis with an immunosorbent column consisting of staphylococcal protein A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This technique more efficiently removes IgG, the immunoglobulin that includes those against acetylcholine receptors in MG.</p><p>In a further refinement, a Japanese group has designed an acetylcholine receptor antibody-specific immunosorbent column using a peptide isolated from the acetylcholine receptor of Torpedo Californica, called Medisorba MG. This column is targeted to remove the blocking acetylcholine receptor antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This technique is approved for use in Japan where it has produced clinical improvement in 78 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Its potential advantages include selective removal of anti-AChR antibodies without removing other useful immunoglobulins from the plasma and no requirement for albumin replacement. However, it has limited clinical use and has not yet been shown to be superior to plasmapheresis with regard to efficacy, cost, and safety.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Course of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A typical course of treatment consists of five exchanges (3 to 5 L of plasma each) over 7 to 14 days. The replacement fluid is albumin when used in the treatment of MG. Although done daily in some circumstances, exchanges done every other day are probably more effective in reducing the antibody levels due to the time it takes for the extravascular immunoglobulin to re-equilibrate after each plasma exchange. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Indications and technology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repeated plasmapheresis invariably leads to inadequate peripheral venous access and then requires placement of a large bore, double lumen central catheter (subclavian or internal jugular). Significant chronic catheter complications can result, such as infection and thrombosis. In addition to the catheter complications, plasmapheresis can also produce other adverse effects including bleeding, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps, and a toxic reaction to the citrate used in the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In an analysis of 42 patients with moderate-to-severe MG who were treated with plasmapheresis in a prospective trial, there were no complications in 55 percent and mild-to-moderate complications that did not require stopping treatment in 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The adverse events in this study were mainly citrate reactions and peripheral vascular access problems that were easily managed.

The mechanism of action for IVIG in MG is uncertain. As with plasmapheresis, the effect of IVIG is seen typically in less than a week, and the benefit can last for three to six weeks.

Treatment choices depend on the age of the patient, the severity of the disease, particularly the presence of bulbar or respiratory symptoms, and the pace of progression.</p><p>In addition, special circumstances can dictate different approaches to treat MG. This section will review the approach in adults with generalized MG and ocular MG, adults over 60 years of age, and children. The treatment of MG in pregnancy and approach to severe MG exacerbations including myasthenic crisis is mentioned below but is discussed in greater detail separately.

Those with severe disease, or rapidly worsening disease, should be treated much like those in myasthenic crisis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myasthenic-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myasthenic crisis&quot;</a>) using rapid therapies (ie, intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis) followed by longer-acting immunotherapies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-immunomodulating-therapies-for-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic immunomodulating therapies for myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>) such as glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>.</p><p>When starting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a> for an older adolescent or adult, we begin at 30 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/2</span> tab) with meals three times a day for two to three days to assess the cholinergic side effects (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pyridostigmine dosing'</a> above). For those with excessive cholinergic side effects we add an agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> 1 mg with each pyridostigmine dose) to block those bothersome symptoms. For those who tolerate the pyridostigmine well, with or without anticholinergics, we increase the dose by 30 mg increments until we get to a good therapeutic effect or are limited by side effects. The maximum dose is usually 120 mg every four hours while awake. An occasional patient may need to take it every three hours while awake. For those with bothersome symptoms upon awakening in the morning, we use a long-acting form of pyridostigmine (Mestinon TS 180 mg) at bedtime.</p><p>For children and younger adolescents, the initial dose is 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every four to six hours (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pyridostigmine dosing'</a> above). This can be titrated up slowly based on the therapeutic response and side-effects. The maximal daily dose is 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per 24 hours divided in five to six doses.</p><p>For those patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a> alone whose symptoms are under good control or in remission, we simply follow their clinical course. Thymectomy should be considered in all adult patients under age 60 as well (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thymectomy for myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>). Although there are some patients who do well long-term on pyridostigmine alone, most patients with generalized MG ultimately require some form of immunotherapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-immunomodulating-therapies-for-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic immunomodulating therapies for myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Addition of immunomodulating agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An immunotherapeutic agent is usually required for patients who remain significantly symptomatic on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a>, or who become symptomatic again after a temporary response to pyridostigmine. The choice of agent (most often <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>) depends on many factors. These include the relative contraindications to glucocorticoids (such as diabetes or advanced age), liver disease (precluding azathioprine use), renal disease (precludes cyclosporine use), or leukopenia (problematic for both azathioprine and mycophenolate). The desired time for response onset also is a factor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70721\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70721 \">table 1</a>), varying from two to three weeks with prednisone to approximately 12 months with azathioprine. Cost is another important consideration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-immunomodulating-therapies-for-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic immunomodulating therapies for myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In young adult patients, particularly those of child-bearing potential, we favor the use of glucocorticoids. We often can get a good response with high doses initially and then maintain that response after a slow taper down to low doses (on the order of 10 mg daily of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>). We also use glucocorticoids in older individuals who need a relatively quick response to immunotherapy and then try to add another agent (most often <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil) to replace the glucocorticoids for the long term.</p><p>There are a number of reasonable approaches to starting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, including daily and alternate day dosing.

Effective glucocorticoid-sparing agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>.

After the glucocorticoids have been tapered, we then try to taper <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a>. Many, but certainly not all, patients can be minimally symptomatic or in remission on one immunotherapy agent alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362131414\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring response to immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The response to immunotherapy should be judged, as it is for symptomatic treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a>, by improvement in the clinical symptoms and neurologic deficits on examination. In general, following the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels as a marker for treatment response in MG is not recommended. Data are limited in the modern era of commercially available AChR antibody levels, but one study of 66 patients with MG found that AChR antibody levels correlated only weakly with clinical changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Antibody levels fell in 92 percent of patients who improved, but also in 63 percent of those who did not improve. Thus, AChR antibody levels were not a good biomarker for improvement in MG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Bridge therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those patients with MG in whom it is especially desirable to avoid glucocorticoids (such as those with poorly controlled diabetes) or for those who are not successfully weaned to lower doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, we often use monthly courses of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) until the more slowly acting immunotherapy takes effect. Monthly plasmapheresis is an alternative to IVIG. However, venous access problems develop with frequent use of plasmapheresis, making it less practical than IVIG for use as a bridge therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60761455\"><span class=\"h3\">Refractory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a small cohort of patients with generalized MG who are refractory to, or are limited by the specific toxicities of, the first-line immunotherapies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>). Some require unacceptably high doses of glucocorticoids despite concurrent use of these agents. In these refractory patients, monthly IVIG or the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> is often beneficial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-immunomodulating-therapies-for-myasthenia-gravis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic immunomodulating therapies for myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Choice of agent'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Need for thymectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In parallel with symptomatic treatment and immunotherapeutic agents for MG, we consider thymectomy because of its potential longer-term benefit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thymectomy for myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with thymoma clearly need surgical treatment. Although the need for thymectomy is less certain in those with nonthymomatous tissue, there is evidence that thymectomy improves clinical outcomes. We advise such patients that the likelihood of medication-free remission is about twice as high with thymectomy than without, and that the likelihood of becoming asymptomatic is about one and a half times as high with thymectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. We also emphasize that the benefit of thymectomy is delayed and accrues over several years postoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thymectomy for myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Efficacy'</a>.)</p><p>We advocate thymectomy as soon as the patient's degree of weakness is sufficiently controlled to permit surgery, if the patient is amenable to that surgery. We also prefer to have patients on relatively low doses of glucocorticoids, if possible, to avoid postoperative problems with wound healing.</p><p>For patients with preoperative bulbar or respiratory symptoms, we try to defer surgery until they are reasonably well controlled. We administer IVIG or perform a series of plasma exchanges one or two weeks before surgery, if these respiratory or bulbar symptoms persist. The exact timing of surgery and what techniques are appropriate are issues not settled.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular myasthenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The elements of treatment for ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) are the same as with generalized MG. However, differences in the symptomatology, disability, and prognosis lead to some differences in the treatment approach for these patients. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocular-myasthenia-gravis#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ocular myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Age 60 and over</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not routinely suggest thymectomy in patients over 60 years of age, unless a thymoma is present.

We use age 60 as a rough rule of thumb, but this is moderated by the patient's overall health, functional age, and the patient's wishes after reviewing the issues with him or her. Despite the reluctance at many centers to perform this surgery on older patients with MG, there is some evidence that patients over age 60 may benefit from the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Other than a tendency to use glucocorticoids more sparingly in this group, the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil does not differ from that detailed above. Due to the potential renal side effects, we do not commonly use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> in these patients. There are few studies that look at the treatments in this particular age group. However, the usefulness of immunotherapy is supported by a study of outcome at one year or longer in 149 patients with disease onset after age 60 who were treated with azathioprine with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

If anticholinesterase medications are not sufficient, plasmapheresis or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> may be used, but the benefits are transient.</p><p>Glucocorticoids are generally limited to severe disease that is unresponsive to these interventions.

Thymectomy is a widely accepted option for peripubertal and postpubertal children with generalized MG who have positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies or who are seronegative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/5,9,10,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,10,34,35</a>].

Thorascopic thymectomy, potentially a more acceptable treatment in this age group, has been used successfully in a small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The likelihood of improvement or remission after a single procedure (thymectomy) compared with long-term immunotherapy makes this option a reasonable consideration in all children who have more than mild disease. No significant deleterious consequences of removing the thymus in childhood have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Similar to adults with MuSK antibody-positive MG (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis#H7669765\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thymectomy for myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'MuSK antibody-positive myasthenia'</a>), children with MuSK-positive MG have not been shown to benefit from thymectomy. Therefore, thymectomy is <strong>not</strong> recommended for this group. The role of thymectomy in prepubertal children remains controversial. This group has a higher incidence of spontaneous remission and is also more likely to be seronegative, making confirmation of the diagnosis more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/9,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,33</a>]. </p><p>The clinical outcome in childhood MG varies with age of onset, race, and sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].
