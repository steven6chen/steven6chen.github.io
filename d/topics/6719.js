In a single center series, acute antibody-mediated rejection was detected in 21 (4 percent) of 501 lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The predilection of neutrophilic infiltration and fibrinoid necrosis of vessels in the alveolar septa illustrates that alveolar capillaries are the primary targets of antibody-mediated injury in hyperacute rejection. It is thought that antibody binding to its specific HLA on endothelial cells activates complement, which ultimately results in endothelial cell lysis. Endothelial cell damage results in exposure of the basement membrane and activation of the coagulation cascade leading to thrombosis and infarction. In addition, complement activation leads to the chemotaxis of neutrophils and macrophages, which propagate the acute lung injury. &#160; </p><p>Complement component deposition (C4d) in the capillary endothelium demonstrates direct immunopathological evidence for the action of antibodies. However, complement deposition is not necessarily specific for AMR. In some reports, deposition of C3d and C4d is present in lung biopsies from patients with infection and primary graft dysfunction without evidence of HLA antibodies, suggesting that this may be a nonspecific finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In addition, the results of the direct crossmatch performed at the time of transplantation are reviewed to determine whether the recipient is sensitized to the specific donor antigens and ultimately whether the transplant is HLA-compatible or not.

The older complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay has largely been replaced by highly sensitive, solid-phase assays that test the potential recipient's serum against beads coated with single or multiple purified HLA antigens. Using this approach, the presence and specificity of any HLA antibodies in the potential recipient's serum can be determined. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) for any HLA antibody that is detected provides a measure of the antibody's avidity to its respective HLA molecule. The results of the HLA antibody assessment are entered into the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database at the time of listing for transplantation.

Again, a variety of methods may be used, including CDC and flow cytometry. In a flow cytometry crossmatch, recipient serum is incubated with donor lymphocytes (T and B cells). After incubation, antibodies bound to the donor cells are tagged with immunofluorescent anti-immunoglobulin-G antibodies, and flow cytometry is used to assess the number of tagged cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Ultimately, the histopathologic findings in acute AMR are usually non-specific and the diagnosis requires a multidisciplinary evaluation including testing for DSA. </p><p>The mechanism for cell injury (capillaritis) in AMR is thought to be antibody recognition via DSA, followed by complement-mediated cytotoxicity, which is supported by the finding of C4d deposition as a prominent feature in antibody-mediated rejection in kidney allografts. However, the relationship between DSA and acute AMR is complex, as DSA can be seen in patients with acute cellular rejection and chronic lung transplant rejection with bronchiolitis obliterans, as well as acute AMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. In a study of lung biopsies obtained for allograft dysfunction, the histopathologic findings of 23 patients who had concurrent DSA were compared with 26 patients who did not have DSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The predominant finding among those with DSA was high-grade acute cellular rejection; 17 of 23 patients had acute cellular rejection (2 with grade A2, 14 with grade A3, and 1 with grade A4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The remaining five patients with DSA had acute and organizing lung injury without capillaritis. Of note, capillaritis was noted only in a minority of cases and was associated with other features of cellular rejection.</p><p>Deposition of immunoglobulins and complement products (particularly Cd4) in the alveolar septum has been reported in patients with HLA antibodies and may be a manifestation of AMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], although this is controversial and lung allograft injury may occur in the absence of complement activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/3,4,27,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,27,33,34</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case series of 22 lung transplant recipients who developed capillaritis, complement deposition was associated with septal capillary necrosis and deposition of complement components and immunoglobulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Furthermore, Cd4 deposition was noted in 6 of the 26 patients who had cellular rejection but no DSA, and the pattern of deposition was similar to those with DSA. In addition, C4d deposition has been an inconsistent finding in some case series of AMR after lung transplantation. In one series of 10 patients with AMR, two of five had C4d deposition in the capillary endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

So, it is unclear if clinically silent AMR exists and what its clinicopathological features would be. </p><p>Development of DSA may be a risk factor for acute AMR. In a series of 441 lung transplant recipients, 139 (32 percent) developed detectable antibodies to HLA; of these, 54 (39 percent) developed antibodies specific to donor HLA, which was associated with poorer survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33847344\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When lung transplant recipients develop respiratory symptoms weeks to months after transplantation, the evaluation requires a combination of tests to determine the cause of allograft dysfunction, such as infection, airway anastomotic complications, acute cellular rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans, cardiac dysfunction, and AMR.

The more common type of acute rejection in lung transplantation, acute cellular rejection, is mediated by T lymphocyte recognition of foreign HLA epitopes. (See <a href=\"#H33845427\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperacute rejection is a recognized syndrome of AMR that occurs in the first minutes to hours after reperfusion of the lung allograft and is caused by pre-existing donor specific antibodies (DSA). Hyperacute rejection is rare, as &quot;virtual crossmatch&quot; of previously identified anti-HLA antibodies with potential donor HLA epitopes prior to transplantation avoids major HLA incompatibility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection#H5081209\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of acute lung transplant rejection&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a> and <a href=\"#H390634500\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperacute rejection is associated with profound hypoxemia, diffuse noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and alveolar hemorrhage. The histopathologic findings attributed to hyperacute AMR include small vessel neutrophilic vasculitis or &quot;capillaritis,&quot; intra-alveolar hemorrhage, and diffuse alveolar damage. (See <a href=\"#H390636348\" class=\"local\">'Pathology and pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H390634431\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hyperacute rejection is based upon the timing of acute allograft dysfunction in a recipient with pre-transplant DSA (recognizing HLA or non-HLA epitopes) and a positive direct cross-match between the recipient's serum and donor cells indicating immunologic incompatibility. Other processes in the differential diagnosis, such as primary graft dysfunction, pulmonary edema from volume overload or myocardial dysfunction, bacterial pneumonia, aspiration, pulmonary thromboembolism, and anastomotic problems must be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H390634438\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H390634445\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal treatment for hyperacute rejection is not known. Due to the severity of respiratory compromise associated with hyperacute AMR, treatment directed at antibody depletion is typically initiated. Most regimens include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, and therapeutic plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). Additional agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a>) may be added if the patient fails to improve. Empiric antibiotics are often administered pending culture results. (See <a href=\"#H390634445\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small number of lung transplant recipients (less than 5 percent) develop acute AMR in the weeks to months following transplantation. Acute AMR is associated with nonspecific symptoms, such as dyspnea, cough, fever, and hemoptysis, that can progress rapidly to respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H33845851\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of potential acute AMR requires a combination of tests to look for evidence of AMR and to exclude alternate diagnoses, such as infection, airway anastomotic problems, acute cellular rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans, cardiac dysfunction, and fluid overload. Testing usually includes laboratory studies for DSA, appropriate blood and sputum tests for infection, assessment of fluid status and cardiac function, chest imaging to clarify location and extent of abnormalities, spirometry, and flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H33847344\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H33845872\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Criteria for the diagnosis of acute AMR after lung transplantation have been established by the International Society for Heart Lung Transplantation (ISHLT): presence of DSA, acute lung injury pattern on histopathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96771\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96771 \">picture 3</a>), sub-endothelial C4d deposition in alveolar capillaries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96772\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96772 \">picture 4</a>), and overt allograft dysfunction, with the exclusion of other potential causes of allograft dysfunction.
