Intermediate or high-level resistance to penicillin has become a significant problem.

An overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of CAP in children and the microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> are discussed separately.

In children, the incidence of pneumococcal carriage may be as high as 60 percent, even after immunization with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-streptococcus-pneumoniae#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and pathogenesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>). Antibiotic-resistant strains are increasingly common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=resistance-of-streptococcus-pneumoniae-to-beta-lactam-antibiotics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=resistance-of-streptococcus-pneumoniae-to-the-fluoroquinolones-doxycycline-and-trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to the fluoroquinolones, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=resistance-of-streptococcus-pneumoniae-to-the-macrolides-azalides-lincosamides-and-ketolides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to the macrolides, azalides, lincosamides, and ketolides&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Invasive disease most commonly occurs upon acquisition of a new serotype, typically after an incubation period of one to three days.</p><p>The incidence of disease increases strongly in association with a viral illness, such as influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, or human metapneumovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. In a case-control study, upper respiratory infections with viruses such as influenza and parainfluenza correlated with acquisition of new serotypes of pneumococci in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This association is believed to be related to increased expression of receptors for pneumococcal attachment on virally activated respiratory epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, viral neuraminidases cleave sialic acid from host cell glycoconjugates, and the resulting free sugar is used as a nutrient to increase the growth and density of pneumococci in the nasopharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This adds another dimension to the synergy between viruses and pneumococci in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.</p><p>Pneumococci are presumably aerosolized from the nasopharynx to the alveolus, where they enter alveolar type II cells. This invasive process involves bacterial binding to the receptor for platelet activating factor (PAF), a key pulmonary chemokine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The binding occurs via choline, a chemical constituent shared between the surface of the bacteria and PAF. Choline is present on the surfaces of many pulmonary pathogens, suggesting a common mechanism for pulmonary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The innate host C-reactive protein binds to choline and opsonizes pathogens that pass from the lungs into the bloodstream. Thus, although choline is useful in the organism's binding to the lung, it is detrimental to the organism in the bloodstream. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-streptococcus-pneumoniae#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and pathogenesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>The pneumonic lesion progresses as pneumococci multiply in the alveolus and invade the alveolar epithelium. Pneumococci pass from alveolus to alveolus through the pores of Cohn, thereby creating inflammation and consolidation strictly along lobar compartments. The center of the spreading lesion shows more advanced inflammation than do the edges.</p><p>The evolution of lung consolidation is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newly involved regions demonstrate engorgement of alveolar capillaries with frothy, serous, blood-tinged fluid in the alveolar spaces. This lesion can be recapitulated by instillation of heat-killed pneumococci into the lung and, therefore, may result from host response to the pneumococcal cell wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Engorgement of alveolar capillaries rapidly progresses to red hepatization, characterized by a dry, granular, dark red lung surface and alveoli filled with copious, clotted inflammatory exudate. A distinctive feature of the exudate is its &quot;freshness&quot; in that erythrocytes and leukocytes are intact, and a fibrin network extends from one alveolus into the next through the pores of Cohn. Pneumococci are intact and alive. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contains large amounts of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, and nitric oxide reflective of strong recruitment of leukocytes to the infected focus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, little tissue destruction or necrosis occurs during this process, perhaps explaining why the patient and lung architecture may recover fully from these lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As red hepatization progresses over two to three days, leukocytes pack into the alveoli, erythrocytes are lysed, and epithelial cells degenerate, leading to grey hepatization. Dying pneumococci release the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin, which contributes to this damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the presence of antibody, pneumococci are opsonized and then phagocytosed by leukocytes and begin to be cleared. Consolidation remains prominent after defervescence. An abrupt disappearance of fever, termed &quot;crisis,&quot; is particularly common in children. Resolution results in a jelly-like consistency to the lung with a slimy, yellowish exudate. The involvement of mononuclear cells in the exudate is characteristic of this stage. Absorption of the exudate is remarkably efficient, with little organization or permanent scarring.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96959883\"><span class=\"h2\">Burden of disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumonia is the single most common disease causing death in children worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be caused by a variety of bacterial and viral pathogens, and the predominant pathogen varies depending on age. Overall, <em>S. pneumoniae</em> is the most common bacterial cause of CAP, although in many cases an organism cannot be isolated.
