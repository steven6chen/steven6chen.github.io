IUAs are commonly treated with hysteroscopic resection followed by mechanical or hormonal treatments. Clinical challenges include primary prevention of adhesions, surgical removal, and prevention of recurrent disease.</p><p>This topic will discuss the management of intrauterine adhesions.

For women with miscarriage or unintended pregnancy, medical therapy may be used rather than surgical management at an early gestational age (up to 70 days of gestation for pregnancy termination). Women with spontaneous abortion also have the option of expectant management. In a trial that randomly assigned 82 women with retained products of conception after spontaneous abortion to observation (expectant management), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, or curettage, only women in the surgical treatment group (2 women, 7.7 percent) had IUAs at the time of hysteroscopy at six months, although the difference was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Limitations include the small number of trial participants and the reality that some women who elect non-invasive management will still require a procedure for retained products of conception or heavy bleeding.</p><p>The following techniques have been associated with reduced postoperative adhesion formation, but long-term data, particularly for pregnancy and live birth rates, are limited.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgical technique</strong> &ndash; A joint review of studies by the AAGL and the European Society of Gynaecological Endoscopy (ESGE) reported that the risk of adhesion formation appears to be reduced with [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Procedures confined to the endometrium compared with those involving the myometrium or opposing surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Procedures using cold loop lesion removal rather than electrocautery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Procedures with less resection compared with greater resection (eg, polypectomy compared with resection of multiple fibroids) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and with hysteroscopic resection rather than blind or ultrasound-guided curettage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, less invasive or cold techniques may be appropriate to treat the underlying pathology (eg, electrosurgery may be necessary for safe removal of a vascular lesion such as leiomyoma).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Semisolid (gel) adhesion barriers</strong> &ndash; The above joint review of studies by the AAGL and the ESGE concluded that use of gel adhesions barriers after surgery that could potentially damage the endometrium reduced the development of IUAs in the short term, but available data on subsequent fertility were lacking. The practice guideline did not indicate whether or not gel barriers should be used as a primary prevention strategy. Since the above AAGL review, additional information has come out in support of gel adhesion barriers for primary prevention of adhesions. For example, in a trial comparing the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> with no treatment for adhesion prevention after suction dilation and curettage for miscarriage, the women treated with gel had a nearly 60 percent reduction in risk of adhesion reformation (IUA reformation in 13 versus nearly 31 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At this time, we do not use gel barriers as prophylaxis against adhesion formation for women undergoing routine uterine procedures. However, for procedures that are at high risk of causing adhesion formation, such as suction curettage for retained products of conception or for hysteroscopic myomectomy of opposing fibroids, we discuss the available data with the patient and perform joint decision making regarding the use of gel barriers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Postoperative measures after resection of IUAs are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3559108897\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of adhesion reformation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1278372302\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF EXPECTANT MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While surgery is considered the standard of care for symptomatic IUAs, there are no data from trials comparing surgery with expectant management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For women with known symptomatic IUAs who do not want or are unable to access hysteroscopic resection, expectant management is a reasonable option. One study reported pregnancy in 45.5 percent of women who elected expectant management when followed for up to seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3754677400\"><span class=\"h1\">HYSTEROSCOPIC RESECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard treatment of symptomatic intrauterine adhesions is lysis under direct hysteroscopic visualization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Blind dilation and curettage or blind cervical probing, common modes of treatment prior to the development of hysteroscopy, are no longer advised because they do not remove abnormal tissue, disease classification is not possible, and indiscriminate curettage may further damage the endometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The goal of surgery is to restore the size and shape of the uterine cavity, as well as endometrial function and fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Lysis of moderate or severe adhesions should be performed by an experienced hysteroscopic surgeon. General principles of hysteroscopy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hysteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hysteroscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cervical dilation and hysteroscope insertion</strong> &ndash; Care must be taken during cervical dilation in women with severe occlusion of the uterine cavity because it is easy to create a false cervical passage and to perforate the uterus. Guidance with pelvic ultrasonography can help define the cervical canal and the junction between the cervical internal os and the intrauterine cavity. Ultrasonography can also be used to guide dissection. A small (5 mm) rigid hysteroscope can be used to pass through the cervical canal and into the uterine cavity under direct visualization to decrease the chance for creation of a false passage. We use a 0- or 12-degree hysteroscope for this dissection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Excision of adhesions</strong> &ndash; The procedure is begun by placing the hysteroscope at the internal os and lysing adhesions with sharp dissection. Adhesive bands are identified through the hysteroscope, and clipped at the junction of the band to the endometrium in order to excise the adhesion (in contrast, uterine septa are managed by incision). We prefer to use small, rigid scissors because scissors avoid the thermal tissue injury that occurs with electrosurgery. Careful dissection is continued until the entire uterine cavity is free of adhesions. The goal is restoration of normal anatomy. Alternatives to scissors include blunt adhesiolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and bipolar electrosurgery, in which the adhesive bands are vaporized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adjunctive interventions</strong> &ndash; For cases that require more extensive dissection, such as when there is agglutination of the walls of the cavity, we suggest concurrent laparoscopy or ultrasound guidance to reduce the risk of uterine perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Alternatively, fluoroscopy can be used in severe cases to guide dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A cohort study of 770 adhesiolysis procedures performed under fluoroscopic guidance reported an 80 percent primary procedure success rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Trials comparing fluoroscopically-guided procedures with ultrasound-guided outcomes have not been performed. While there are no data reporting a lower risk of perforation or improved outcome with adjunctive procedures, the rationale is that the use of such approaches may lessen the impact of perforation should it occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In our practice, we typically utilize ultrasound and find that laparoscopy rarely needs to be performed concomitantly with ultrasound guidance. Avoidance of laparoscopy reduces the surgical risk and speeds recovery from the procedure. However, if perforation is suspected or confirmed when energy is being used for the dissection, then laparoscopy is necessary to exclude an inadvertent bowel injury. If perforation occurs using instruments without energy, expectant management is reasonable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Role of laparotomy</strong> &ndash; If adhesions are so severe that the cavity cannot be entered with the hysteroscope, a laparotomy with hysterotomy is possible, but is rarely performed, and is reserved for severe cases in which no other treatment options are available or possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>Each adhesiolysis procedure is unique and requires a careful understanding of uterine anatomy, and patient, skilled dissection. With a completely obliterated cavity, dissection beginning in the midline and moving laterally under ultrasound guidance may be effective. If there is any area of less dense adhesions that would allow visualization of normal anatomic structures (such as the uterine cornua), dissection should begin in this area. Identification of the tubal ostia, either prior to or during the lysis procedure, can provide useful markers of the lateral and fundal cavity edges, and can be used to guide the degree of tissue removal. Aggressive dissection that might enter the myometrium should be avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3559108897\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF ADHESION REFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of post-lysis management is to reduce the risk of reformation of adhesions and promote regrowth of endometrium. However, optimal postoperative management is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. In a meta-analysis of trials comparing multiple types of anti-adhesion therapies with placebo or no intervention, the authors concluded that &quot;clinical effectiveness of anti-adhesion treatment for improving key reproductive outcomes or for decreasing IUAs following operative hysteroscopy in subfertile women remains uncertain&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the meta-analysis, there was no difference between treatment and no <span class=\"nowrap\">treatment/placebo</span> on live birth rate&nbsp;(odds ratio [OR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.46-2.13, three studies, 150 women), although antiadhesion therapy was associated with fewer recurrent IUAs at the time of second-look hysteroscopy (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20-0.64, seven studies, 528 women). Of note, in women surgically treated for IUAs, adhesion recurrence rates of 30 to 66 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3022266825\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the optimal methods to prevent adhesion reformation are not known, our management is based upon personal experience in addition to the available evidence (mainly observational studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Our preferred approach to prevent formation of new adhesions is to treat the woman with estrogen for 30 days following the initial resection, with 10 days of progestin treatment added on days 21 to 30, and place a pediatric bladder catheter in the intrauterine cavity. For women with severe IUAs at the time of resection, we repeat hysteroscopy following the withdrawal bleed. This approach limits the number of required procedures yet still allows for treatment of any new adhesions while they are filmy and easily removed. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use postoperative estrogen therapy rather than no hormonal therapy. For women with no contraindications to estrogen use, the risks associated with this therapy are low and observational data suggest better outcomes with estrogen therapy than with no postoperative therapy. This can be used in combination with a mechanical barrier. When used, estrogen therapy can be started on the day after the procedure. In our practice, we give 2.5 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjugated-equine-estrogens-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">conjugated equine estrogens</a> or 4 mg estradiol orally, twice daily, for 30 days. On the last 10 days of estrogen therapy we add 10 mg of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> or 2.5 mg of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate to the regimen to stimulate a withdrawal bleed. Choice of estrogen and progestin medications is in part driven by insurance coverage. (See <a href=\"#H3474849718\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use an intrauterine pediatric bladder catheter (ie, pediatric Foley bladder catheter), in addition to estrogen therapy, to provide mechanical separation of the uterine walls during the healing phase. While triangular (eg, Malecot) and procedure-specific catheters are available for this purpose, we prefer a pediatric bladder catheter. The catheter balloon is typically filled with 2 to 3 mL of saline. The catheter is removed after 7 to 10 days of use. With either the bladder or Malecot catheter, we give antibiotics (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> 100 mg twice daily for 10 days) because the catheter is a foreign body in the uterus that is contiguous with the nonsterile vagina. (See <a href=\"#H254016731\" class=\"local\">'Intra-uterine catheter'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with severe IUAs at the time of resection, we perform repeat hysteroscopy in addition to using oral estrogen and an intrauterine catheter. We perform the hysteroscopy shortly (days) after the withdrawal bleed that is induced by the estrogen-progestin treatment. The goal is to remove any newly developed adhesions in women who have already demonstrated the ability to create significant adhesive disease. (See <a href=\"#H3208892942\" class=\"local\">'Repeat hysteroscopy'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2613156467\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment options</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3474849718\"><span class=\"h3\">Estrogen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for postoperative estrogen therapy is that the hormone will promote regrowth of the endometrium over the denuded surface. However, there are no evidence-based recommendations on optimal formulation, dose, or duration, in part because studies that compare different estrogen regimens, in isolation from other therapies for IUA prevention, are lacking. A systematic review of 26 studies reported that estrogen therapy in combination with other therapies (eg, intrauterine device, bladder catheter) appeared to be beneficial, but the range of results was wide and meta-analysis was not performed because of the variations in study designs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A different meta-analysis was unable to make any conclusions regarding postoperative estrogen use because of the treatment combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A third meta-analysis comparing estrogen with placebo for adhesion prevention after septoplasty found no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, the studies included were underpowered as the sample sizes were small and the adhesion formation rate was low among all groups. Lastly, a fourth meta-analysis that assessed the impact of estrogen versus placebo reported there was no difference between the groups in ongoing pregnancy rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. We use estrogen therapy in conjunction with repeat hysteroscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254016731\"><span class=\"h3\">Intra-uterine catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheters (eg, size 8 pediatric bladder catheter with a 5 cc balloon or Malecot catheter) can be inserted into the uterine cavity immediately after adhesion lysis. One study of 110 women who received either a postoperative bladder catheter or IUD after adhesion lysis reported higher rates of normal menses and conception as well as lower reoperation rates for women with catheters compared to women with IUDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Another study of 107 women found the reduction in adhesions at second-look hysteroscopy to be greatest with an intrauterine catheter, followed by an intrauterine device, and then by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> gel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. When a bladder or Malecot catheter is used, the device is removed from the uterus after 7 to 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. When a bladder or Malecot catheter is inserted, the tubing can be trimmed so it does not hang out of the vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3208892942\"><span class=\"h3\">Repeat hysteroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repeat hysteroscopy can assess for adhesion recurrence, and allow for repeat adhesion resection if reformation has occurred. Such second-look hysteroscopy is commonly performed up to three months after initial adhesiolysis, although the use of serial hysteroscopic procedures at shorter time intervals has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25-27</a>].</p><p>The technique for serial hysteroscopy is to repeat office hysteroscopy 7 to 14 days after the initial sharp lysis of adhesions. At this time, filmy adhesions that have reformed are bluntly lysed with the hysteroscope, which prevents development of dense adhesions. Typically two to three postoperative office hysteroscopies are required when using this approach. These office procedures are typically well tolerated by the patients. One small study using this technique had the patient return every one to three weeks to repeat the procedure until no further reformation of adhesions occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The study reported 92 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(22/24)</span> of patients had improvement in the staging of their adhesions, 95 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(18/19)</span> of patients presenting with menstrual flow abnormalities had resumption of normal menses, and 46 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(7/15)</span> of women who desired pregnancy had conceived or delivered at the time the study concluded. Another study in women with severe adhesions randomized one group to repeat hysteroscopy one week later followed by a subsequent third-look hysteroscopy (n = 36) versus second-look hysteroscopy two months after the initial procedure (n = 35) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Both groups received an IUD and estrogen therapy after the initial adhesiolysis. The group that underwent short-interval hysteroscopy had significantly fewer adhesions at the third hysteroscopy compared with the longer-interval group (11 versus 83 percent). Although the pregnancy rates were not significantly different (47 versus 30 percent), there was a trend for higher pregnancy rate in the group with an early repeat hysteroscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3434767352\"><span class=\"h3\">Intrauterine gel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> gel and polyethylene oxide-sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboxymethylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboxymethylcellulose</a> gel have appeared to reduce the reformation of IUAs, but their impact on subsequent pregnancy and live birth rates is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2,19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19,21</a>]. One randomized trial (n = 92) comparing postoperative hyaluronic acid gel with no treatment after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis reported a lower rate of adhesions at three-month second-look hysteroscopy (14 versus 32 percent); no long-term follow-up data regarding menstrual symptoms or fertility were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. While one meta-analysis concluded that gel barriers (hyaluronic acid and polyethylene oxide-sodium carboxymethylcellulose gels) have a role in preventing IUA reformation, a different meta-analysis reported that no definitive conclusion could be made regarding impact because of the heterogeneity of study designs and lack of reproducibility of study results by one research group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-adhesions-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Women with a history of surgery for IUAs are assessed during pregnancy for abnormal placentation.

Minimally traumatic surgical techniques and semisolid (gel) adhesion barriers have been associated with reduced postoperative adhesion formation, but long-term data, particularly for pregnancy and live birth rates, are limited. (See <a href=\"#H2452433331\" class=\"local\">'Primary prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While surgery is considered the standard of care for symptomatic IUAs, there are no trial data comparing surgery with expectant management. For women with known symptomatic IUAs who do not want or are unable to access hysteroscopic resection, expectant management is a reasonable option. (See <a href=\"#H1278372302\" class=\"local\">'Role of expectant management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform hysteroscopic resection of symptomatic adhesions. (See <a href=\"#H3754677400\" class=\"local\">'Hysteroscopic resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As the optimal methods to prevent adhesion reformation are not known, our management is based upon personal experience in addition to the available evidence (mainly observational studies). To prevent the reformation of adhesions after hysteroscopic lysis, we insert a pediatric bladder catheter into the uterine cavity postoperatively and then start the woman on oral estrogen therapy, with timed progestin therapy added to induce a withdrawal bleed. We also perform repeat hysteroscopy for women with severe IUAs noted at the time of resection. (See <a href=\"#H3022266825\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women undergoing hysteroscopic adhesion resection, we suggest postoperative insertion of a catheter into the intrauterine cavity rather than no catheter (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Compared with insertion of an intrauterine device or gel, intrauterine catheters have been associated with higher pregnancy rates and lower rates of adhesion reformation. (See <a href=\"#H254016731\" class=\"local\">'Intra-uterine catheter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women undergoing hysteroscopic adhesion resection, we suggest postoperative estrogen therapy rather than no treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For women with no contraindications to estrogen use, the risks associated with this therapy are low and the body of evidence leans toward better outcomes with estrogen therapy than with no postoperative therapy, although the available data conflict. (See <a href=\"#H3474849718\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women undergoing hysteroscopic resection of severe IUAs, we also suggest repeat hysteroscopy rather than no hysteroscopy or instillation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> gel (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, as the optimal approach to the prevention of IUAs is not yet known, these treatment options are reasonable alternatives. (See <a href=\"#H3208892942\" class=\"local\">'Repeat hysteroscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancies in women with a history of moderate to severe IUAs can be considered high risk and may require a consultation from a maternal fetal medicine specialist. Pregnancy complications can include intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, and abnormal placentation (ie, accreta) (See <a href=\"#H4218746838\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcomes data following resection of IUAs are from small studies and thus wide ranges have been reported. Studies of treated women have reported improved menstrual flow in 80 to 100 percent of women, pregnancy rates of 40 to 80 percent, and live birth rates of 30 to 70 percent. However, recurrence rates of 33 to 66 percent have also been noted.
