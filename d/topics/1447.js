It can also cause wheezing (noisy breathing), coughing, or a tight feeling in the chest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18846644\"><span class=\"h1\">Do asthma symptoms change during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. During pregnancy, a woman's asthma symptoms can get better, worse, or stay the same.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18846651\"><span class=\"h1\">How is asthma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma is treated with different types of medicines. These can be inhalers, liquids, or pills. Asthma medicines work in different ways. They can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop symptoms quickly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control symptoms over time and prevent future symptoms</p><p/><p>Your doctor will work with you to make an asthma action plan. This is a list of instructions that tells you which medicines to take and when to take them. It also tells you when to get help or call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1) for your asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18846658\"><span class=\"h1\">Are asthma medicines safe to take during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Many asthma medicines are safe to take during pregnancy. If your asthma medicines are not safe to take during pregnancy, your doctor will change them.</p><p>It's important to take all the asthma medicines your doctor prescribes so that your asthma is well-controlled. Having asthma that is not well-controlled can lead to serious health problems for you and your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18846665\"><span class=\"h1\">Which doctors and nurses will take care of me during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might need a few different doctors and nurses to take care of you during pregnancy. Usually, 1 doctor will take care of your pregnancy. He or she might also be able to take care of your asthma. If not, you will see another doctor who can take care of your asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18846672\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I have tests during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will probably do a breathing test to check how your lungs are working. He or she might also recommend that you use a &quot;peak flow meter&quot; at home. A peak flow meter is a device that you breathe into that can show how well your lungs are working.</p><p>Your doctor will also do different tests to check your baby's health. These include blood tests and an imaging test called an ultrasound. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18846679\"><span class=\"h1\">What else can I do to prevent asthma symptoms during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help prevent asthma symptoms, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid your asthma triggers &ndash; Triggers are things that cause asthma symptoms or make symptoms worse. Common triggers are dust, mold, dogs, cats, pollen, plants, and cigarette smoke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking, and avoid being near people who smoke</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get a flu shot &ndash; A flu shot can help keep you from getting the flu. Getting the flu can cause asthma symptoms to get worse.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18846686\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my baby be healthy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your asthma is well-controlled during pregnancy, chances are good that it will not hurt your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18846693\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I breastfeed if I have asthma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have asthma, it can be especially healthy to breastfeed your baby. That's because babies who breastfeed have a lower chance of having episodes of wheezing during their first 2 years.</p><p>If you plan to breastfeed your baby, let your doctor or nurse know. He or she will make sure that your asthma medicines are safe to take if you breastfeed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18846700\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-metered-dose-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your metered dose inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-dry-powder-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your dry powder inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-asthma-triggers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Avoiding asthma triggers (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for asthma (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
