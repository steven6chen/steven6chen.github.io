HL has a unique cellular composition, containing a minority of neoplastic cells (Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants) in an inflammatory background. It is separated from the other B cell lymphomas based on its unique clinicopathologic features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathologic features, and diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus, which is spread mainly through saliva between susceptible persons and asymptomatic EBV shedders. The majority of primary EBV infections throughout the world are subclinical. Antibodies to EBV have been demonstrated in all population groups with a worldwide distribution; approximately 90 to 95 percent of adults are EBV-seropositive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-epstein-barr-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of Epstein-Barr virus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathobiology of HL remains poorly understood. The role of EBV infection in the development of HL will be reviewed here. Further details on the pathogenesis of HL are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The Reed-Sternberg cell and the pathogenesis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS SUGGESTING AN ASSOCIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early epidemiologic data suggested that HL develops among persons with a delayed exposure to a ubiquitous infectious agent, EBV. The following sections will review data suggesting an association between EBV and HL. Mechanisms thought to be involved in the development of EBV-negative HL are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The Reed-Sternberg cell and the pathogenesis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with infectious mononucleosis and EBV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial epidemiologic studies that demonstrated an increased risk of HL in patients with a history of infectious mononucleosis were further substantiated by case control studies showing that patients with HL had elevated antibody titers against EBV antigens, which preceded the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Subsequent studies showed that EBV could be detected in the tumor cells of a subset of patients with HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. Finally, in a population-based cohort study of young adults with infectious mononucleosis in Denmark and Sweden, the risk of developing EBV-negative HL after infectious mononucleosis was not increased (relative risk 1.5, 95% CI 0.9-2.5), whereas the risk of developing EBV-positive HL was increased (relative risk 4.0, 95% CI 3.4-4.5), with a median incubation time from mononucleosis to EBV-positive HL of 4.1 years (95% CI 1.8-8.3 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this population, the absolute risk of developing HL after infectious mononucleosis was approximately 1 in 1000.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunosuppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increased incidence of HL is observed in immunosuppressed populations, including iatrogenic immune deficiency following solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation or the treatment of autoimmune disease, and HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. HL in these populations is almost universally EBV-associated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], and the HL is usually of the mixed cellularity subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/11,12,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,16-19</a>].</p><p>The peak incidence of HL is four or more years after transplantation, in contrast to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which most commonly occurs in the first year after transplantation. In HIV infected patients, the CD4 T cell count is typically higher than in other EBV-associated lymphoma. Approximately 10 percent of newly diagnosed mixed cellularity HL in the United States is HIV-associated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Development of malignancy following solid organ transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8227303\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with HLA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only a very small minority of those infected with EBV will develop EBV-positive HL. Several studies have suggested that patients with certain major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region variations are at higher risk of progressing to EBV-positive or EBV-negative classical HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>A genome-wide association study (GWAS) evaluated the association of common genetic variants with all cases of classical HL, with EBV-negative classical HL, and with EBV-positive classical HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This study identified two MHC variants that were independently associated with both EBV-negative and EBV-positive HL, two MHC variants that were independently associated with EBV-positive classical HL, and two MHC variants that were independently associated with EBV-negative classical HL. Many of these associations were confirmed in a subsequent case-control study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>These results support the theory that persons with variations at certain MHC loci are at increased risk of developing HL. The association of some variants with EBV status suggests that there are both common mechanisms and disparate mechanisms of HL pathogenesis in EBV-negative and EBV-positive HL. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22872651\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognostic value of EBV plasma DNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EBV viral genome copy number in plasma may have prognostic value for classical HL. </p><p>A cooperative group study of adults with newly diagnosed HL reported the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma EBV genome copy number &gt;60 viral <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/100</span> microL (EBV positive) plasma demonstrated 96 percent concordance with in situ hybridization. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure-free survival (FFS) was inferior in patients who were EBV positive pretreatment, compared with those with lower pretreatment values (EBV negative). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FFS was inferior in EBV-positive patients six months after the initiation of therapy, compared with EBV-negative patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In multivariate analyses, pretreatment plasma EBV was an independent predictor of treatment failure. </p><p/><p>In children with newly diagnosed HL, EBV genome copy number in serum also had high concordance with in situ hybridization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

As described above, EBV is present in tumor cells in a substantial fraction of HL cases. Other factors in the development of HL are discussed separately.

In North America, EBV is more commonly detected in HL among Hispanics. Nodular lymphocyte predominant HL is virtually always EBV negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

EBER and LMP1 are the two EBV markers most commonly used in epidemiologic studies in HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-epstein-barr-virus#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of Epstein-Barr virus&quot;, section on 'Transformation and latent proteins'</a>.)</p><p>Research has focused on the potential pathogenic role of those EBV proteins known to be expressed in the tumor cells. EBNA1 expression is required for the replication and maintenance of the viral genome in proliferating cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. An additional role for EBNA1 in the pathogenesis of HL has not been determined. However, LMP1 and LMP2a appear to play a role in the development of at least a subset of HL cases. Reed-Sternberg cells sometimes harbor crippling mutations in their immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. B cells that lack functional Ig would be expected to die by apoptotic mechanisms. Expression of LMP1 or LMP2a may help these cells escape apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">LMP1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) encodes a transmembrane protein that resembles the tumor necrosis factor receptor CD40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In germinal centers, apoptosis of B cells can be delayed by signaling through CD40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. LMP-1 can function like a constitutively activated CD40 molecule, providing a mechanism by which the expression of EBV genes could facilitate the escape of Reed-Sternberg cells, or their precursors, from destruction in the germinal centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Support for this theory comes from murine studies demonstrating the induction of B cell lymphomas in transgenic mice with constitutive expression of LMP-1 their B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In addition, HL tumor cell lines have shown that LMP-1 activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) by promoting IkBa turnover [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The constitutive activation of NF-kB has been linked to the growth and survival of classical Reed-Sternberg cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The Reed-Sternberg cell and the pathogenesis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)'</a>.)</p><p>A third mechanism by which LMP-1 may promote the survival of Reed-Sternberg cells relates to its impact on the expression of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1). DDR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, upon binding with collagen, increases lymphoma cell survival in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. These interactions of collagen and DDR1 may therefore allow the tumor microenvironment to protect and nurture the lymphoma cells. DDR1 is commonly overexpressed in Reed-Sternberg cells that are intimately associated with collagen. Although there are other mechanisms for increased DDR1 expression, in vitro studies have also demonstrated that expression of LMP1 in germinal center B cells leads to the upregulation of DDR1. A similar upregulation would be expected in EBV-positive Reed-Sternberg cells. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">LMP2a</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Latent membrane protein 2a (LMP2a) is an integral membrane protein that co-localizes with LMP1 in the plasma membrane of EBV-infected lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. LMP2a contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif that resembles motifs carried by immunoglobulin molecules. Expression of LMP2a on the cellular membrane produces a constitutive signal that prevents apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>LMP2a has been shown to prevent apoptosis of pre-B cells that fail to express Ig molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

In such tumors, LMP2a expression may rescue cells from the programmed cell death (apoptosis) normally associated with BCR loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/54,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,57,58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathobiology of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a complex process leading to the replication of a malignant B cell clone of germinal center or post-germinal center origin.
