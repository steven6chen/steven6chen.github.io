Ageing populations and progress in the treatment of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease are increasing the prevalence of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, elderly patients at risk for HF are undergoing noncardiac surgery at increasing rates. It is estimated that HF is present in almost 20 percent of older adults undergoing common surgical procedures in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. HF is a major risk factor for adverse cardiac events, including death following noncardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Recommendations regarding perioperative cardiac evaluation and management of HF are reviewed here. </p><p>General management approaches for patients with acute and chronic HF are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Functional status is usually estimated from the patient&rsquo;s description of daily activities. One study from Seattle showed that a self-reported inability to walk four blocks (an average block length in that city is approximately 100 meters) and climb two flights of stairs without experiencing symptomatic limitation was 71 percent sensitive and 47 percent specific for serious postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Initial preoperative evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms and signs of HF include exertional dyspnea, fluid retention, and fatigue. In elderly patients, the diagnosis of early or even more advanced HF may not be made in a timely manner since these patients often lead a fairly sedentary life due to their age and other debilitating noncardiac problems. Since symptoms of HF are not specific to HF, careful physical examination and in some cases, testing is required to differentiate HF from other causes of dyspnea such as obesity, deconditioning, and lung disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The recognition of asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction may be difficult. The simplest approach is to have a high index of suspicion when an asymptomatic patient provides a history of risk factors or presents with certain physical signs (or test abnormalities as discussed below) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105826\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105826 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Physical signs that suggest HF or cardiomyopathy include resting tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, displaced apical impulse, third <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fourth heart sound, and murmur of mitral regurgitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105826\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105826 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Risk factors for development of HF include history of alcohol or cocaine abuse, prior myocardial infarction, prior cardiotoxic chemotherapy, longstanding hypertension, family history of HF, and diabetes mellitus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Identifying comorbidities that may impact postoperative outcomes is an essential part of preoperative evaluation. Triggers and risk factors for perioperative major adverse cardiac events including postoperative HF and death include myocardial ischemia (eg, ischemia-induced HF), hypertension (poorly controlled or labile), atrial fibrillation, kidney disease (especially end-stage kidney disease), and diabetes. A priori knowledge of these triggers of HF may influence clinicians to institute certain interventions early in the perioperative period such as postoperative dialysis, optimal pain control to avoid hypertension, and the preoperative use of beta blockers or antiarrhythmic medications to prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H608044847\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine preoperative testing is not generally indicated.

Further study is required to validate this risk score in external cohorts.</p><p>Risk stratification of HF patients remains a clinical challenge because no model exhibits consistent discrimination between those patients who will experience an adverse outcome versus those who do not, or reliable calibration of the likelihood of an outcome across all levels of risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H694557462\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk classification by heart failure syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the limitations of the available risk models is that history of HF or recent HF is included as a unitary factor, although operative risk of a surgical procedure varies according to HF syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

A study from the Netherlands showed that patients undergoing high-risk surgery (open vascular procedures) with asymptomatic left ventricular diastolic or systolic function were at increased risk for 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and long-term mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among patients undergoing open vascular surgery, the 30-day cardiovascular event rate was 14 percent among patients with normal left ventricular function as compared with 23 percent among patients with asymptomatic isolated left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, 31 percent among patients with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and 54 percent among patients with symptomatic HF. For lower-risk procedures (endovascular repair), only symptomatic HF was associated with significantly increased 30-day MACE and long-term cardiovascular mortality. Identifying asymptomatic patients with LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction seems prudent in view of the associated adverse outcomes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H608045182\"><span class=\"h3\">Compensated and decompensated heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased postoperative risk is present even among patients who are compensated preoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. With adjusted analysis, patients with compensated HF appear to have early perioperative mortality similar to that in patients without HF, but have longer hospital stays as well as higher readmission and long-term mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Data suggest that HF patients are at higher risk than patients with CAD for MACE following noncardiac surgery. A population-based data analysis of four cohorts of 38,047 consecutive patients showed that the 30-day postoperative mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with nonischemic HF (9.3 percent), ischemic HF (9.2 percent), and atrial fibrillation (6.4 percent) than in those with CAD (2.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In an analysis based upon Medicare files from 1997 and 1998 that included 23,340 patients with HF and 28,710 patients with CAD who underwent major noncardiac surgery, the risk-adjusted operative mortality (death before discharge or within 30 days of surgery) was 11.7 percent in HF, 6.6 percent CAD, and 6.2 percent control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Ischemia cannot be managed with anticoagulant medications until hemostasis is achieved at the operative site. Thrombolytic therapy is rarely an option because of potential bleeding in the postoperative period and because postoperative myocardial infarctions usually do not present with a clearly defined onset of chest pain or with typical electrocardiographic changes, making it difficult to know the length of time that has elapsed since the infarction began. </p><p>Management of perioperative myocardial infarction is discussed separately.
