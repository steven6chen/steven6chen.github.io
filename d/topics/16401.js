The stomach is part of the digestive system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>). There are different kinds of stomach cancer, depending on the type of cells and part of the stomach involved.</p><p>Some people who get stomach cancer have a condition called H. pylori infection. H. pylori<em> </em>is a type of bacteria that can infect the stomach and intestines. Infection with H. pylori sometimes causes symptoms such as belly pain, bloating, nausea, or vomiting. If it is not treated, it can lead to stomach cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12872010\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of stomach cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early on, stomach cancer might not cause any symptoms. When stomach cancer causes symptoms, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain, especially in the upper belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having no appetite, or feeling full after eating a small amount of food</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired or short of breath (from a condition called &quot;anemia,&quot; which is when people have too few red blood cells)</p><p/><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not stomach cancer. But if you have these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12872025\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for stomach cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Tests for stomach cancer can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper endoscopy &ndash; This is the test most often done for stomach cancer. During this test, the doctor puts a thin tube with a camera and light on the end into the mouth and down into the stomach. This lets the doctor look at the stomach lining (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy &ndash; Doctors do this test during an upper endoscopy. During a biopsy, the doctor takes a small sample of tissue from an abnormal-looking area of the stomach. Then another doctor looks at the tissue under a microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests of the stomach, such as a CT scan &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p>Your doctor will also check for H. pylori infection. Doctors can do this in different ways, including breath tests, blood tests, and other lab tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12872080\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out if a cancer has spread past the layer of tissue where it began, and, if so, how far.</p><p>The right treatment for you will depend a lot on the type and stage of your stomach cancer and your other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12872098\"><span class=\"h1\">How is stomach cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stomach cancer is usually treated with one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the cancer &ndash; During surgery, the doctor might remove part or all of your stomach. If the doctor removes all of your stomach, he or she will reconnect your digestive tract so that you can eat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Sometimes, people get chemotherapy before they have surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunotherapy &ndash; This is the term doctors use for medicines that work with the body's infection-fighting system (the &quot;immune system&quot;) to stop cancer growth.</p><p/><p>Stomach cancer can sometimes be cured with treatment. This is most likely when the cancer is found at an early stage. But, often, stomach cancer is not found at an early stage. If your stomach cancer cannot be cured, your doctor can do other treatments to help with your symptoms.</p><p>If you have H. pylori infection, your doctor will treat it with medicines. This usually involves taking 3 or more medicines for 1 to 2 weeks. Treating the H. pylori infection will make the infection go away, but it will not make the stomach cancer go away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12872113\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor will check you every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Follow-up tests might include exams, blood tests, upper endoscopy, or imaging tests.</p><p>You should also watch for the symptoms listed above. Having those symptoms could mean your stomach cancer has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12872128\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my stomach cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your stomach cancer comes back or spreads, you might have more chemotherapy or radiation therapy. You might also have other treatments to help with your symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12872143\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for stomach cancer involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12872158\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stomach-ache-and-stomach-upset-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stomach ache and stomach upset (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=h-pylori-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: H. pylori infection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Gastritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
