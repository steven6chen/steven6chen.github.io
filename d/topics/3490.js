The term &ldquo;active&rdquo; is also used if there is otorrhea, and &ldquo;inactive&rdquo; if it remains dry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26969804\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178692471\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic otitis media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, chronic ear disease often follows episodes of acute otitis media (AOM). Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is more common in lower socioeconomic areas, possibly related to delay in treatment for AOM, poorer hygienic conditions, increased smoking, or poorer nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The point in time when AOM becomes CSOM is controversial, with definitions ranging from two weeks to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>CSOM in adults occurs in patients with perforation of the tympanic membrane that will not heal. Typically, there is a history of recurrent ear infections in childhood, with longstanding (months or years) of otorrhea and hearing loss made worse by water exposure.</p><p>Chronic ear disease occurs as a result of eustachian tube dysfunction, typically related to obstruction (usually due to upper respiratory infection or seasonal allergic rhinitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. By contrast, abnormal patency of the eustachian tube, termed patulous eustachian tube, does not cause infection but results in such symptoms as autophony (hearing one's own voice) and ear fullness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Rarely, chronic otitis media (COM) with effusion is caused by obstruction of the eustachian tube orifice in the nasopharynx by a mass or cancer such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or as a result of radiation treatment for nasopharyngeal malignancy.</p><p>Eustachian tube dysfunction results in chronic negative middle ear pressure exerted on the tympanic membrane, the most compliant boundary of the middle ear. Negative pressure pulls the tympanic membrane medially, and retraction pockets can occur with prolonged exposure, usually within the pars flaccida of the tympanic membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57110 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This segment of the tympanic membrane accounts for the upper one-sixth of the surface area of the tympanic membrane and lies superior to the anterior and posterior malleolar folds of the tympanic membrane.</p><p>When a patient has AOM, a serous, mucoid, or purulent effusion builds up behind the tympanic membrane. Tympanic membrane rupture and otorrhea may occur if the positive pressure exerted by this effusion exceeds the tensile strength of the tympanic membrane and eustachian tube dysfunction prevents pressure equilibration. Spontaneous perforations produced under these conditions are part of the compensatory mechanism of the ear and provide a conduit for aeration similar to that produced by myringotomy tubes. In some cases where there are multiple episodes of acute infection, the perforation may become chronic (non-closing). In such instances, the outer epithelial layer of the tympanic membrane grows over the perforation edges, covering the middle fibrous and inner mucosal layers, and prevents the perforation from closing.</p><p>Perforations of the tympanic membrane are classified as central when the annulus (the ligamentous ring surrounding the tympanic membrane) is preserved and marginal when a portion of the annulus or the entire annulus is involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The annulus serves as a protective barrier against squamous epithelial migration into the middle ear. Marginal perforations are more frequently associated with cholesteatoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26969826\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholesteatoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term cholesteatoma refers to a keratinized, desquamated epithelial collection in the middle ear or mastoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The nomenclature of cholesteatoma is misleading, with keratoma perhaps being a better term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Cholesteatomas contain no cholesterol or lipids and are not neoplastic. Cholesteatomas may occur as primary lesions or may be secondary to tympanic membrane perforation or surgery. Congenital cholesteatomas are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholesteatoma-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholesteatoma in children&quot;, section on 'Congenital cholesteatomas'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary acquired </strong>&ndash; Primary acquired cholesteatomas occur most commonly as a result of eustachian tube dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76079\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76079 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Prolonged exposure to negative middle ear pressure causes the tympanic membrane to retract medially. A retraction pocket may eventually become trapped behind the tympanic membrane, inducing inflammatory changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. This epithelium-lined pocket accumulates keratinized squamous debris, which forms a cholesteatoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59937\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59937 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. Poor middle ear ventilation results in delayed resolution of infection, persistence of effusion, and ultimately a retracted or perforated tympanic membrane. With growth and proliferation of squamous epithelium, the cholesteatoma grows in size, often eroding the scutum (the sharp edge of the tympanic ring adjacent to the head of the malleus). Further infection with inflammatory changes can lead to aural polyps and granulation tissue throughout the middle ear and mastoid air cell tracts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Secondary acquired </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Tympanic membrane perforation may lead to a secondary acquired cholesteatoma in a small percentage of cases. Squamous epithelium can migrate through the tympanic membrane defect into the middle ear space, and accumulations of squamous debris result in the cholesteatoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/11,13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,17</a>]. An iatrogenic form of secondary acquired cholesteatoma may develop if squamous epithelium is implanted in the middle ear space during surgery such as tympanoplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>Cholesteatomas may result in erosion of the ossicles in the middle ear and consequent hearing loss. In rare cases, they can erode directly into the inner ear. An earlier theory attributed bony erosion to pressure necrosis from the expanding cholesteatoma itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Several other mechanisms are now recognized as the cause of bone destruction: enzymatic breakdown of collagen by collagenase, acid phosphatase, and acid protease produced by the cholesteatoma; osteoclastic bone resorption; and pyogenic osteitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The WHO definition requires that otorrhea be present for only two weeks, but the focus of WHO is primarily on worldwide disease prevention in children. Practically, most otolaryngologists consider the diagnosis of CSOM to be established when discharge persists, despite treatment, for periods varying from six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] to up to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The most common symptom of CSOM is the presence of recurrent or persistent purulent ear drainage. CSOM is most often painless, and patients usually present without fever or other systemic signs of infection. The drainage may be foul smelling.</p><p>Patients typically also report hearing loss. The degree of hearing loss is related to the location and size of the tympanic membrane perforation, the status of the ossicles, as well as to the duration of chronic damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Physical examination is notable for otorrhea in the presence of a perforated tympanic membrane.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98017516\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholesteatoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical presenting features of cholesteatoma may vary. Some patients may be totally asymptomatic. Others may present with some combination of hearing loss, dizziness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> otorrhea. Cholesteatomas associated with tympanic membrane perforation are typically detected earlier than primary acquired cholesteatomas as the inferior portion of the ear drum is easier to inspect, and hearing loss occurs early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Hearing loss occurs late in the course of primary cholesteatomas since the pars flaccida is the non-vibratory portion of the tympanic membrane. Late conductive hearing loss is also due to erosion of the ossicles, typically the distal portion of the incus. Hearing loss can occur earlier when cholesteatomas are associated with tympanic membrane perforation (eg, secondary cholesteatomas) due to involvement of the vibratory surface area of the tympanic membrane (pars tensa).</p><p>The otoscopic findings in cholesteatoma depend on the type of cholesteatoma (primary or secondary).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20907628\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary cholesteatoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary acquired cholesteatomas are typically found in the posterosuperior quadrant of the tympanic membrane, in the pars flaccida (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76079\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76079 \">picture 2</a>).

This may require otomicroscopy with suctioning, necessitating referral to an otolaryngologist. For routine serous otitis media, the drum is typically intact with a yellowish hue, or there may be visible air bubbles behind the tympanic membrane. In cases of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), there is typically a perforation that may be partial or complete, often with associated purulent otorrhea and inflamed middle ear mucosa. In the case of a primary cholesteatoma, the otoscopic examination will reveal a retracted area of the tympanic membrane, usually of the pars flaccida but also occasionally of the pars tensa, that contains squamous debris or inflammatory tissue. Alternatively, there may be an obstructive polyp. Pictures of primary cholesteatomas are shown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F88598\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88598 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F88599\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88599 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F88600\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88600 \">picture 6</a>).

Mastoid effusion is often seen on computed tomography (CT) scan in patients with both acute otitis media (AOM) and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and is not usually clinically significant. Symptomatic coalescent mastoiditis is a rare complication of both AOM and chronic otitis media (COM) but can be serious due to proximity of the mastoid to the posterior cranial fossa, lateral sinuses, facial nerve canal, semicircular canals, and the petrous tip of the temporal bone. Mastoiditis complicating CSOM can result in bony erosion and temporal lobe abscess or can cause septic thrombosis of the lateral sinus.</p><p>Acute mastoiditis occurs more commonly in children than adults, and its incidence has declined dramatically in the antibiotic era with routine use of antibiotics for treatment of otitis media. It is a rare occurrence in adults but can complicate CSOM with or without cholesteatoma. One study that reviewed almost 3000 cases of CSOM in a nine-year period in Turkey reported 25 cases of mastoid abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Clinical mastoiditis may present with fever, posterior ear pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> local erythema over the mastoid bone, edema of the pinna, or a posteriorly and downward displaced auricle.

If patients do not respond to conservative therapy with IV antibiotics, further intervention is warranted. This involves mastoidectomy for debridement of necrotic bone. Myringotomy is an adjunct to mastoidectomy for the treatment of acute mastoiditis. When cholesteatoma is present, a tympanomastoidectomy is performed to remove both the necrotic bone in the mastoid and cholesteatoma.

More formally, tympanoplasty is a procedure to eradicate disease in the middle ear and reconstruct the ossicular chain, which may or may not involve tympanic membrane grafting or mastoid surgery. The decision of whether to proceed with tympanoplasty rests upon a number of principles, including the desire to improve hearing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the need to close off the middle ear to avoid infection when water enters the canal.</p><p>Tympanoplasty is generally performed after infection has been eradicated for a minimum of three months.</p><p>Tympanoplasty is typically carried out through either an endaural incision for smaller cholesteatomas or a postauricular incision for larger ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>The two main types of tympanoplasty are medial graft and lateral graft tympanoplasty.

The goal of surgery is eradication of disease and improved aeration of the mastoid-middle ear system.</p><p>Intact canal wall versus canal wall down approaches differ in the exposure they offer, technical difficulty, prospects for postoperative hearing, and needs for postoperative care. In canal wall intact mastoidectomy, the air cells of the mastoid are removed while the posterior bony external auditory canal wall is kept intact. Intact canal wall procedures provide greater convenience of postoperative care and often promote a better level of conductive hearing. Maintaining the bony canal obviates the need to take precautions against exposure to water and typically provides a better fit for a hearing aid if one is needed postoperatively.

There is a risk of recurrent discharge from bacterial or fungal overgrowth on retained debris within the open cavity. This underscores the need for postoperative vigilance over years and maintenance of a clean, safe cavity with regular cleaning by an otolaryngologist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52515\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52515 \">picture 7</a>). It is crucial that a wide meatoplasty be performed to enable inspection of the complete extent of the mastoid cavity.</p><p>No controlled prospective studies are available that compare intact canal versus canal wall down procedures. Outcomes reported from case series comparing the two techniques likely involve selection bias, as intact canal wall mastoidectomies tend to be reserved for more limited disease while more aggressive cholesteatomas will often be treated with canal wall down mastoidectomies. A 2014 systematic review of studies of cholesteatoma treated with mastoidectomy was unable to come to conclusions about best practices; individual studies reported different outcome measures and could not be compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Recurrent cholesteatomas are more common in intact canal wall procedures due to the formation of retraction pockets in the grafted drum into the middle ear, epitympanum, or facial recess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/70,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,73</a>]. An intact canal wall procedure for cholesteatoma usually requires re-exploration within one year to rule out residual or recurrent disease; residual or recurrent cholesteatoma is found in re-exploration of canal wall intact procedures in approximately one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/70,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,73</a>]. Re-exploration enables the detection of lesions that are typically less than 5 mm in greatest diameter and enables complete removal with minimal dissection. Multiple recurrences of cholesteatomas are not uncommon. In some cases, a very active recurrent cholesteatoma found during the second stage procedure may warrant a more radical procedure in which the canal wall is removed.</p><p>Mastoid cavities are occasionally obliterated using homograft or allograft materials. Advantages of obliteration include less cold sensitivity, improved hearing, and decreased drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. However, such reconstructions may be susceptible to recurrent infection either due to primary infection of the graft material, or blockage of adjacent air cell tracts, and recurrent disease if the primary cholesteatoma matrix was not completely eradicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26969938\"><span class=\"h2\">Ossicular chain reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholesteatoma and chronic otitis media (COM) have the propensity to erode bone. In many cases, the small ossicular chain bones (malleus, incus, and stapes) are either partially or totally destroyed secondary to cholesteatoma and chronic infection. The long process of the incus, due to its relatively scant vascular supply, appears especially vulnerable to bony destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>When chronic ear disease results in significant hearing loss due to ossicular involvement, an important component of surgical therapy is reconstruction of the ossicular chain. Ossicular chain reconstruction employs a partial or total prosthesis to provide a medium for sound conduction where ossicular discontinuity is present.</p><p>Hearing rehabilitation surgery is frequently performed as part of a second-stage procedure after tympanomastoidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. With improvements in prosthesis material selection and design, combined with a better understanding of indications for ossicular reconstruction, hearing rehabilitation is often successfully achieved in the treatment of chronic ear disorders. Closure of the air-bone gap to within 20 dB has been reported in 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3688538153\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-otitis-media-and-external-otitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Otitis media and external otitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14110098\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic otitis media (COM) is a recurrent infection of the middle ear <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mastoid air cell tract in the presence of a tympanic membrane perforation. Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is diagnosed when there is persistent purulent drainage through a perforated tympanic membrane. Cholesteatoma refers to a keratinized, desquamated epithelial collection in the middle ear or mastoid and may occur secondary to tympanic membrane perforation but also may occur as a primary lesion. (See <a href=\"#H26969760\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic ear disease occurs as a result of eustachian tube dysfunction with negative middle ear pressure causing rupture of the tympanic membrane. Cholesteatomas may occur as primary lesions or may be secondary to tympanic membrane perforation or surgery. Cholesteatomas may result in erosion of the ossicles in the middle ear and consequent conductive hearing loss and rarely cause a sensorineural hearing loss due to erosion into the labyrinth. (See <a href=\"#H26969804\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> are the most commonly isolated aerobic bacteria in several large case series of CSOM. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) varies by region. Less frequently, Gram-negative rods or anaerobes are found and fungi are occasionally reported. Cholesteatoma can be associated with a polymicrobial infection, but the most commonly isolated pathogens remain <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. (See <a href=\"#H26969833\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although definitions vary, most otolaryngologists consider the diagnosis of CSOM when discharge persists through a tympanic membrane perforation for six weeks to three months. CSOM is often painless, though hearing loss is often reported. Cholesteatomas are often asymptomatic, or may be associated with hearing loss, dizziness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> otorrhea. The presence of cholesteatoma should always be investigated in patients with CSOM and usually requires otomicroscopy. (See <a href=\"#H25111276\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CSOM can often be made with direct otoscopy, but referral to an otolaryngologist for otomicroscopy with suctioning is indicated if the diagnosis is unclear or inadequate visualization precludes the ability to rule out a cholesteatoma. Cultures obtained by direct ear swabbing are not helpful due to contamination. Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is indicated if extracranial complications are suspected (patients with systemic illness); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated if an intracranial complication is suspected and may be an adjunct to CT for evaluation of cholesteatoma for operative planning. (See <a href=\"#H178692374\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While a mastoid effusion and inflammation is commonly seen by CT in patients with acute otitis media (AOM) or COM, symptomatic mastoiditis is a rare and potentially serious complication. Clinical mastoiditis may present with fever, ear pain, edema, and a displaced auricle. Treatment includes aggressive antibiotics to include coverage for <em>S. aureus</em> and enteric Gram-negative rods when associated with chronic otitis. Surgery is required if an abscess is present. (See <a href=\"#H178692617\" class=\"local\">'Mastoiditis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of CSOM include facial nerve palsy, suppurative thrombophlebitis of the lateral or cavernous sinuses, meningitis, and intracranial abscesses. (See <a href=\"#H178692489\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend initial treatment for CSOM with a topical quinolone antibiotic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Due to the potential for ototoxicity in the presence of a ruptured tympanic membrane, we suggest not using topical aminoglycosides when alternative agents are available (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We recommend not using systemic antibiotics as an adjunct to topical drops for initial treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). However, systemic antibiotics are indicated for patients with complications of CSOM, for those who fail to respond to topical therapy after two to three weeks, and for those who have been previously treated with several courses of empiric topical therapy and are at risk for resistant organisms. Cultures should be obtained prior to initiating systemic antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H26969894\" class=\"local\">'Medical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there are no randomized controlled trials evaluating its use, aural irrigation can be of benefit in treating COM when used as a supplement to antibiotic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is indicated for patients who develop complications of chronic otitis, to remove infected tissue in the middle ear or mastoid, and to repair ear damage that results in hearing loss. Surgery is also indicated for management of cholesteatoma, as spontaneous resolution is not expected. Surgery may include mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ossicular reconstruction.
