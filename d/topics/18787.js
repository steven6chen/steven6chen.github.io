Some clinicians also consider physiological tests, known as weaning predictors, because they are hesitant to begin weaning on the basis of clinical criteria alone. The clinical criteria and weaning predictors are defined and described below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weaning &ndash; Weaning is the process of decreasing ventilator support and allowing patients to assume a greater proportion of their ventilation. It may involve either an immediate shift from full ventilatory support to a period of breathing without assistance from the ventilator (ie, a spontaneous breathing trial [SBT]) or a gradual reduction in the amount of ventilator support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Regardless of which approach is chosen, extubation is considered once the patient demonstrates the ability to breathe without the ventilator and both airway patency and airway protection have been assessed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extubation-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extubation management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Readiness testing is reviewed here. Weaning and extubation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extubation-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extubation management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PURPOSE OF READINESS TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Readiness testing has two major purposes. The first is to identify patients who are ready to wean from mechanical ventilation. This is important because clinicians tend to underestimate the capacity of patients to breathe independently. Unnecessary mechanical ventilation needlessly increases the risk of complications related to mechanical ventilation.</p><p>Potential complications of mechanical ventilation include pulmonary barotrauma, ventilator-associated lung injury, ventilator-associated pneumonia, sinusitis, airway injury, venous thromboembolism, and gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, mortality is associated with both prolonged weaning and the duration of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. While this association may simply be a marker of the severity of illness, the complications associated with mechanical ventilation may also contribute. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pathophysiologic-consequences-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventilator-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventilator-induced lung injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis, management, and prevention of pulmonary barotrauma during invasive mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The tendency of clinicians to underestimate the capacity of patients to breathe independently from the ventilator was initially suggested by two randomized trials that found that 65 to 85 percent of the patients tolerated discontinuation of mechanical ventilation on the same day that their readiness to wean was first assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This was supported by a subsequent case-control study that found that 50 percent of patients who self-extubated never required reintubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The second major purpose of readiness testing is to identify patients who are not ready for weaning, thereby protecting them against the risks of premature weaning (eg, cardiovascular dysfunction, respiratory muscle fatigue, psychological distress).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CRITERIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A consensus conference composed of clinicians with expertise in discontinuing mechanical ventilation proposed several clinical criteria that can be used to identify patients who are ready to begin weaning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62377 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. All of the criteria are objective, since clinicians are poor at predicting readiness to wean on the basis of their subjective impression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. However, even objective criteria are imperfect, since up to 30 percent of patients who never satisfy such criteria can be successfully weaned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The criteria can be segregated into required and optional criteria. All of the criteria derive from observational studies that found that they predicted safe weaning, as well as from the experience of the clinicians who attended the consensus conference. None of the criteria have been validated in randomized trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Required criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are required criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cause of the respiratory failure has improved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate oxygenation &ndash; This may be indicated by either a ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>)</span> &ge;150 mmHg or an oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) &ge;90 percent while receiving an FiO<sub>2</sub> &le;40 percent and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) &le;5 to 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. For patients who have chronic hypoxemia, a PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> &ge;120 mmHg may be used instead. These thresholds are empiric, since no study has established a minimal acceptable PaO<sub>2</sub>, PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>,</span> SpO<sub>2</sub>, or alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient for weaning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial pH &gt;7.25</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamic stability, without myocardial ischemia &ndash; The blood pressure thresholds below or above which it is unsafe for a patient to wean have not been established. However, it seems reasonable to require that the systolic blood pressure be &gt;90 mmHg or &lt;180 mmHg to begin weaning. The use of vasopressors to maintain the systolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg is acceptable, but only low doses should be necessary (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is able to initiate an inspiratory effort.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Optional criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast, the following criteria are optional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin level &ge;7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> &ndash; Previously, any degree of anemia was considered a contraindication to weaning because it reduces oxygen carrying capacity. However, only severe anemia is currently considered a contraindication to weaning. The change is largely due to a secondary analysis of a randomized trial that compared a restrictive blood transfusion strategy (ie, maintain hemoglobin level of 7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> to a liberal strategy (ie, maintain a hemoglobin level of 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The analysis found that the strategies had no effect on the rate of successful weaning (78 versus 82 percent). A single center retrospective study of 138 difficult to wean patients (failed more than two spontaneous breathing trials [SBTs] or required seven days from first SBT to successful weaning) found a higher probability of weaning success for patients with a hemoglobin level of &gt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. No difference in weaning success was found when comparing patients with hemoglobin levels of 8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> to those with &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Core temperature &le;38 to 38.5&ordm;C &ndash; The rationale for this criterion is that the presence of fever makes successful weaning less likely because it increases the minute ventilation and, thus, the load on the respiratory system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is also associated with rapid breathing. Patients whose fever is caused by sepsis may also have diminished respiratory muscle function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A temperature threshold above which weaning is unsafe has not been identified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mental status that is either awake and alert, or easily arousable &ndash; This criterion is considered optional because although an awake or easily arousable patient is ideal for weaning, an abnormal mental status (ie, Glasgow Coma Scale score &lt;8 or the inability to follow simple commands) does not appear to be associated with a higher rate of extubation failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Thus, as long as a patient can protect the airway, an abnormal mental status does not preclude extubation. Evaluation of the ability to protect the airway is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extubation-management#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extubation management&quot;, section on 'Airway protection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability of these objective clinical criteria alone to assess a patient's readiness to wean (without the aid of a weaning predictor) is described below. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Approach to readiness testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">WEANING PREDICTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some clinicians are hesitant to begin weaning on the basis of clinical criteria alone. Thus, they also use physiological tests to predict whether a patient is likely to tolerate weaning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78201\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78201 \">table 2</a>). These physiological tests are called weaning predictors.</p><p>Weaning predictor measurements should identify all patients ready to breathe independently and they should be safe and easy to perform, highly reproducible, and not subject to confounding influences. They should also use equipment and techniques that are routinely available in intensive care units. Measurements that require special equipment or invasive techniques are unlikely to find widespread use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Rapid shallow breathing index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume <span class=\"nowrap\">(f/VT)</span>. It is the most extensively studied and commonly used weaning predictor. Its definition, accuracy, effect on clinical outcomes, and measurement are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: The rapid shallow breathing index&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although adequate oxygenation is an essential clinical criterion to consider when deciding whether a patient is ready to wean (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical criteria'</a> above), it is a poor weaning predictor when used alone to predict weaning outcome. This was illustrated by two studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial investigating the impact of daily awakening trials, spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) were safe and often successful even among patients with relatively poor oxygenation (eg, a PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> of only 110 to 120) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective cohort study of 269 patients found that a ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>)</span> &ge;238 mmHg predicted weaning success with a negative predictive value of only 10 percent (the positive predictive value was 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These results should be interpreted with caution because the positive predictive value may be higher and the negative predictive value may be lower than in most populations, since the pretest probability of weaning success was unusually high (90 percent) in the study.</p><p/><p>The reason that indices of oxygenation are poor weaning predictors is probably test referral bias, which exists when the test being studied is used to select patients for a reference standard test. In this case, most of the studies required adequate oxygenation (the test being studied) in order to begin weaning (the reference standard). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-diagnostic-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating diagnostic tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Minute ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The total minute ventilation estimates the demand on the respiratory system. It is approximately 5 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">liters/min</span> in healthy individuals at rest, but increases among patients who are mechanically ventilated or have increased carbon dioxide production (eg, fever, hypermetabolic states), metabolic acidosis, hypoxemia, increased dead space, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an increased central respiratory drive.</p><p>Since elevated total minute ventilation is indicative of increased respiratory demand, it is reasonable to expect that elevated total minute ventilation might predict weaning failure. However, a systematic review found that minute ventilation is a poor predictor of weaning outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The positive and negative predictive values were low and the likelihood ratio positive (LR+) ranged from 0.87 to 2.37, indicating that there is little or no increase in the probability of weaning among patients whose minute ventilation does not exceed a particular threshold (usually &gt;10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">liters/min)</span>. Likelihood ratios are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72793\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72793 \">table 3</a>) and separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: The rapid shallow breathing index&quot;, section on 'Accuracy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Maximal inspiratory pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP or PImax) is a global assessment of the strength of the inspiratory muscles. It can be measured by attaching an aneroid manometer to the opening of the endotracheal tube and asking the patient to maximally inspire against an occluded airway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of respiratory muscle strength&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Initial studies suggested that a MIP of -30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O or less (ie, more negative) was associated with successful weaning, while a MIP of -20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O or more (ie, less negative) was associated with weaning failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, a subsequent systematic review of more than 30 studies found that the MIP is a poor predictor of weaning outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The systematic review found that an adequate MIP predicts weaning success with a low sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, the pooled LR+ ranged from 1.15 to 1.57, while the pooled likelihood ratio negative (LR-) ranged from 0.31 to 0.65. These results indicate that there is little or no increase in the probability of weaning success among patients with a normal MIP, but a small increase in the probability of weaning failure among patients with a reduced MIP. Likelihood ratios are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72793\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72793 \">table 3</a>) and separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: The rapid shallow breathing index&quot;, section on 'Accuracy'</a>.)</p><p>One reason for the poor predictive capacity of the MIP may be its ability to assess only respiratory muscle strength and not the load placed on those muscles. In addition, accurate measurement of the MIP in a spontaneously breathing patient is challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The MIP tends to be underestimated because of insufficient patient effort. This can be improved by using a one-way valve that allows the patient to expire but not inspire. Keeping the valve occluded up to 20 to 25 seconds will move the patient to a maximal effort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Compliance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Static respiratory system compliance (Cst,rs) is an indirect quantification of the work of breathing that is required to overcome the elastic forces of the respiratory system. It is estimated during a condition of zero gas flow:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Cst,rs = VT <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> (plateau pressure - PEEP)</p></div></div><p>where PEEP is the positive end-expiratory pressure. In a prospective cohort study, a decreased Cst,rs of 33 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/cm</span> H<sub>2</sub>O (normal 60 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/cm</span> H<sub>2</sub>O) had a poor predictive capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The poor predictive capacity may be due to the inability of the Cst,rs to account for the capacity of the respiratory muscles to meet the increased load that the decreased compliance suggests is present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Occlusion pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory drive can be estimated by measuring the airway pressure generated in the first 0.1 second (P0.1) during an inspiratory effort against an occluded airway. This technique required the use of special equipment to perform the airway occlusion in the past, but some currently available ventilators can measure the P0.1.</p><p>The P0.1 is less than 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in normal subjects. Patients who fail weaning have a higher P0.1 because they have an elevated respiratory drive. Values greater than 4 to 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O have been associated with weaning failure in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>The predictive accuracy of the P0.1 appears to increase significantly when the airway occlusion pressure is normalized for maximal inspiratory pressure (P0.<span class=\"nowrap\">1/MIP)</span>. Higher values are associated with weaning failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Work of breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The work of breathing can be calculated from the tidal volume and the intrathoracic pressure that is generated by respiratory muscle contraction (measured using an esophageal balloon). It has been studied as a potential weaning predictor because it tends to be higher among patients who fail weaning compared to those who successfully wean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. However, a precise value that discriminates patients who are likely to successfully wean from those who are likely to fail weaning has not been identified. The finding that the work of breathing may be helpful as a weaning predictor has not been universal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric mucosal acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood flow may be diverted from the splanchnic vascular bed to the respiratory muscles during weaning in order to meet the oxygen demands of the respiratory muscles. This is most severe during weaning failure and may result in gastric mucosal acidosis (or gastric mucosal ischemia). Thus, gastric mucosal acidosis may be an indicator of weaning failure, although its utility is limited by the need for a special nasogastric tube.</p><p>The concept was supported by several studies. A study of 29 mechanically ventilated patients found a lower gastric mucosal pH in patients who failed weaning compared to those successfully weaned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Another study of 19 mechanically ventilated patients found both a lower gastric mucosal pH and higher intraluminal gastric carbon dioxide (PgCO<sub>2</sub>) among patients who failed weaning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxygen cost of breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) cost of breathing is the difference between total O<sub>2</sub> consumption during spontaneous breathing and during relaxed mechanical ventilation. Its measurement requires special equipment (ie, a metabolic cart) that is not routinely available in most intensive care units.</p><p>The O<sub>2</sub> cost of breathing is &lt;5 percent of the total O<sub>2</sub> consumption in most healthy subjects. It can exceed 50 percent in patients who are being weaned and tends to be highest among patients who are failing weaning; however, studies have failed to identify a threshold value that accurately discriminates patients who are at increased risk for weaning failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].

Thus, it is not surprising that predictors targeting a single pathophysiologic mechanism tend to be unreliable.

The group that used objective clinical criteria alone took one day less to discontinue mechanical ventilation.

Weaning predictors were not measured. Those who passed the screen were immediately shifted to a period of breathing without assistance from the ventilator (ie, a spontaneous breathing trial [SBT]). More than 50 percent of patients who underwent an SBT tolerated it and those who failed the SBT did not suffer any adverse consequences.</p><p/><p>We use weaning predictors very sparingly. The rare situation in which we consider using a weaning predictor is when a patient has been deemed ready to wean according to clinical criteria, but enough uncertainty lingers that a confirmatory test is desired. This is most pertinent among patients in whom the risk associated with a failed spontaneous trial is significantly elevated. The goal is to identify patients who are not ready to wean in order to avoid the risks of failed weaning. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Purpose of readiness testing'</a> above.)</p><p>The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is our preferred weaning indicator because it is well studied, easy to measure, and no alternative weaning predictor has been shown to be superior to the RSBI.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Readiness testing is imperfect and some patients deemed ready to wean will fail. Despite the theoretical risks, failed weaning has not been shown to be harmful if it is well monitored and the patient is returned to full ventilatory support at the first sign of intolerance. In a study of more than 1000 patients who underwent an SBT, only one complication was identified (&lt;0.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Another study of 19 patients who underwent an SBT found that low frequency fatigue, which can hinder future weaning attempts, did not occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Finally, an observational study found no difference in mortality when patients who passed their first SBT (followed by successful extubation) were compared with those who failed their first SBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15357740\"><span class=\"h2\">Automated readiness testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protocols have been used by many ICUs to encourage the early identification of patients that are ready to wean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].
