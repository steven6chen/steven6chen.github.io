Progressive rectal distension leads to reflex relaxation of the internal anal sphincter. The urge to defecate increases as stool continues to enter the rectum from the sigmoid colon. When defecation is desired, the anorectal angle is voluntarily straightened (which is facilitated by squatting or sitting), and abdominal pressure is increased by straining. This results in descent of the pelvic floor, contraction of the rectum, and inhibition of the external anal sphincter, thereby evacuating the rectal contents.</p><p>Continence depends upon a number of factors including mental function, stool volume and consistency, colonic transit, rectal distensibility, anal sphincter function, anorectal sensation, and anorectal reflexes. Within the anorectum, anatomic barriers that help preserve continence include the rectum, the internal anal sphincter, external anal sphincter, and puborectalis muscle.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rectum contains three distinctive semilunar mucosal folds, which help to maintain its capacitance. The rectum can accommodate up to 300 mL without any significant increase in intraluminal pressure. Beyond 300 mL of volume, the intraluminal pressure increases and results in a feeling of urgency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Reflex contraction of the rectosigmoid junction occurs when large volumes enter the sigmoid colon, thereby preventing contents from passing directly to the rectum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This reflex has been referred to as the &quot;rectosigmoid junction guarding reflex.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The internal anal sphincter is a thickened, circular smooth-muscle layer innervated by the enteric nervous system. It is tonically contracted and accounts for 80 to 85 percent of the anal canal resting pressure. The internal anal sphincter relaxes transiently in response to rectal distension, a reflex known as the anorectal inhibitory reflex. The role of the anorectal inhibitory reflex is not entirely clear, although it may permit the sampling of rectal contents by sensory receptors in the anal canal, thereby helping to distinguish solid from liquid stool or gas. It does not appear to be essential for continence since continence is preserved even with an absent anorectal inhibitory reflex, as typically occurs following ileoanal anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The external anal sphincter and the puborectalis muscle represent the voluntary components of fecal continence, since they are composed of striated muscle with somatic innervation (the external anal sphincter by the pudendal nerve and the puborectalis muscles by pelvic branches of S3 to S4). Despite their independent innervation, the external anal sphincter and puborectalis muscle function as a unit. Contraction of the external anal sphincter normally doubles the pressure in the anal canal, although this pressure cannot be sustained for more than a few minutes. A spinal reflex causes the external anal sphincter to contract during sudden increases in intraabdominal pressure, such as coughing or lifting, thereby helping to maintain continence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The puborectalis muscle is part of the pelvic diaphragm, which consists of the levator ani, pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus, and the puborectalis muscle. The puborectalis muscle originates from the pubic arch, loops posteriorly behind the rectum and then travels back to the pubic arch, thereby forming a sling around the anorectum. This angle (which is typically between 80 and 110 degrees at rest, and less than 80 degrees during voluntary squeeze) helps maintain continence by forming an anatomic barrier against the discharge of stool. Dysfunction of the levator ani muscle appears to have a strong association with the severity of incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of continence can result from dysfunction of the anal sphincters, abnormal rectal compliance, decreased rectal sensation, altered stool consistency, or a combination of any of these abnormalities. Incontinence is usually multifactorial, since these derangements often coexist. Mild impairment of any one mechanism will usually not cause incontinence, since the other mechanisms for maintaining continence can usually compensate. Patients with urge incontinence often have weakness of the external anal sphincter as well as decreased rectal capacity and rectal hypersensitivity, and patients with passive fecal incontinence often have weakness of the internal anal sphincter. Some of the more common causes of incontinence will be discussed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74995 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Anal sphincter weakness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anal sphincter weakness may be due to traumatic or atraumatic causes. Atraumatic causes of anal sphincter weakness include neurologic disorders such as diabetes or spinal cord injury, or infiltrative disorders (eg, systemic sclerosis). Decreased anal sphincter pressures can result from anal trauma, such as after childbirth or surgery on the anal sphincter or surrounding structures (eg, anal fistulas, hemorrhoids, or uncommonly after injection of botulinum toxin for anal fissures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Anal sphincter laceration or trauma to the pudendal nerve during vaginal delivery may result in fecal incontinence. Fecal incontinence may occur immediately or many years after delivery. Risk factors for fecal incontinence after vaginal delivery include the use of forceps, a high-birthweight infant, a long second stage of labor, and occipitoposterior presentation of the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, all anal sphincter tears do not result in fecal incontinence. A systematic review that included more than 100 patients who underwent endoanal ultrasonography after vaginal delivery estimated that anal sphincter defects were detectable in 27 percent of primiparous women, but only 29 percent of women with an anal sphincter defect were symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a population-based study, rectal urgency, rather than obstetrical sphincter injury, appeared to be the main risk factor for fecal incontinence in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of pregnancy and childbirth on anal sphincter function and fecal incontinence&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased perception of rectal sensation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of conditions are associated with impaired rectal sensation including diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, dementia, meningomyelocele, and spinal cord injuries. Patients with diabetes mellitus can have reduced internal anal sphincter resting pressure, which may result in incontinence. Diarrhea secondary to autonomic neuropathy may also contribute to fecal incontinence in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic autonomic neuropathy of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased rectal compliance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreased rectal compliance leads to increased frequency and urgency of bowel movements because the ability of the rectum to store fecal matter is reduced. This can lead to fecal incontinence even if sphincter function is normal. Disorders associated with decreased rectal compliance include ulcerative proctitis, radiation proctitis, and proctectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/19,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29</a>].

Hard stools results in fecal impaction that produces constant inhibition of internal anal sphincter tone, permitting leakage of liquid stool around the impaction. A number of factors may contribute to the development of fecal impaction in older adults including impaired mental function, immobility, rectal hyposensitivity, and inadequate intake of fluids and dietary fiber. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-the-older-adult#H29212429\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constipation in the older adult&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic fecal incontinence occurs most commonly in middle-aged or older women. Although by definition, the cause cannot be identified, it is probably due to denervation of pelvic floor muscles resulting from stretch injury to pudendal and sacral nerves as might occur following a prolonged vaginal delivery or defecatory straining and is often associated with disorders of the anal <span class=\"nowrap\">sphincters/puborectalis,</span> rectal capacity or sensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of patients with fecal incontinence begins with a history, physical examination, and endoscopic evaluation. In patients who fail to respond to initial management, we perform additional testing to detect functional and structural abnormalities of the anal sphincters, the rectal wall, and the puborectalis muscle and provide a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology that is needed to guide management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management#H898962499\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fecal incontinence in adults: Management&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1148369122\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should initially focus on determining whether fecal incontinence is truly present, and its severity. True incontinence must be differentiated from frequency and urgency without loss of bowel contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Questions should focus on the onset, duration, frequency, amount (small stain, moderate amount but not a full bowel movement or a full bowel movement), type of leakage (solid, liquid, or gas), presence of urgency, nocturnal episodes (eg, diabetes, scleroderma), and precipitating events (occurring in the setting of diarrhea, medication use). The presence of lower back or perineal pain and motor or sensory symptoms in the lower extremities, and urinary incontinence are suggestive of a neurological cause of incontinence (eg, spinal cord lesion). A history of prior anorectal surgery, pelvic irradiation, diabetes, or neurologic disease should be sought. Obstetric history should include the number of vaginal deliveries, prolonged labor, the use of forceps, and perineal laceration. The patient should also be asked if tissue ever protrudes from the anal canal to suggest the presence of hemorrhoidal disease or a rectal prolapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1148369178\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should include inspection of the perianal area and a digital rectal examination. Inspection of the perianal area may reveal chemical dermatitis, suggesting chronic incontinence, a fistula, prolapsing hemorrhoids, or rectal prolapse. Perianal sensation should be tested by evoking the anocutaneous reflex (anal wink sign). This is done by gently stroking the skin immediately surrounding the anus and observing a reflexive contraction of the external anal sphincter. An anal wink should be elicited bilaterally. The absence of this reflex suggests nerve damage and interruption of the spinal arc.</p><p>Digital rectal examination should be performed to detect obvious anal pathology (such as a mass or fecal impaction) and provide a basic assessment of the anal resting tone that is mostly due to tonic contraction of the internal anal sphincter. Patients should be instructed to bear down and then to squeeze against the finger, which permits appreciation of the movement and angle of the puborectalis muscle, pelvic floor descent, and squeeze pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Weak squeeze pressure and normal contraction of the puborectalis suggests the presence of external anal sphincter weakness. However, the accuracy of these components of the physical examination are highly dependent upon experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H897921729\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with diarrhea, we perform stool studies to determine the underlying etiology.

Anorectal manometry can measure parameters such as maximal resting anal pressure, amplitude and duration of squeeze pressure, the rectoanal inhibitory reflex, threshold of conscious rectal sensation, rectal compliance, and rectal and anal pressures during straining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Anal incontinence is defined as the involuntary loss of solid or liquid feces or flatus. Fecal urge incontinence is characterized by the desire to defecate, but incontinence occurs despite efforts to retain stool. Passive fecal incontinence is characterized by the lack of awareness of the need to defecate before the incontinent episode. (See <a href=\"#H972308870\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continence depends upon a number of factors including cognitive function, stool volume and consistency, colonic transit, rectal distensibility, anal sphincter function, anorectal sensation, and anorectal reflexes. Within the anorectum, anatomic barriers that help preserve continence include the rectum, the internal anal sphincter, external anal sphincter, and puborectalis muscle. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Physiology of defecation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of continence can result from dysfunction of the anal sphincters, abnormal rectal compliance, decreased rectal sensation, or a combination of any of these abnormalities. Incontinence is usually multifactorial, since these derangements often coexist. Mild impairment of any one mechanism will usually not cause incontinence, since the other mechanisms for maintaining continence can usually compensate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74995 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial evaluation in a patient with fecal incontinence consists of a focused history, physical examination, and endoscopic evaluation to rule out colonic inflammation or neoplasia. In patients with diarrhea, we perform laboratory studies to determine the underlying etiology. (See <a href=\"#H1148369122\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1148369178\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-chronic-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who fail to respond to conservative measures, we perform anorectal manometry and endorectal <span class=\"nowrap\">ultrasound/magnetic</span> resonance imaging.
