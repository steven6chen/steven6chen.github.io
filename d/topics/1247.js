A population-based survey in the United States conducted between 1999 and 2002 estimated that an abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was present in 8.9 percent of respondents. Although the term &quot;liver function tests&quot; (LFTs) is used commonly, it is imprecise and potentially misleading since many of the tests reflecting the health of the liver are not direct measures of its function. Furthermore, the commonly used liver biochemical tests may be abnormal even in patients with a healthy liver. </p><p>This topic review will provide an overview on the evaluation of patients with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests. Our approach is largely consistent with the 2017 American College of Gastroenterology clinical guidelines on evaluation of abnormal liver biochemistries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

A population-based study from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey examined patients with known hepatitis C virus infection (n = 259) and compared them with patients at low risk of liver injury (n = 3747) to determine optimal cutoff values for ALT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] &#160; The optimal cutoff for men was an ALT of 29 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> and for women was an ALT of 22 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-biochemical-tests-that-detect-injury-to-hepatocytes#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver biochemical tests that detect injury to hepatocytes&quot;, section on 'Serum aminotransferases'</a>.)</p><p>AST is present in the liver and other organs including cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain. ALT is present primarily in the liver, and thus is a more specific marker of hepatocellular cell injury. ALT levels correlate with the degree of abdominal adiposity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and at least two large studies have suggested that the cutoff values should be adjusted for gender and body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. However, most patients identified using the lower cutoff values have only mild liver disease or no identifiable cause of the abnormal laboratory values. Thus, the overall benefit of the proposed modifications is unclear since it would translate into a large increase in the absolute number of patients who would require evaluation for an uncertain clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79681530\"><span class=\"h3\">Alkaline phosphatase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum alkaline phosphatase is derived predominantly from the liver and bones. An elevated alkaline phosphatase can be fractionated to determine if it originates from the liver or bones, although in practice a liver source is usually confirmed by the simultaneous elevation of other measures of cholestasis (eg, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase). (See <a href=\"#H173607816\" class=\"local\">'Confirming an elevated alkaline phosphatase is of hepatic origin'</a> below.)</p><p>Other sources may also contribute to serum levels of alkaline phosphatase. Women in the third trimester of pregnancy, for example, have elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels due to an influx into blood of placental alkaline phosphatase. Individuals with blood types O and B can have elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels after eating a fatty meal due to an influx of intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Infants and toddlers occasionally display transient marked elevations of alkaline phosphatase in the absence of detectable bone or liver disease. Alkaline phosphatase elevations have been noted in patients with diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There are also reports of a benign familial occurrence of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase due to intestinal alkaline phosphatase. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enzymatic measures of cholestasis (eg, alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase)&quot;, section on 'Alkaline phosphatase'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transient-hyperphosphatasemia-of-infancy-and-early-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transient hyperphosphatasemia of infancy and early childhood&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Alkaline phosphatase levels also vary with age. Alkaline phosphatase levels are generally higher in children and adolescents because of physiologic osteoblastic activity. Levels may be up to three times higher than in healthy adults, with maximum levels in infancy and adolescence, coinciding with periods of maximum bone growth velocity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56695\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56695 \">figure 1</a>). Also, the normal serum alkaline phosphatase level gradually increases from age 40 to 65 years, particularly in women. The normal alkaline phosphatase level for an otherwise healthy 65-year-old woman is more than 50 percent higher than that for a healthy 30-year-old woman.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79681550\"><span class=\"h3\">Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GGT is found in hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, as well as in the kidney, seminal vesicles, pancreas, spleen, heart, and brain. In normal full-term neonates, serum GGT activity is six to seven times the upper limit of the adult reference range; levels decline and reach adult levels by five to seven months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Although its physiologic function is unknown, 5'-nucleotidase specifically catalyzes hydrolysis of nucleotides such as adenosine 5'-phosphate and inosine 5'-phosphate, in which the phosphate is attached to the 5 position of the pentose moiety. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enzymatic measures of cholestasis (eg, alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase)&quot;, section on '5'-Nucleotidase'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58137036\"><span class=\"h3\">Lactate dehydrogenase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is sometimes obtained when liver biochemical tests are being checked. LDH is a cytoplasmic enzyme present in tissues throughout the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F98392\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98392 \">table 1</a>). Five isoenzyme forms of LDH are present in serum and can be separated by various electrophoretic techniques.

This test is not as sensitive as the serum aminotransferases in liver disease and has poor diagnostic specificity, even when isoenzyme analysis is used. It is more useful as a marker of hemolysis.

Several definitions have been proposed for what constitutes significant alcohol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

A standard drink (360 mL [12 oz] of beer, 150 mL [5 oz] of wine, or 45 mL [1.5 oz] of 80-proof spirits) contains approximately 14 grams of alcohol.

Drug use is not limited to prescription medications, but also includes over-the-counter medications, herbal and dietary supplements, and illicit drug use. Features that suggest drug toxicity include lack of illness prior to ingesting the drug, clinical illness or biochemical abnormalities developing after beginning the drug, and improvement after the drug is withdrawn. If an immunologic reaction is suspected, the illness will generally recur upon reintroduction of the offending substance. However, rechallenge is not advised.

Hepatitis B and C are transmitted parenterally, whereas hepatitis A and E are transmitted from person to person via a fecal-oral route (often via contaminated food). Hepatitis E is uncommon in the United States, but it should be considered in patients who live in or have travelled to Asia, Africa, the Middle East, or Central America, and has been seen increasingly in Europe as a result of consumption of contaminated swine and game meat.

Common hepatocellular diseases associated with an elevated bilirubin and jaundice include viral and toxic hepatitis (including drugs, herbal therapies, and alcohol) and end-stage cirrhosis from any cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77337\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77337 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>If both the serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase are elevated, the LFT abnormalities are characterized by the predominant abnormality (eg, if the serum aminotransferases are 10 times the upper limit of normal and the alkaline phosphatase is twice the upper limit of normal, the LFT abnormalities would be characterized as primarily hepatocellular). However, making this distinction is not always possible. The degree of aminotransferase elevation can occasionally help in differentiating between hepatocellular and cholestatic processes. While ALT and AST values less than eight times the upper limit of normal may be seen in either hepatocellular or cholestatic liver disease, values 25 times the upper limit of normal or higher are seen primarily in hepatocellular diseases.</p><p>Abnormal tests of synthetic function may be seen with both hepatocellular injury and cholestasis. A low albumin suggests a chronic process, such as cirrhosis or cancer, while a normal albumin suggests a more acute process, such as viral hepatitis or choledocholithiasis. A prolonged prothrombin time indicates either vitamin K deficiency due to prolonged jaundice and intestinal malabsorption of vitamin K or significant hepatocellular dysfunction. The failure of the prothrombin time to correct with parenteral administration of vitamin K suggests severe hepatocellular injury.

In patients with cholestasis, the alkaline phosphatase is typically elevated to at least four times the upper limit of normal. The magnitude of the serum alkaline phosphatase elevation does not distinguish extrahepatic cholestasis from intrahepatic cholestasis. Lesser degrees of elevation are nonspecific and may be seen in many other types of liver disease, such as viral hepatitis, infiltrative diseases of the liver, and congestive hepatopathy. The gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) may also be elevated in the setting of cholestasis. However, elevated levels of serum GGT have been reported in a wide variety of other conditions. Patients with a predominantly cholestatic pattern typically undergo a right upper quadrant ultrasound to further characterize the cholestasis as intrahepatic or extrahepatic; the latter is suggested by biliary tract dilatation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173607816\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirming an elevated alkaline phosphatase is of hepatic origin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a patient has an isolated elevation of the alkaline phosphatase, the first step in the evaluation is to confirm it is of hepatic origin, since alkaline phosphatase can come from other sources, such as bone and placenta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78223\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78223 \">algorithm 1</a>). If, however, there are abnormalities in other liver chemistries or markers of hepatic function, particularly an elevated bilirubin, confirmation is typically not required. </p><p>To confirm that an isolated elevation in the alkaline phosphatase is coming from the liver, a GGT level or serum 5'-nucleotidase level should be obtained. These tests are usually elevated in parallel with the alkaline phosphatase in liver disorders but are not increased in bone disorders. An elevated serum alkaline phosphatase with a normal GGT or 5'-nucleotidase should prompt an evaluation for bone diseases. </p><p>An elevated bone alkaline phosphatase is indicative of high bone turnover, which may be caused by several disorders including healing fractures, osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Paget disease of bone, osteogenic sarcoma, and bone metastases.

(See <a href=\"#H19402151\" class=\"local\">'Common liver biochemical and function tests'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of a patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests includes obtaining a history to identify potential risk factors for liver disease and performing a physical examination to look for clues to the etiology and for signs of chronic liver disease. Subsequent testing is determined based on the information gathered from the history and physical examination as well as the pattern of liver test abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68475\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68475 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78223\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78223 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19404856\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver test abnormalities can often be grouped into one of several patterns: hepatocellular, cholestatic, or isolated hyperbilirubinemia. Patients with a hepatocellular process generally have a disproportionate elevation in the serum aminotransferases compared with the alkaline phosphatase, while those with a cholestatic process have the opposite findings. The serum bilirubin can be prominently elevated in both hepatocellular and cholestatic conditions and therefore is not necessarily helpful in differentiating between the two. Abnormal tests of synthetic function may be seen with both hepatocellular injury and cholestasis. (See <a href=\"#H19408712\" class=\"local\">'Patterns of liver test abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of hepatocyte damage, ALT and AST are released from hepatocytes, leading to increased serum levels. The differential diagnosis for elevated serum aminotransferases is broad and includes viral hepatitis, hepatotoxicity from drugs or toxins, alcoholic liver disease, hepatic ischemia, and malignant infiltration. The evaluation should take into account the patient's risk factors for liver disease as well as findings from the physical examination that may point to a particular diagnosis. The evaluation often involves testing for viral hepatitis and autoimmune disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68475\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68475 \">table 5</a>). Occasionally, a liver biopsy may be required. (See <a href=\"#H19404948\" class=\"local\">'Elevated serum aminotransferases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholestasis may develop in the setting of extrahepatic or intrahepatic biliary obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F99099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99099 \">table 6</a>). In patients with cholestasis, the alkaline phosphatase is typically elevated to at least four times the upper limit of normal. Lesser degrees of elevation are nonspecific and may be seen in many other types of liver disease, such as viral hepatitis, infiltrative diseases of the liver, and congestive hepatopathy. Patients with a predominantly cholestatic pattern typically undergo right upper quadrant ultrasonography to further characterize the cholestasis as intrahepatic or extrahepatic. (See <a href=\"#H19404964\" class=\"local\">'Elevated alkaline phosphatase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of biliary dilatation on ultrasonography suggests extrahepatic cholestasis which may be due to gallstones, strictures, or malignancy. The absence of biliary dilatation suggests intrahepatic cholestasis. There are numerous possible causes of intrahepatic cholestasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F99099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99099 \">table 6</a>), including drug toxicity, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, viral hepatitis, cholestasis of pregnancy, benign postoperative cholestasis, infiltrative diseases, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>. Subsequent testing to identify the underlying cause may include checking antimitochondrial antibodies, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasonography, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78223\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78223 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19405910\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of isolated hyperbilirubinemia begins with determining whether the hyperbilirubinemia is predominantly conjugated (direct hyperbilirubinemia) or unconjugated (indirect hyperbilirubinemia). An increase in unconjugated bilirubin in serum results from overproduction, impairment of uptake, or impaired conjugation of bilirubin. The evaluation of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia typically involves evaluation for hemolytic anemia as well as obtaining a history to determine if the patient has Gilbert syndrome. In a patient with a history consistent with Gilbert syndrome (eg, the development of jaundice during times of stress or fasting), normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels, and mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (&lt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> additional testing is not required. (See <a href=\"#H19404972\" class=\"local\">'Isolated hyperbilirubinemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19406639\" class=\"local\">'Unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An isolated elevation in conjugated bilirubin is found in two rare inherited conditions: Dubin-Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome, as well as other genetic bile transport disorders in children. Dubin-Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome should be suspected in patients with mild hyperbilirubinemia (with a direct-reacting fraction of approximately 50 percent) in the absence of other abnormalities of standard liver biochemical tests. Normal levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and GGT help to distinguish these conditions from disorders associated with biliary obstruction. Differentiating between these syndromes is possible but clinically unnecessary due to their benign nature. (See <a href=\"#H19406660\" class=\"local\">'Conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Pratt DS, Kaplan MM.
