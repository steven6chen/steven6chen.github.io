They occur both as sporadic tumors and as components of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2. They secrete calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), both of which can serve as tumor markers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary thyroid cancer: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The primary treatment for MTC is extensive and meticulous surgical resection. There is a limited role for external beam radiotherapy. Because the neuroendocrine-derived MTC is not responsive to either radioiodine or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression, these options are not available for treatment of progressive metastatic MTC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary thyroid cancer: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with progressive or symptomatic metastatic disease who cannot be treated by surgery or radiotherapy should be considered candidates for systemic therapy. New approaches based upon application of targeted chemotherapies are now available as effective interventions for progressive disease, with additional investigational options emerging. Alternatively, treatment with either cytotoxic chemotherapy or biologic response modifiers may provide some benefit for occasional patients who fail or are ineligible for targeted therapies.</p><p>Current and experimental chemotherapies for advanced medullary thyroid carcinomas will be reviewed here. Chemotherapies for differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-refractory-to-standard-treatment-chemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer refractory to standard treatment: Chemotherapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaplastic-thyroid-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaplastic thyroid cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in other tumors, tyrosine kinases function in MTC to stimulate tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Small molecule inhibitors of select tyrosine kinases have been of interest for the treatment of advanced MTC, given the oncogenic role of inherited and somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase <em>RET</em>, as well as the contributory roles of tyrosine kinases in growth factor receptors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These drugs partially inhibit multiple kinases at nanomolar concentrations and often affect multiple signaling pathways.

Other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remain investigational for the treatment of advanced MTC. In these trials, partial responses are reported in approximately 20 to 50 percent of patients. Although complete responses are rare, TKIs can potentially provide long-term disease stabilization. However, data on the ability of any of these agents to improve survival are limited.</p><p>For most patients with progressive advanced MTC, we suggest participation in clinical trials of therapies targeting the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of MTC. In patients who are unable to participate in clinical trials, we suggest an oral TKI, rather than a cytotoxic agent. As <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vandetanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vandetanib</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabozantinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabozantinib</a> have both been approved for use in the United States on the basis of randomized phase III trial results, we suggest either drug as an appropriate initial choice of TKI. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sorafenib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenvatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenvatinib</a> are alternative options.</p><p>In the studies described below, the definitions of tumor response are based upon the now-standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10576313\"><span class=\"h2\">Vandetanib</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vandetanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vandetanib</a> is an oral inhibitor that targets VEGFR, <em>RET</em>, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (<em>EGFR</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a phase II trial limited to patients with metastatic or unresectable hereditary MTC (either familial MTC or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A [MEN2A]), vandetanib, 300 mg daily, was administered to 30 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Confirmed partial response was observed in six (20 percent) patients, and another 16 (53 percent) patients had stable disease lasting at least 24 weeks.

Confirmed objective partial responses were reported in three patients (16 percent) and stable disease lasting at least 24 weeks in 10 patients (53 percent). Although the dose was lower, side effects were similar. During the trial, four patients with disease progression while taking the 100 mg dose received postprogression treatment with 300 mg.</p><p>An international, randomized phase III trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vandetanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vandetanib</a> (300 mg daily) was performed in over 300 patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic sporadic or hereditary MTC. After a median follow-up of 24 months, progression-free survival was significantly prolonged for patients randomly assigned to vandetanib versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.46, 95% CI 0.31-0.69) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The median progression-free survival had not yet been reached for the vandetanib group but was predicted to be 30.5 months compared with 19.3 months in the placebo group. The objective response rate was significantly higher in the vandetanib group (45 versus 13 percent). No difference has been observed in overall survival between the two treatment arms despite the improvement in progression-free survival, although the final survival analysis will be performed when sufficient number of deaths have occurred. Patients with both progressive and stable disease were eligible for enrollment, and outcomes were similar in the two groups. However, patients with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) doubling times greater than 24 months were unlikely to benefit from treatment. The presence of a somatic <em>RET</em> M918T mutation predicted an improved progression-free survival.</p><p>Common side effects occurring in &ge;20 percent of patients included <span class=\"nowrap\">diarrhea/colitis,</span> rash, dermatitis, nausea, hypertension, headache, fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain, hypocalcemia, decreased glucose, and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT).

Stable disease of at least six months duration was observed in 15 of 37 patients with MTC. The overall rate of partial responses and six-month, progression-free survival was 68 percent.

A significant prolongation in progression-free survival was observed for cabozantinib treatment compared with placebo (11.2 versus 4.0 months; HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.19-0.40). Partial responses were observed in 27 versus 0 percent. Median overall survival was nonsignificantly improved by 5.5 months with cabozantinib therapy (26.6 versus 21.1 months; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64-1.12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The most common side effects, occurring in &ge;25 percent of patients, were diarrhea, stomatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, hypertension, and abdominal pain. Although uncommon, clinically significant adverse events included fistula formation and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Significant electrocardiographic abnormalities were not observed. In a subsequent analysis, progression-free survival was markedly improved in the subset of patients treated with cabozantinib compared with placebo whose tumors contained <em>RET</em> M918T mutations (61 versus 17 weeks; HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.08-0.28), or whose tumors contained <em>RAS</em> mutations (47 versus 8 weeks; HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-1.10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although no improvement in progression-free survival was observed in patients whose tumors lacked either a <em>RET</em> or <em>RAS</em> mutation, the partial response in that cohort was 21 percent, indicating that there was still some degree of activity of the drug regardless of known mutation status.

One approach is to induce host immunity to the tumor by administering tumor-derived vaccines or inoculations of tumor-cell transfectants expressing specific cytokines. Another is to administer monoclonal antibodies coupled to radioisotopes to deliver radiotherapy. These therapies have been tried more often for patients with MTC than for other types of thyroid cancer. However, they remain investigational. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of cancer immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A novel approach to targeted immunotherapy is the use of tumor vaccines. Dendritic cells, which are derived from bone marrow antigen-presenting cells, are capable of presenting tumor-associated antigens, thereby generating cytotoxic T-cells targeting tumor cells.</p><p>In preliminary studies in patients with metastatic MTC, treatment with stimulated dendritic cells was promising, as illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, dendritic cells were obtained from each of seven patients and stimulated in the presence of both calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Following periodic intracutaneous injections of the stimulated dendritic cells, one patient experienced a partial response, including complete regression of hepatic metastases, which was associated with a 70 percent reduction in serum tumor markers. Two other patients had mixed responses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, dendritic cells were stimulated using lysates of each individual patient's surgically resected primary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Three of 10 patients had partial responses, including one with complete resolution of radiographic evidence of disease.</p><p/><p>Toxicities in both of these trials were minor, including low-grade fever and asymptomatic transient autoantibody development. Further small studies are underway, refining the procedures to enhance the potency of the dendritic cell vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Radioimmunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The expression of CEA on MTC cells led to the exploitation of radiolabeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies for radioimmunotherapy. In the initial trials, antitumor effects were noted using <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-CEA/anti-diethylenetriamine</span> pentaacetic acid (DTPA)-indium recombinant bispecific antibody (BsMAb), followed four days later by a 131I-labeled bivalent hapten [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In a subsequent nonrandomized trial in patients with progressive metastatic MTC (defined as a calcitonin doubling time less than two years), median overall survival after administration of this therapy was 110 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Although it may take many months before radiographic response becomes evident, targeting angiogenesis (and specifically vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR] signaling pathways) has produced the most impressive clinical responses to date in MTC. Complete responses are rare, but kinase inhibitors can potentially provide long-term disease stabilization and delay progression in selected patients. However, no study has yet reported these agents' effects to improve survival. In addition, eventual progression despite antiangiogenic VEGFR blockade has occurred during the treatment of other malignancies, suggesting emergence of alternate pathways to promote tumor growth and metastasis (including fibroblast growth factor receptor [FGFR], C-MET, and angiopoietins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>These newer &quot;targeted therapies&quot; have significant toxicities and, therefore, it is important to limit the use of systemic treatments to patients at significant risk for morbidity or mortality due to progressive metastatic disease. Patients treated with systemic agents should have a baseline performance status sufficiently functional to tolerate these interventions, such as being ambulatory at least 50 percent of the day (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status 2 or better).</p><p>In the absence of sufficient clinical trial data comparing both efficacy and safety of any individual drug or combination, the following treatment strategy is based upon clinical experience and data from open label studies.

Presently, no novel treatment has been demonstrated to improve survival for thyroid cancer patients. Toxicities of many of these new therapies, although probably less life-threatening than cytotoxic chemotherapies, are common and can be dose limiting, and clinicians must be familiar with recognizing and managing the side effects if they intend to use these agents. Finally, the low rate of partial response, the absence of complete responses, and emergence of resistance in all of the various monotherapy trials identify the need to develop either more effective single agents or to identify rational combinations of therapeutic targets (including cytotoxic chemotherapies) that have synergistic effectiveness without enhanced cross-toxicities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medullary thyroid cancers (MTCs) are neuroendocrine tumors of thyroid parafollicular cells that do not concentrate iodine.
