The time-honored tools available to the hematologist include the clinical bleeding history, the physical examination, and a few select laboratory tests. Despite advances in clinical laboratory medicine and the advent of entirely new technologies, little has changed in the tests that are utilized for the assessment of bleeding risk. They remain remarkably effective in providing the information needed to evaluate the risk of bleeding in the surgical setting. The challenge remains to make sure that all patients at risk receive the proper evaluation so that bleeding complications are avoided.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the general approach to the preoperative assessment of hemostasis. Guidance concerning specific problem areas is provided separately, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative medical evaluation of the healthy patient.

The approach outlined in his concise review remains valid today.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">The clinical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical history remains the cornerstone of the preoperative assessment. However, four reasons have been cited why the history alone may be insufficient, suggesting a role for laboratory testing in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;forgetful physician&quot; &ndash; Simply put, this is a surgeon (the physician) who does not take an adequate bleeding history and is then unable to make informed decisions regarding the need for testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;unreliable&quot; patient &ndash; A common example of the unreliable patient is one who states they have no prior surgical history but neglects to mention wisdom teeth extractions or tonsillectomy since they occurred during their childhood. Both procedures are quite common but often not mentioned because patients do not consider them to be surgical procedures. Both operations are true challenges to hemostasis, since the oral cavity is rich in fibrinolytic substances.<br/><br/>Alternatively, patients may recall these procedures but do not consider the bleeding they may have experienced as excessive. Having no basis for comparison, they may inadvertently overlook this complication. Other relevant items often overlooked include circumcision, childbirth and associated surgical procedures (eg, episiotomy), epistaxis, and the extent of menstrual blood losses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;unprovoked&quot; patient &ndash; A patient with an inherited bleeding disorder may not have experienced excessive bleeding in the past, especially if there has not been any prior surgery. In such patients the history will be uninformative unless there is a positive family history of bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;acquired disorder&quot; &ndash; Patients with an acquired bleeding disorder may have no history of excessive surgical bleeding because their hemostatic defect is relatively recent in onset (eg, acquired von Willebrand disease).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient questionnaires</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient questionnaires are a logical way to obtain a bleeding history. One of the pitfalls, however, is the tendency of patients to over-report bleeding tendencies, such as easy bruising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In such cases it can be quite difficult to rely solely on the history. The following is a questionnaire adapted and expanded from Dr. Rapaport's review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you experience excess bleeding in your mouth or frequent nosebleeds?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you bled into a muscle or a joint? Have you ever had blood in your stool?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have profuse menstrual bleeding?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you develop large bruises even in the absence of obvious injury? Have you bled excessively after small wounds?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you had teeth extracted? How long did you bleed? Was the bleeding immediate or delayed?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What operations have you undergone, including minor procedures such as skin biopsies or <span class=\"nowrap\">colonoscopy/bronchoscopy</span> with biopsies? Was there any bleeding, either immediate or delayed?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have other medical problems? Is there a history of hepatic, renal, or hematologic disease? Have you ever required a transfusion of whole blood, red blood cells, platelets, plasma, or blood clotting factors?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What medications are you taking? Do you take anticoagulant medications? Have you taken <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or other pain relievers within the last 10 days? Do you take over-the-counter remedies, supplements, or alternative medicine (eg, herbal preparations)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do any relatives have bleeding tendencies or experience excessive bleeding following surgery?</p><p/><p>After reviewing the history, the physician should then be able to decide whether further laboratory information is required. In some cases the history does not suggest an underlying bleeding problem. If the patient has not had a sufficient challenge to hemostasis (eg, no prior surgical procedures) then the history may be uninformative and additional testing may be required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">The physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of findings on the physical examination are suggestive of a potential bleeding disorder:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of petechiae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71480\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71480 \">picture 1</a>) or ecchymoses suggests thrombocytopenia or functionally deficient platelets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a bleeding diathesis&quot;, section on 'Disorders of platelets or blood vessels'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telangiectasias may reflect underlying liver disease (eg, spider angiomas, often present on the trunk or face) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74047\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74047 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) Alternatively, they may represent hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (characteristically present in the mouth and on the lips) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77416\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77416 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of past hemarthroses such as the presence of joint deformities in a patient with a positive bleeding history suggests severe factor deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;, section on 'Late complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematomas may also be due to factor deficiencies or inhibitors against a clotting factor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collagen-vascular disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can be associated with prolonged bleeding due to an impairment in the structure of the blood vessels; other than increased capillary fragility, hematologic studies are usually normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These patients have hyperelasticity of the skin and hyperextendable joints. Other disorders of blood vessel structure associated with clinical bleeding, which may have stigmata on physical examination, include scurvy and Cushing's syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65564\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65564 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY TESTING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17813752\"><span class=\"h2\">Coagulation testing and platelet count</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early literature concerning the issue of preoperative assessment of hemostasis suggested the use of the prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) prior to surgery in order to detect those patients at risk for bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;</a>.) </p><p>However, several retrospective studies suggest that routine laboratory testing is unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. If the history and physical examination do not suggest the presence of a bleeding disorder, no additional laboratory testing is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'The classic approach'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;, section on 'Tests of hemostasis'</a>.)</p><p>If the family history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical examination suggests the presence of a bleeding disorder, appropriate screening tests should be performed (ie, PT, aPTT, platelet count). Additional testing will likely be required to establish a diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a bleeding diathesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Medical and hematologic consultations'</a> below.) </p><p>Hemophilia carriers may have a normal aPTT but still have significantly reduced factor levels; such individuals should have activity levels of the relevant coagulation factor tested prior to an invasive procedure or surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;, section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>.)</p><p>This recommendation is consistent with the position of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and the American Society of Anesthesiologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It differs from the guidelines published by the Italian Society for Haemostasis and Thrombosis (SISET) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Despite acknowledging that all their recommendations are of grade D, they recommend that the PT, aPTT, and platelet count should be performed routinely before surgery or invasive procedures (except diagnostic endoscopies) even in the case of a negative history of bleeding.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study reviewed the records of 750 patients on a general surgery service and identified 139 (19 percent) patients whose history or physical exam suggested a bleeding tendency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Twenty-five (18 percent) of these patients had an abnormal PTT or PT; 480 of the 611 patients with a negative history and physical examination had a PTT or PT measured. Only 13 (2.7 percent) had an abnormal result. Four were found to have normal results on repeat testing and the other nine underwent surgery without further evaluation. Only one of these patients had a bleeding complication, due to a bleeding arterial vessel. Given that 2.28 percent of individuals in a healthy population would be expected to have a prolonged PTT or PT (ie, a value more than two standard deviations above the mean), the prevalence of abnormal results of 2.7 percent in this study could be explained by random variation alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study retrospectively reviewed 2000 patients admitted for elective surgery with a goal of identifying the frequency of unnecessary routine preoperative laboratory tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The majority (77 percent) of the <span class=\"nowrap\">PTT/PT</span> determinations were not indicated based on patient histories. However, there was no analysis of the bleeding complications in either group, so it is difficult to determine whether the testing was valuable even in the group with a history suggestive of increased bleeding risk. Preoperative platelet counts were abnormal in only 2 of 407 patients screened.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prospective studies have also been performed in asymptomatic patients undergoing major surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/10,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17-20</a>]. Bleeding time, platelet count, PT, and aPTT were measured in 111 patients on a general or thoracic surgery service [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Only one patient had mild thrombocytopenia and eight had a prolonged aPTT. None experienced excessive bleeding, although the eight patients with the prolonged aPTT were found to have neither factor deficiencies nor a lupus anticoagulant as the explanation for their elevated aPTT. The same authors looked at this issue from a different perspective. They identified 49 out of 1872 patients who required perioperative red cell transfusion volumes that were larger than usual for the performed procedure. None of these patients had abnormal test results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One prospective study was quite comprehensive, evaluating the PT, aPTT, platelet count, and bleeding time in a multicenter study of 3242 consecutive patients undergoing general surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. After screening patients by clinical history for increased bleeding risk, only one of 340 (0.3 percent) with a normal history but abnormal tests required treatment to correct the abnormality. In contrast, 26 of 172 (15 percent) with an abnormal history and abnormal tests required treatment. Overall surgical mortality was higher if patients had abnormal screening tests, but this was likely due to the greater severity of their underlying disease, since there was no difference in perioperative bleeding mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mortality was significantly less in the 1951 patients with a normal history and normal tests compared with the 340 patients with a normal history but abnormal tests (0.87 percent versus 2.06 percent). The same was true when comparing the 779 patients with an abnormal history but normal tests with the 172 patients with an abnormal history and abnormal screening tests (2.18 percent versus 6.39 percent). These results suggest that laboratory screening is not necessary in patients undergoing general surgery unless the clinical history suggests a bleeding problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another prospective study looked at the impact of omitting preoperative laboratory testing in 3866 patients undergoing 3849 operations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Following a protocol based on the patient's clinical status and type of surgery, the PT, aPTT, platelet count, and bleeding time were not ordered in 76 percent, 75 percent, 92 percent and 99 percent of patients, respectively, without any adverse effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study evaluated the benefit of preoperative laboratory testing in predicting postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Five hundred twenty patients undergoing elective general surgery were followed for perioperative complications. Measurement of the platelet count, PT, and aPTT were of no predictive value in this regard.</p><p/><p>One could argue that the majority of general surgical procedures are not associated with a high risk of bleeding and that the prevalence of bleeding disorders is low. Therefore, studies measuring perioperative morbidity and mortality due to bleeding would require huge numbers of patients. In addition, the majority of patients with bleeding disorders will be identified by the clinical history, calling into question the value of laboratory screening of asymptomatic individuals prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/9,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, the bleeding time (BT) has been widely used to predict surgical bleeding. Although it is a good test of platelet function, it is not necessarily a good screening test to predict bleeding risk. One review reported on 13 studies involving the bleeding time as a screening test; all except two were prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Seven studies involved cardiac surgery patients; the remainder included a variety of surgical patients. There was no correlation between the BT and surgical bleeding, whether assessed by chest tube drainage post cardiopulmonary bypass, transfusion requirement, or intraoperative blood loss. The authors pointed out that the skin bleeding time does not necessarily correlate with bleeding at other anatomical sites.</p><p>A normal BT does not predict the safety of surgical procedures, nor does an abnormal BT predict excessive bleeding. As an example, a retrospective study found a 5 percent positive predictive value of the BT and a 95 percent negative predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a bleeding diathesis&quot;, section on 'Bleeding time'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC SURGICAL PROCEDURES AND THEIR BLEEDING RISKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are specific surgical procedures for which information is available concerning the value of preoperative laboratory screening. These common procedures include coronary bypass surgery, tonsillectomy, prostate surgery, and gynecologic oncology surgery. Because these patient populations are thought to have greater bleeding risk, more attention has been focused on the use of preoperative screening in these settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary artery bypass surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A study of 897 consecutive adult cardiac surgical patients failed to demonstrate an association between post-operative bleeding as assessed by 16-hour mediastinal drainage and numerous laboratory tests of hemostasis, including the aPTT, PT, platelet count, activated clotting time, bleeding time, fibrinogen, and <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrin/fibrinogen</span> degradation products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The first five tests were obtained preoperatively and all were measured post-bypass after adequate heparin neutralization was documented. Although there was a statistically significant relationship between some of these variables and the amount of bleeding, there was broad scatter, making the predictive value of an individual test negligible. This was true even for patients with excessive post-bypass bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Tonsillectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two prospective studies used preoperative screening for coagulation disorders in children undergoing tonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The first measured the complete blood count, PT, aPTT, and BT in 1603 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. If an abnormality was found, the test was repeated one week later and if persistent abnormalities were found, further studies were undertaken. The 129 patients who reported prior perioperative bleeding or had laboratory abnormalities were assessed more thoroughly for a bleeding history with a standard questionnaire.</p><p>Fourteen patients (11 percent) had a positive bleeding history. Fifteen patients had persistent laboratory abnormalities, including five with a lupus inhibitor, six with a non-lupus inhibitor, one with mild hemophilia A, one with von Willebrand disease, and two with prolonged aPTT of undetermined cause. These patients all received therapy to correct their hemostatic abnormality prior to surgery. Although history and screening tests had a high degree of specificity (0.86 and 0.99, respectively), in the final analysis they were insensitive (0.03 for both). The poor sensitivity and low prevalence of bleeding (2.3 percent) led to a very low positive predictive value (0.07) in predicting postoperative bleeding.</p><p>The second study looked only at the predictive value of the bleeding history and measurement of the aPTT and PT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Six of 96 patients had positive histories with possible von Willebrand disease in one patient, a lupus inhibitor in two, and normal laboratory tests in three. Fourteen of 90 patients (16 percent) with negative histories had prolongation of the aPTT, but only one had possible von Willebrand disease and did not bleed following surgery. None of the patients with positive questionnaires or prolonged aPTT bled after surgery; even histories suggestive of a mild bleeding disorder were not accurate in predicting postoperative bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Gynecologic surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although elective gynecologic surgery is not associated with a high risk of bleeding, patients undergoing gynecologic surgery for malignancies may be at higher risk. A retrospective study looked at 351 patients on the gynecologic oncology service undergoing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Twelve (3.4 percent) had prolonged PT or aPTT, while 57 of 322 patients (18 percent) had elevation of fibrinogen and positive D-dimer. Of 322 patients, 188 had at least one abnormal test result. However, there were no perioperative deaths or re-explorations due to bleeding and only one post-operative hematoma, leading the authors to conclude that routine preoperative testing for coagulopathy was of little use clinically, despite the high prevalence of these abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Prostate surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery of the prostate, for both benign and malignant disease is well known to be associated with a risk of significant bleeding as the urogenital system is rich in urokinase. Not only local fibrinolytic reactions, but also disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been associated with prostate surgery. Hence, there has been long-standing interest in the role of preoperative hematologic screening tests. One study measured the preoperative PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, and platelet count in 165 consecutive patients undergoing prostate surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) was present in 116 patients, adenocarcinoma in 45 patients, and both diagnoses in four patients. Two patients had thrombocytopenia with bone marrow examination showing metastatic disease; studies for the presence of DIC were normal and these two patients had uneventful prostatic biopsies. One patient with normal preoperative values developed DIC after biopsy, while three patients with BPH had normal screening tests but experienced bleeding due to local fibrinolysis. It could be concluded that the hematologic screening tests were not helpful in predicting bleeding complications, either due to faulty surgical hemostasis or hematologic problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A recommended approach, balancing the information from the bleeding history, the physical examination, the inherent bleeding risk of the planned surgery, and the appropriate laboratory tests of hemostasis is found below. Each patient should be considered on an individual basis, with a strong emphasis on the clinical history and physical examination, as well as the risk of bleeding from a particular surgical procedure, before deciding whether <strong>any</strong> preoperative laboratory screening for coagulation disorders is necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the history and physical examination do not suggest the presence of a bleeding disorder, no additional laboratory testing is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'The classic approach'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;, section on 'Tests of hemostasis'</a>.)</p><p>If the patient or family history or physical examination suggests the presence of a bleeding disorder, appropriate screening tests should be performed, including prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and platelet count. Additional testing will likely be required to establish a diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a bleeding diathesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Medical and hematologic consultations'</a> below.) </p><p>Of note, a normal bleeding time (BT) does not predict the safety of surgical procedures, nor does an abnormal BT predict for excessive bleeding; therefore the use of the BT in routine preoperative screening does not appear to be warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical and hematologic consultations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The situation is different if the surgeon has requested a medical or hematologic consultation to assess the possibility of bleeding, especially if the history and physical examination strongly suggest the presence of a bleeding disorder. Such situations are no longer &quot;routine&quot;, and require a greater degree of individualized attention. Under these circumstances, we recommend the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the history and physical examination is not suggestive of the presence of a bleeding disorder, the following laboratory tests should be obtained: liver function studies, creatinine, complete blood count with white blood cell differential, platelet count, review of the peripheral blood smear, PT, and aPTT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical examination is suggestive of a bleeding disorder, additional tests should be ordered based on the nature of the bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79969 \">table 2</a>) or known family history. At a minimum, this should include all of the tests listed immediately above. Other tests, such as specific factor assays, platelet function studies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an evaluation for von Willebrand disease should be guided by clinical judgment.
