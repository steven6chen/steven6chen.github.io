It is useful to classify polyneuropathies into two general categories based on pathophysiology: axonal and demyelinating. Axonal neuropathies cause symptoms and signs related to axon loss, while demyelinating neuropathies produce abnormalities based on the lack of appropriate interaction of Schwann cells with axons. The distinction between axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathies is clinically important because it guides the differential diagnosis, and ultimately the approach to treatment. Axonal neuropathies may be caused by a broad spectrum of systemic illnesses. The differential diagnosis of demyelinating neuropathies includes immune-mediated, toxic, and hereditary etiologies. In this article we specifically address the immune-mediated polyneuropathies, with emphasis on the demyelinating neuropathies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114996793\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immune-mediated neuropathies can be divided into acute and chronic forms.</p><p>The acute immune-mediated polyneuropathies are classified under the eponym Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS), a heterogeneous condition with several variant forms (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>).

While there is no established consensus regarding the classification of all these neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-mediated-neuropathies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], there is a general sense that multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), the POEMS syndrome (osteosclerotic myeloma: polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, skin changes), and the anti-myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG)-related neuropathies are distinct from classic CIDP on the basis of clinical, electrodiagnostic, and therapeutic differences.</p><p>Neuropathies with a likely or possible immune mediated mechanism may present with one of the following clinical phenotypes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic, idiopathic CIDP</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM) or Lewis-Sumner syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic immune sensory polyradiculopathy (CISP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory-predominant CIDP</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal acquired demyelinating symmetric (DADS) neuropathy </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demyelinating neuropathy with central nervous system demyelination </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gait ataxia with late onset polyneuropathy (GALOP) syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic ataxic neuropathy with ophthalmoplegia, IgM paraprotein, cold agglutinins, and disialosyl antibodies (CANOMAD) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multifocal motor neuropathy</p><p/><p>The following systemic disorders may be associated with one or more of the above clinical phenotypes, as discussed in subsequent sections:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple myeloma </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed cryoglobulinemia </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic disorders (eg, diabetes mellitus, lupus, systemic vasculitides, thyrotoxicosis, neoplasm)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114998226\"><span class=\"h1\">GUILLAIN-BARR&Eacute; SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) is an acute monophasic illness. It is thought to result from an immune response to a preceding infection that cross-reacts with peripheral nerve components because of molecular mimicry. The immune response can be directed towards the myelin or the axon of peripheral nerve, resulting in demyelinating and axonal forms of GBS. Campylobacter jejuni infection is the most commonly identified precipitant of GBS. Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have also been associated with GBS. A small percentage of patients develop GBS after another triggering event such as immunization, surgery, trauma, and bone-marrow transplantation.</p><p>The cardinal clinical features of GBS are progressive, mostly symmetric muscle weakness and absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes. The weakness can vary from mild to severe, with nearly complete paralysis of all extremity, facial, respiratory, and bulbar muscles. Severe respiratory muscle weakness necessitating ventilatory support develops in about 30 percent, and dysautonomia occurs in 70 percent of patients. GBS usually progresses over a period of about two weeks.</p><p>GBS is a heterogeneous syndrome with several variant forms. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common variant of GBS in North America, Europe, and most of the developed world. The Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a GBS variant characterized by ophthalmoplegia with ataxia and areflexia. Axonal forms of GBS include acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), most common in Japan and China, and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN).</p><p>The initial diagnosis of GBS is based upon the clinical presentation. The diagnosis is confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and clinical neurophysiology studies. An increased CSF protein with a normal CSF white blood cell count, called albuminocytologic dissociation, is found in 50 to 66 percent of patients with GBS in the first week after the onset of symptoms and in &ge;75 percent of patients in the third week. Electrodiagnostic studies show evidence of acute polyneuropathy with either predominantly demyelinating (ie, AIDP) or axonal (ie, AMAN or AMSAN) features. Testing for serum IgG antibodies to GQ1b is useful for the diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome.</p><p>Supportive care is extremely important in GBS since about 30 percent of patients develop neuromuscular respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in children: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>). In addition, severe autonomic dysfunction occurs in about 20 percent and warrants intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring. The main modalities of therapy for GBS are plasma exchange and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>. The treatments are equivalent and improve outcome. Even with treatment, approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients have a prolonged course with very delayed and incomplete recovery, and 5 percent die despite intensive care. In addition, about 2 percent of patients with GBS will develop the chronic relapsing weakness of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114997688\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately.

Weakness is present in both proximal and distal muscles. Most patients also have sensory involvement and globally diminished or absent reflexes. Sensory impairment in CIDP is usually greater for vibration and position sense than for pain and temperature sense. Cranial nerve and bulbar involvement occur in a minority. Most patients have a slowly progressive course, but a relapsing-remitting course is noted in at least one-third.

Multifocal motor neuropathy is a rare condition characterized by progressive asymmetric weakness and atrophy without sensory abnormalities, a presentation similar to that of motor neuron disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28903565\"><span class=\"h2\">Multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM), also known as Lewis-Sumner syndrome, is considered a variant of CIDP because of its asymmetric, multifocal distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-mediated-neuropathies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The clinical presentation of MADSAM is indistinguishable from other forms of mononeuropathy multiplex, with sensory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> motor symptoms in individual nerve distributions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-mediated-neuropathies/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Some authors have reported a predilection for the arms. Following the initial description of MADSAM in 1982, there was some confusion separating this syndrome from multifocal motor neuropathy (see <a href=\"#H28903586\" class=\"local\">'Multifocal motor neuropathy'</a> below), which also presents with multifocal motor symptoms, but without objective sensory involvement. It is now generally accepted that MADSAM is more closely related to CIDP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-mediated-neuropathies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Except for the multifocal pattern, MADSAM is otherwise similar to CIDP in its laboratory profile and response to treatment (eg, elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein level and response to intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, glucocorticoids, and plasma exchange). Other laboratory tests are usually normal, although cases associated with elevated IgG anti-gangliosides have been described. Nerve conduction studies show multifocal demyelination in both motor and sensory studies.

Neurologic examination confirms the absence of significant motor abnormalities. As in typical CIDP, diagnostic evaluation reveals elevated CSF protein and evidence of demyelination on nerve conduction studies. Both sensory and motor studies are typically abnormal, despite the absence of motor signs or symptoms. In some cases peripheral nerve conduction studies are normal, but somatosensory evoked potentials are abnormal and CSF protein is elevated, suggesting involvement of the sensory nerve root. Sensory predominant CIDP is treated in the same manner as typical CIDP.

The POEMS syndrome is reviewed here briefly and described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poems-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;POEMS syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations of POEMS syndrome are protean. By definition, all patients have peripheral neuropathy and a monoclonal plasma cell disorder; the monoclonal protein light chain is almost always of the lambda type, while the associated heavy chain is usually IgG or IgA, and rarely IgM. Nearly all patients have either osteosclerotic myeloma (solitary or multiple) or Castleman disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia). The prevalence of other manifestations (eg, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, skin changes, edema, and papilledema) varies greatly. Additional findings associated with POEMS include peripheral edema, ascites, polycythemia, and fatigue. Elevation of serum or plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels is an important feature. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poems-syndrome#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;POEMS syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Peripheral neuropathy usually dominates the clinical picture in POEMS. Symptoms begin in the feet and consist of tingling, paresthesias, and feelings of coldness. Motor involvement follows the sensory symptoms. Both are distal, symmetric, and progressive, with a gradual proximal spread. Severe weakness occurs in more than one-half of patients. The course is progressive and patients may be confined to a wheelchair. Autonomic symptoms are not a feature. Physical examination reveals a symmetric sensorimotor neuropathy involving the extremities. Muscle weakness is more marked than sensory loss. Touch, pressure, vibratory, and joint position senses are often involved. Less frequently, loss of temperature discrimination and nociception occurs. Cranial nerves are not affected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poems-syndrome#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;POEMS syndrome&quot;, section on 'Peripheral neuropathy'</a>.)</p><p>Cerebrospinal fluid protein levels are increased in virtually all patients, usually &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> while the total cell count is typically normal. Electrodiagnostic studies show slowing of nerve conduction, prolonged distal latencies, and severe attenuation of compound muscle action potentials. Conduction block is rarely found, but slowing of motor conduction is proportionately greater than the reduction in the compound muscle action potential amplitude. Distal fibrillation potentials are found on needle electromyography. Biopsy of the sural nerve usually shows both axonal degeneration and demyelination; severe endoneurial edema may also be seen. A loss of myelinated fibers and an increased frequency of axonal degeneration in teased fibers have been reported, along with high expression of VEGF in vasa nervorum and some non-myelin- forming Schwann cells. Endoneurial deposits of immunoglobulins of the same type as in the serum have been reported in three of four patients with POEMS syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poems-syndrome#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;POEMS syndrome&quot;, section on 'Peripheral neuropathy'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of POEMS syndrome requires the presence of at least three major criteria (ie, polyneuropathy plus monoclonal plasma cell disorder plus any one of the following three: osteosclerotic bone lesion(s), Castleman disease, or elevated serum or plasma VEGF levels), along with the presence of at least one of the six minor criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64782 \">table 3</a>). The absence of either osteosclerotic myeloma or Castleman disease should make the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome suspect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poems-syndrome#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;POEMS syndrome&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>There is no standard treatment for POEMS syndrome. In general, the mode of therapy is based upon whether the patient has limited or widespread sclerotic bone lesions, with radiation therapy employed for those with limited disease, and chemotherapy similar to multiple myeloma for those with widespread bone lesions. Hematopoietic cell transplantation is an option for patients with rapidly progressive neuropathy and for younger patients with widespread osteosclerotic lesions.

The response to plasma exchange is inconsistent, possibly because IgM is replaced within five days so that plasma exchange does not have a long-lasting effect. The nerve conduction findings are also different from classic CIDP, with distal accentuated slowing being the hallmark of IgM neuropathy. The pathology appears to differ from classic CIDP, with widening of myelin sheaths seen in reports of anti-MAG IgM neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-mediated-neuropathies/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81517498\"><span class=\"h3\">Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere.

The neuropathy is often demyelinating, with sensory involvement more common than motor involvement, but may be purely motor. The most frequent neurologic abnormality is a distal, symmetric, and slowly progressive sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy causing pain, paresthesia, and weakness. The lower extremities are usually more involved than the upper extremities. Additional but less common neurologic manifestations of Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia include cranial nerve palsies, mononeuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, multifocal motor neuropathy or motor neuron-like syndromes, multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and sudden deafness. Anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) activity is found in about one-half of patients with Waldenstr&ouml;m-associated neuropathy, but there is no correlation between these antibodies and the severity of symptoms. Other autoantibodies of uncertain pathogenetic significance have also been described, including those directed against GM1 ganglioside and asialo-GM1 ganglioside.

However, it is impossible to determine whether the presence of IgM in the biopsy specimen is a causative factor or whether it represents passive deposition of IgM in an already damaged nerve. Amyloid deposition in the nerve may be responsible for the sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy in some patients. Amyloid may be investigated using Congo red staining of a subcutaneous fat pad aspirate or bone marrow biopsy.

(See <a href=\"#H114996793\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) is an acute monophasic illness with several variant forms. The cardinal clinical features of GBS are progressive, mostly symmetric muscle weakness and absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes. The weakness can vary from mild to severe, with nearly complete paralysis of all extremity, facial, respiratory, and bulbar muscles. GBS usually progresses over a period of about two weeks. (See <a href=\"#H114998226\" class=\"local\">'Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic form of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is fairly symmetric; motor involvement is greater than sensory. Weakness is present in both proximal and distal muscles. Most patients also have globally diminished or absent reflexes. There is evidence of peripheral nerve demyelination by either electrodiagnostic testing or by nerve biopsy. The course is most often slowly progressive, but can be relapsing-remitting. The primary therapies for CIDP are intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, glucocorticoids, and plasma exchange. (See <a href=\"#H114997688\" class=\"local\">'Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical variants of CIDP include multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM), also known as Lewis-Sumner syndrome, sensory-predominant CIDP, distal acquired demyelinating symmetric (DADS) neuropathy, demyelinating neuropathy with central nervous system demyelination, and gait ataxia with late onset polyneuropathy (GALOP) syndrome. Multifocal motor neuropathy is a rare condition characterized by progressive asymmetric weakness and atrophy without sensory abnormalities, a presentation similar to that of motor neuron disease. (See <a href=\"#H28903557\" class=\"local\">'CIDP variants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monoclonal gammopathies may occur in association with malignancies (eg, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia) with or without evidence of peripheral neuropathy. Monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS) can be associated with peripheral neuropathy, but it is often not clear whether the neuropathy is etiologically related to the gammopathy or merely represents a coincidental association. In patients with neuropathy, the most common monoclonal protein is of the IgM class followed by IgG and IgA. With the exception of POEMS syndrome, there is no evidence that the demyelinating neuropathy in patients with an IgG or IgA paraprotein is distinct from CIDP without a paraprotein. The demyelinating neuropathy is otherwise indistinguishable from CIDP and shows a similar response to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H422772461\" class=\"local\">'Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H422772693\" class=\"local\">'POEMS syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropathies associated with IgM gammopathy include distal acquired demyelinating symmetric (DADS) neuropathy with IgM paraprotein, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) gammopathy, mixed cryoglobulinemia, and gait ataxia with late onset polyneuropathy (GALOP) syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H213230145\" class=\"local\">'Neuropathy with IgM gammopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and median neuropathy at the carpal tunnel are the most common types of neuropathy associated with AL amyloidosis.
