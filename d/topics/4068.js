Patients may present at any age, but there is a peak incidence in the second and third decades of life. There is approximately a 2:1 male-to-female predominance in North American and Western European populations, although the sexes are equally affected among populations in East Asia.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, and diagnosis of IgA nephropathy will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis of this disorder are discussed separately.

In a Chinese study of 13,519 renal biopsies, for example, IgA nephropathy constituted 45 percent of all cases of primary glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>However, IgA deposits may also be seen on kidney biopsies of individuals with no evidence of kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The reported incidence of mesangial IgA deposition in apparently healthy individuals ranges from 3 to 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. These cases had no clinical features of nephritis but their renal biopsy was consistent with IgA nephropathy.</p><p>This observation raises three important points:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a large cohort of undiagnosed &quot;latent&quot; IgA nephropathy in the general population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This finding must be considered when genetic studies are undertaken comparing gene polymorphisms in IgA nephropathy with normal &quot;healthy&quot; populations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It raises an important consideration for the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy: The process of mesangial IgA deposition may be separate from the induction of glomerular injury, and IgA deposition does not necessarily need to be followed by nephritis. Identifying the independent factors that may be critical to each of these processes may improve our overall understanding of the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy.</p><p/><p>There are also a number of reports documenting IgA deposition in other forms of glomerulonephritis. These particularly include thin basement membrane nephropathy, lupus nephritis, minimal change disease, diabetic nephropathy, and IgA-dominant <em>Staphylococcus</em>-associated postinfectious glomerulonephritis. With the exception of IgA-dominant postinfectious <em>Staphylococcus</em>-associated glomerulonephritis, these findings are most probably due to chance associations because IgA deposition is common in the general population.</p><p>Variations in disease prevalence may reflect regional differences in screening for kidney disease and kidney biopsy practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Many patients with IgA nephropathy are detected on routine urine screening because their only clinical manifestation is asymptomatic hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria. Prevalence may therefore appear to be higher in countries with an active urine testing program and a low threshold for the performance of renal biopsy in patients with isolated asymptomatic hematuria, such as Japan and Korea, where testing is routinely performed in schools and in the workplace. Conversely, clinicians in North America seldom biopsy a patient with isolated hematuria or mild proteinuria, resulting in an apparently lower disease prevalence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of IgA nephropathy is established only by kidney biopsy. The pathognomonic finding is observed on immunofluorescence microscopy, which demonstrates dominant or codominant mesangial deposits of IgA, either alone, with IgG, with IgM, or with both IgG and IgM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69895\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69895 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58102\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58102 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Deposited IgA is predominantly J chain-containing polymeric IgA1, with a predominance for lambda light chains. Subendothelial capillary wall IgA deposits may also be present in up to one-third of patients, and this is associated with higher histologic activity (increased mesangial and endocapillary hypercellularity) and worse renal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. IgG codeposition is observed in approximately one-third of cases and has been reported to be an independent risk factor for poor renal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Mesangial deposition of secretory IgA has also been observed, although the pathogenic significance of this is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p>The immunofluorescence findings in IgA nephropathy are indistinguishable from those in IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura) nephritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Renal manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Glomerular deposition of complement component C3 is found in over 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. C1q is almost always absent, implying that complement is activated via the alternative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lectin pathways. Deposits of components of the alternative pathway, properdin and Factor H, may often be found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a study of 60 patients with IgA nephropathy, one quarter had evidence of lectin pathway activation, with glomerular deposition of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), L-ficolin, MBL-associated serine proteases <span class=\"nowrap\">(MASP-1/3),</span> and C4d [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These cases were associated with more pronounced histologic damage and higher levels of proteinuria. Mesangial C4d deposition has been associated with worse long-term renal outcome in IgA nephropathy, although further confirmatory studies are required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Glomerular fibrin deposition may be observed in the mesangium or along the endothelial surface, although this is more commonly seen in IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura) nephritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Renal manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While mesangial IgA deposition is diffuse and global in IgA nephropathy, there is significant heterogeneity in the pathologic response to this deposition, which may be focal (involving less than 50 percent of glomeruli) and segmental. The major finding on light microscopy, mesangial hypercellularity, and matrix expansion is commonly focal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62380\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62380 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Segmental crescents are relatively uncommon, although they may be missed by sampling error if only a few glomeruli are obtained. In patients with IgA nephropathy and rapidly deteriorating renal function, segmental necrosis with or without crescent formation is often seen, a finding consistent with an ongoing &quot;capillaritis.&quot;</p><p>A later clinical presentation, marked by a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increased proteinuria, is commonly associated with a renal biopsy displaying features of chronic disease: glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial inflammation, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There is some evidence that a subset of IgA nephropathy cases display biopsy features typical of a podocytopathy. Whether this represents a discrete subclass of IgA nephropathy remains to be clarified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Thrombotic microangiopathy has been variably described in association with IgA nephropathy. It is often associated with uncontrolled or malignant hypertension and portends a poor renal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. This lesion was not commonly observed in the Oxford classification study and subsequent validation studies and, therefore, may be subject to variability in its interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Electron microscopy typically reveals electron-dense deposits that are primarily limited to the mesangium (which are outside of mesangial cells in the mesangial spaces) but may also occur in the subendothelial and subepithelial spaces. The number and size of these deposits generally correlates well with the severity of changes seen on light microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Some patients with IgA nephropathy have coexisting diffuse thinning of the glomerular basement membrane that is indistinguishable from thin basement membrane nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. It is not clear whether the clinical course of such patients differs from typical IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Preliminary work from France suggests that such patients may have a more benign outcome, due possibly to lead-time bias, as hematuria brings them to the attention of clinicians at an earlier time in the natural history of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thin basement membrane nephropathy (benign familial hematuria)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lupus nephritis is another disorder associated with prominent mesangial IgA deposition. Lupus nephritis can be distinguished from IgA nephropathy histologically by the more prominent deposition of IgG than IgA and the presence of substantial C1q deposition, indicating activation of the classical complement pathway, as opposed to activation of the alternative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lectin pathway in IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of renal disease in systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxford classification of IgA nephropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A consensus on the pathologic classification of IgA nephropathy has been developed by the International IgA Nephropathy Network in collaboration with the Renal Pathology Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>] To develop this classification, clinical data and renal biopsies were obtained from 265 Caucasian and East Asian patients who were followed for a median of five years. Repeated analysis by several pathologists identified histologic variables that were consistently interpreted with a high degree of reproducibility. Four of these were shown to individually predict renal outcome, independent of clinical data: mesangial hypercellularity (M), endocapillary hypercellularity (E), segmental glomerulosclerosis (S), and tubular <span class=\"nowrap\">atrophy/interstitial</span> fibrosis (T). The predictive value of each of these variables appears to be similar in adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. It has since been shown that combining the MEST score with clinical data at the time of biopsy provides the same predictive value as monitoring clinical data for two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The utility of the Oxford classification in guiding therapy such as immunosuppression remains uncertain.</p><p>Limitations of the original study include the number of cases studied, its retrospective nature leading to treatment bias in outcome data, and selection for patients with the typical, slowly progressive course. Low-risk patients with proteinuria &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> were excluded, as were those with advanced kidney disease with an estimated GFR (eGFR) of &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73m<sup>2</sup> or with follow up for less than one year, the latter criteria effectively excluding patients with rapidly progressive disease.</p><p>A subsequent systematic review of 16 cohorts with 3893 patients found that endocapillary hypercellularity was not independently associated with renal events, although patients with this lesion were more likely to have received glucocorticoids, potentially obscuring the prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In another study of 3096 patients with expanded inclusion criteria, the presence of crescents was found to be an independent risk factor for the combined renal outcome of 50 percent decline in renal function or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) but was significant only in patients who did not receive immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The risk of the combined outcome remained significant when crescents were present in at least 25 percent of glomeruli, irrespective of whether patients had received immunosuppression. This has prompted the inclusion of a C (crescent) score in addition to the four components of the original MEST score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Based upon these data, the consensus recommendation is that every biopsy report of IgA nephropathy should include numerical scores based upon the presence or absence of these five variables (MEST-C). The suggested scoring system is defined below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>M</strong>esangial hypercellularity &ndash; Mesangial cells are counted per mesangial area, and a score of zero to three is assigned for each glomerulus. A score of zero indicates that fewer than four mesangial cells are present per mesangial area; a score of one indicates that four to five mesangial cells are present per mesangial area; a score of two indicates that six to seven mesangial cells are present per mesangial area; a score of three indicates that greater than eight mesangial cells are present per mesangial area. Scores obtained for all glomeruli are averaged, and the resulting assigned hypercellularity score is either M0 if the mean score is less than 0.5 or M1 if the mean score is greater than 0.5.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>E</strong>ndocapillary hypercellularity &ndash; This is defined as present (E1) if hypercellularity is present within glomerular capillary lumens and results in narrowing of the lumens, or absent (E0) if no hypercellularity is present within lumens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>S</strong>egmental glomerulosclerosis &ndash; This is defined as present (S1) if any part of the glomerular tuft is involved in sclerosis, or absent (S0) if no segmental glomerulosclerosis is present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>T</strong>ubular <span class=\"nowrap\">atrophy/interstitial</span> fibrosis &ndash; The percentage of the cortical area involved by tubular atrophy or interstitial fibrosis is quantitated. A score of T0, T1, or T2 is given if the percentage of involved cortical area is 0 to 25, 26 to 50, or &gt;50 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>C</strong>rescents &ndash; This feature is defined as present if cellular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrocellular crescents are present in at least one glomerulus (C1), present in at least 25 percent of glomeruli (C2), or absent (C0).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsies with fewer than eight glomeruli should be considered of uncertain value for prognosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with IgA nephropathy typically present in one of three ways; the relative frequency depends in part upon screening practices (which will lead to increased discovery of asymptomatic cases) and the particular population being evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 40 to 50 percent present with one or recurrent episodes of gross (visible) hematuria, often accompanying an upper respiratory infection. This has sometimes been called &quot;synpharyngitic hematuria.&quot; These episodes can be provoked by bacterial tonsillitis or by viral upper respiratory infections; they may occur in individuals who have already undergone tonsillectomy. It is frequently presumed, although not proven, that the first episode represents the onset of the disease. Patients may complain of flank pain during acute episodes, which usually reflects stretching of the renal capsules. Low-grade fever may also be present. These features can mimic urinary tract infection or urolithiasis. Most patients have only a few episodes of gross hematuria, and episodes usually recur for a few years at most. An initial episode of gross hematuria at age 40 years or older is rarely due to IgA nephropathy, and other diagnoses must be assessed. A discussion of clinical clues that may distinguish IgA nephropathy from poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another 30 to 40 percent have microscopic hematuria and usually mild proteinuria and are incidentally detected on a routine examination or during a diagnostic evaluation for chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In these patients, the disease is of uncertain duration. Gross hematuria will eventually occur in 20 to 25 percent of these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults#H1619098367\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Isolated glomerular hematuria'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less than 10 percent present with either nephrotic syndrome or an acute, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis characterized by edema, hypertension, and renal insufficiency as well as hematuria. Rarely, IgA nephropathy may present with malignant hypertension. It is usually presumed that patients have longstanding disease that was not detected earlier because the patient did not have gross hematuria or undergo routine urinalysis.</p><p/><p>Rarely, patients develop acute kidney injury with or without oliguria. This may be due to crescentic IgA nephropathy or to heavy glomerular hematuria leading to tubular occlusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> damage by red cells. The latter is usually a reversible phenomenon, although incomplete recovery of renal function may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>If there is crescentic IgA nephropathy, there will be an increase in the absolute number of dysmorphic red cells excreted in the urine that is typically at least 50 percent of all red cells seen.

In most reported families, the disease appears to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ASSOCIATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of IgA nephropathy are clinically restricted to the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/1-4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,8</a>], but the disease may be associated with other conditions. Some associations are well established, others are anecdotal observations that should be interpreted with caution because IgA nephropathy is a common disease, and any association may be coincidental rather than causal.</p><p>Cirrhosis, celiac disease, and HIV infection are all associated with a high frequency of glomerular IgA deposition. However, most patients have little or no evidence of glomerular disease. These observations indicate that a high circulating load of polyclonal IgA is not of itself adequate to promote the nephritis characteristic of IgA nephropathy and that other abnormalities of IgA and its metabolism, as discussed previously, are necessary for IgA deposition to translate into mesangial activation and glomerular injury. It is also important to note that the reported incidence of mesangial IgA deposition in apparently healthy individuals ranges from 3 to 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Thus, the likelihood of finding mesangial IgA deposits by chance in association with other common diseases is relatively high.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cirrhosis and other forms of severe liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mesangial IgA deposition associated with chronic liver disease, particularly alcoholic cirrhosis, is the most common form of secondary IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. It can also occur in chronic liver disease due to other causes, including hepatitis B and C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>] and, in children, end-stage liver disease due mostly to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or biliary atresia. In a study of 18 children in whom renal biopsy was performed at the time of liver transplantation, evidence of glomerulonephritis was seen in all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Most patients had IgA nephropathy, but several had a membranoproliferative pattern of injury without apparent immune complex deposition.

However, in clinical practice, the coagulopathies associated with end-stage liver disease often preclude the possibility of performing a kidney biopsy, and many clinicians will make a presumptive diagnosis.</p><p>Impaired removal of IgA-containing complexes by the Kupffer cells in the liver is thought to predispose to IgA deposition in the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The observation that IgA may also be deposited in the skin and hepatic sinusoids is compatible with this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Studies of IgA subclass distribution in IgA deposits in liver disease have been contradictory. As in primary IgA nephropathy, polymeric IgA1 appears to be the dominant IgA isoform deposited, although there is some evidence for codeposition of IgA2.</p><p>Despite the frequency of glomerular IgA deposits in advanced liver disease, most adults have no clinical signs of glomerular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>], while up to one-third of children may have asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The urinary abnormalities that may be seen in children typically resolve after successful hepatic transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Celiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glomerular IgA deposition is common in celiac disease (gluten enteropathy), occurring in as many as one-third of patients.

However, gliadin deposition cannot be demonstrated in the glomeruli, suggesting that gluten might act by increasing intestinal permeability and enhancing the absorption of other dietary antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>It remains unclear how often gliadin is an important pathogenetic factor in IgA nephropathy.

Institution of a gluten-free diet in patients with circulating antigliadin antibodies results, in most cases, in a temporary but nonsustained reduction in microscopic hematuria and proteinuria and has no impact on long-term renal survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>Due to the association between IgA nephropathy and celiac disease, we suggest that patients with IgA nephropathy who have symptoms suggestive of celiac disease (eg, diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, indigestion) be screened by serological testing (eg, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody level). Further data about the links between IgA nephropathy and gluten sensitivity are required before screening of asymptomatic patients can be recommended.

In at least some cases of HIV-associated IgA nephropathy, idiotypic IgA antibodies reactive with anti-HIV IgG or IgM antibodies can be demonstrated both in the systemic circulation and in the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Furthermore, the HIV genome can be detected in the kidney, suggesting a possible initiating role of viral infection in the glomerular cells.</p><p>The prevalence of IgA deposits in patients infected with HIV is uncertain.

However, most affected patients had little or no mesangial hypercellularity, and urinary abnormalities were mild in all cases. Thus, subclinical disease or incidental IgA deposition appears to be much more common than overt IgA nephropathy, similar to the findings noted above in cirrhosis and celiac disease.

Furthermore, many of these patients behave as if they have minimal change disease, with remission of proteinuria being induced by glucocorticoid therapy.

Light microscopy shows diffuse mesangial proliferation and matrix expansion with proliferative glomerulonephritis and segmental glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammation in more advanced disease. Electron microscopy shows dense deposits primarily in the mesangium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62380\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62380 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69895\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69895 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58102\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58102 \">picture 2</a>).
