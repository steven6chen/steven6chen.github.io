It results from a complex interaction between genes and environment, leading to a breakdown of immune tolerance and synovial inflammation in a characteristic symmetric pattern. Distinct mechanisms regulate inflammation and matrix destruction, including damage to bone and cartilage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Given the heterogeneous response to therapy, it is clear that RA in not just a single disease; instead, many pathways can lead to autoreactivity with similar clinical presentations.</p><p>The pathogenesis of RA is reviewed here. The etiology of this disorder, including putative genetic and environmental factors, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of, risk factors for, and possible causes of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28538780\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initiation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a combination of pre-determined (genetic) and stochastic (random) events. Susceptibility to RA is clearly defined by a pattern of inherited genes, with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) major histocompatability (MHC) genes as the most important. However, scores of minor genes that include cytokine promoters, T cell-signaling genes, and many others, contribute to susceptibility and severity. It is equally clear that genes are not the sole influence, since the concordance rate for identical twins is only 12 to 15 percent. Of the environmental stimuli that contribute, the best defined is smoking, which can interact with genes to increase susceptibility up to 20- to 40-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Epigenetic influences, such as abnormal DNA, dysregulated histone marks, or expression of microRNAs, can also increase proinflammatory gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>A likely mechanism for the environmental component is repeated activation of innate immunity, especially at mucosal surfaces. This process can take many years, with evidence of autoimmunity increasing gradually until some unknown process tips the balance toward clinically apparent disease. For example, cigarette smoking is strongly associated with RA and induces peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD) expression in alveolar macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These enzymes then convert arginine to citrulline in the airway, thereby creating neoantigens that can be recognized by the adaptive immune system. Increased citrullination is not specific to RA and occurs regularly with any environmental stress. What is unique to RA is the propensity for immune reactivity to the neoepitopes created by protein citrullination with the production of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs).</p><p>Other mucosal surfaces can also potentially contribute. The oral mucosa harbors <em>Porphyromonas gingivalis </em>in periodontal disease, which is also associated with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These bacteria express PADs, which can citrullinate peptides in the mouth. The gut microbiome is also altered in early RA, with a preponderance of <em>Prevotella</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The influence of the bacterial environment of the gut is not well defined, but clearly affects arthritis susceptibility and severity in many pre-clinical models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In &quot;pre-RA,&quot; ACPAs and autoantibodies like rheumatoid factors (RFs) can appear more than 10 years before clinical arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].<sup> </sup>Other antibody systems, such as to carbamylated proteins, can also occur in response to proteins where lysine is non-enzymatically converted to homocitrulline. Note that ACPAs and other antibodies against altered peptides are not truly autoantibodies, since they are actually antibodies that recognize modified proteins such as vimentin and enolase. True autoimmunity probably occurs somewhat later due to epitope spreading. The antibodies may contribute to the initiation or exacerbation of synovitis, but do not necessarily cause RA by themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A pattern of systemic inflammation is also apparent in pre-RA patients, as determined by multiplex analysis of cytokines in the serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Like autoantibodies, levels of multiple cytokines gradually increase in the years before RA symptoms occur.</p><p>Synovial biopsies in <span class=\"nowrap\">ACPA/RF-positive</span> patients with arthralgias, which could be considered &quot;pre-RA,&quot; are essentially normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A &quot;second hit&quot; is probably required to convert the predisposition to disease to clinically apparent synovial inflammation. In mouse models, this process can be mediated by immune complexes that engage the synovial innate immune system, especially mast cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Subsequent increases in vascular leakage provide access to the joint and permit complement fixation, recruitment of immune cells, and inflammation.</p><p>Once the inflammatory process is fully established, the synovium in RA organizes itself into an invasive tissue that can degrade cartilage and bone. The rheumatoid synovium has many characteristics of a locally-invasive malignancy, but it never becomes completely unresponsive to antiinflammatory and antiproliferative factors. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in the rheumatoid synovium can migrate from joint to joint, perhaps accounting for the symmetric and diffuse distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The distribution of affected joints in RA and the diversity of responses among those joints to highly targeted agents could be due to distinct biology of FLS in each location, including joint-specific changes in gene expression and DNA methylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1582562271\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS AND EPIGENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An individual&rsquo;s genome clearly plays a role in susceptibility and severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The concordance rate in identical twins is 12 to 15 percent, while first-degree relatives of RA patients also have increased risk. The most prominent genes are the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC), most notably human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, there are now over 100 different gene polymorphisms associated with RA. Most of these individually have a rather limited contribution, with odds ratios of 1.05-1.2. However, a few, like peptidyl arginine deiminases (PADs) and the T-cell signaling phosphatase encoded by PTPN11, can increase risk by about twofold. The risk genes are generally implicated in immune response, matrix regulation, and inflammation, suggesting that the mutations are causative. The genetics of RA are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA and other susceptibility genes in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism that silences gene expression when promoter regions are methylated. A variety of studies have demonstrated abnormal DNA methylation in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as synovial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Studies evaluating the methylome of RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) demonstrate a pattern of abnormal methylation in genes that have been implicated in the disease, including the complement cascade, focal adhesion, cytokine interactions, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The methylome signature is stable in these cells, persists for many months in culture, and occurs very early in the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Cytokines in the rheumatoid synovium could contribute by regulating enzymes, such as DNA methyl transferases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Other epigenetic features, such as abnormal regulation of microRNAs, have also been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Histone marks have also been implicated in RA FLS phenotype, and histone deacetylase inhibitors block cytokine gene expression and suppress inflammation in animal models of arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">T LYMPHOCYTES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activation of innate immunity is probably the earliest process in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), followed by citrullination or carbamylation, loading of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with autoantigens or altered native peptides in the joint, then migration to central lymphoid organs. Once there, APCs present an array of antigens to T cells, which can then activate B cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> migrate back to the synovium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial antigen(s) and the T lymphocyte</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T cells constitute about 50 percent or more of cells in most RA synovia; most of these are CD4+ with a memory phenotype, but only 5 percent or fewer are B lymphocytes or plasma cells. RA synovial T lymphocytes display an activated surface phenotype, with high expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR antigens and CD27. CD27+ CD4+ T cells provide B cell help that can potentially increase synovial antibody production. There appears to be a preponderance of T cells of the Th1 and Th17 subset, with deficiency of Th2 and regulatory T cells (Tregs).</p><p>It is unlikely that a single &quot;rheumatoid antigen&quot; exists. Instead, a broad spectrum of joint-specific native or modified antigens, such a type II collagen, or nonspecific citrullinated antigens, is responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Examples of citrullinated peptides that have been implicated include fibrinogen, vimentin, enolase, and collagen, each of which can elicit immune responses more efficiently than the unmodified proteins. The initiating antigen(s) probably vary from patient to patient, perhaps from joint to joint, and from early to late disease in the same patient. This concept has important implications in the search for pathogenic T cells and the likelihood that a single approach to tolerizing lymphocytes might not be effective in all patients.</p><p>For maximal T cell responses, second signals are generally required. Two of the co-stimulatory molecules through which such signals are provided are CD28 and CD40 ligand; both are highly expressed by synovial T cells in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Synergistic effects of CD40-CD40 ligand interaction and interleukin (IL)-1 on cytokine production may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>An analysis of the physical structure of the &quot;shared epitope&quot; (SE) in the third hypervariable region of the HLA-DRB chains expressed on macrophages and B cells, the APCs, has shed some light on the initial antigens likely to be responsible for RA. The risk for RA is encoded by amino acid substitutions at positions 72 to 74 and modulated by the amino acids at positions 70 and 71 of the HLA-DRB1 molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA and other susceptibility genes in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Individual alleles and the shared epitope'</a>.)</p><p>The three-dimensional reconstruction of the HLA class II antigen structure suggests that the SE may not restrict the precise structure of antigens selected for presentation to T cells. Rather, the epitope alters the conformation of the antigen-DR complex presented to the T cell receptor. As a result, it probably is not relevant for the T cell which peptide is presented in the susceptibility epitope; recognition is likely to be peptide-dependent, but not peptide-specific. These &quot;arthritogenic&quot; antigen(s) may carry a net negative charge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and frequently the citrullinated peptides bind with greater affinity than the unmodified peptide. Fine structure analyses unexpectedly suggest that amino acids 11 and 13, which are in the antigen-binding groove of the HLA molecule, have the closest association with RA in patients with the susceptibility epitope. These amino acid residues could play a role by binding to arthritogenic citrullinated peptides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In fact, the citrullinated peptides bind more avidly to RA-associated alleles than the native peptides and are presented more efficiently to T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The selective binding of altered antigens suggests that citrullination creates epitopes recognized by T cells that were not deleted during development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Costimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Costimulation is an important aspect of T cell activation during the immune response in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Presentation of antigen to T cells by antigen-presenting cells (eg, dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells) without costimulation by <span class=\"nowrap\">receptor/coreceptors</span> (such as <span class=\"nowrap\">CD28/CD80,</span> CD86, intercellular adhesion <span class=\"nowrap\">molecule-1/lymphocyte</span> function-associated antigen-1), leads to anergy and death of insufficiently activated T cells. A B7-binding molecule, CTLA-4 fused with an immunoglobulin fragment (CTLA4-Ig or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a>), is used in the treatment of patients with RA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) structure and function&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T-cell targeted therapies for rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Abatacept'</a>.)</p><p>Intriguing evidence suggests that costimulatory molecules are present in excess within rheumatoid tissue, thereby implying that T cell activation may take place without specific antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. As a result, self-perpetuating cycles of T cell proliferation sufficient to sustain autoimmunity may occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Apoptosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apoptosis (programmed cell death) has been investigated as a possible underlying defect among T cells in RA. As an example, deficiencies in normal programmed cell death due to an underlying T cell defect are a cause of autoimmune lymphoproliferation and arthritis in MRL <span class=\"nowrap\">lpr/lpr</span> mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, there is overexpression of a tumor suppressor gene p53 in rheumatoid synovium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Mutations that have been identified in p53 may prevent normal DNA repair and interfere with apoptosis processes regulated by this gene product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Other abnormalities that might contribute to increased survival of synovial cells include dysregulated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and sentrin in the intimal lining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) block protein geranylgeranylation, and some of the drugs can induce apoptosis in RA synoviocytes through mitochondrial- and caspase 3-dependent pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">T cell-mediated adaptive immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of antigens recognized by T cells may contribute to the synovial inflammatory response, either through the subsequent generation of autoantibodies by B cells or through the activation of T helper subsets like Th17 cells. Several autoantigen systems have potential as pathogenic factors. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Type II collagen'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cartilage antigen glycoprotein-39 (gp39)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Immunoglobulin G'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Citrullinated proteins and peptides'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2523551\" class=\"local\">'Carbamylation and other protein modifications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Type II collagen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One commonly implicated antigen is type II collagen, which is uniquely found in articular cartilage and the vitreous of the eye. Autoreactivity to type II collagen occurs in RA, although anti-collagen antibodies are present in a minority of patients. Some evidence suggesting autoimmunity to collagen includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Citrullinated collagen activates T cells more effectively than native collagen in patients with the RA-associated class II major histocompatibility (MHC) genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic joint inflammation can be induced in experimental models by immunization with type II collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], and by administration of monoclonal antibodies with affinity for type II collagen plus an adjuvant (<em>E.

Peptides derived from this protein (T cell epitopes of gp-39) that were defined in HLA-DR4 transgenic mice also stimulated T cells from human subjects that carried RA-associated HLA-DR4 alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Cytokines produced subsequently by these activated T cells could help drive the chronic inflammatory process. SE-positive dendritic cells presenting an immunodominant human gp39 peptide (amino acids 263-275) may be more frequently found in the synovium of patients with RA than those with other inflammatory joint diseases or with osteoarthritis (61 versus 3 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunoglobulin G</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibodies to immunoglobulin G (IgG), called rheumatoid factors (RFs), have long been implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. Circulating lymphocytes from patients with RA recognize oxidatively modified IgG in vitro by initiating a proliferative response and secreting IL-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Reactive oxygen and nitric oxide products secreted by inflammatory cells generate covalent crosslinked IgG aggregates with biologic properties of true immune complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Citrullinated proteins and peptides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) are relatively specific for RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Citrullination is catalyzed by peptidyl arginine deiminase; arginine residues on alpha enolase, vimentin, fibrin, and fibrinogen, as well as many other proteins, occur due to deimination within rheumatoid joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>]. Intracellular citrullinated proteins colocalized with the deamidase in most of RA synovial samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, citrullinated proteins are also found in the synovium of other forms of arthritis, in non-synovial tissue from patients with RA (eg, pulmonary rheumatoid nodules), in the lungs of patients with interstitial pneumonitis, in brain from patients with multiple sclerosis, and in normal brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Synovial citrullinated peptides are also found in most animal models of arthritis.</p><p>Comparisons of the SE frequencies on HLA-DRB1 alleles in healthy populations with RA patients who do or do not harbor ACPAs have shown that the SE is associated only with ACPA-positive disease and not with ACPA-negative disease. This indicates that the HLA-DRB1 alleles encoding the SE do not associate with RA as such, but rather with a particular phenotype, disease with ACPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A strong association between cigarette smoking, a known risk factor for RA, and the presence of HLA-DRB1*0404 or other HLA alleles comprising the SE has been noted for RA patients who have ACPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. One epidemiologic study showed that the relative risk of developing RA is increased 20-fold in those who had two alleles for the SE, had ever smoked cigarettes, and were ACPA-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Citrullinated proteins were present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the lungs of cigarette smokers, but were not demonstrated by immunostaining of fluid from nonsmokers. Subsequently, studies have shown that IgA and IgG ACPAs can be present in the sputum of patients with RA as well as that of first degree relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. This study connects two important risk factors for RA, namely smoking and genetic predisposition conferred by carriage of the SE. It also raises the possibility that smoking-induced citrullinated proteins may serve as a link in the process, possibly as neoantigens.</p><p>The lack of an association between smoking and risk of RA in those who are ACPA-negative suggests that these disease subsets (ACPA-positive versus ACPA-negative) differ in their pathogenesis. However, a large collaborative study of Caucasian RA patients from North America confirmed a strong association between the presence of ACPA and the shared epitope, but found only a weak association between ACPA formation and smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. On the other hand, another study demonstrated a moderately strong association between ACPA and tobacco exposure, irrespective of the presence of the SE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The most likely explanation for the propensity to form ACPAs in individuals with the SE is the avid binding of the altered protein to the RA-associated MHC molecules.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2523551\"><span class=\"h3\">Carbamylation and other protein modifications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The citrullination system has been widely studied in RA, but it is probably one of many mechanisms that can create neoepitopes that predispose to the development of inflammatory arthritis. In addition, antibodies that recognize carbamylated proteins have subsequently also been discovered in patients with RA. Rather than converting arginine to citrulline, stressed cells can also convert lysine to homocitrulline. In one study, about 30 percent of ACPA negative patients with RA have detectable levels of anti-carbamylated protein antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Like ACPAs, these antibodies can also precede the development of clinical disease in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The MHC associations for this subset will probably differ from the traditional ACPA positive RA if the carbamylated peptides bind more avidly to different alleles. In addition, a new antibody system directed at malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde adducts created by oxidative stress has been identified in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2925753821\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serendipitous discovery of a strain of T-cell receptor transgenic mice that spontaneously develop chronic arthritis with histologic features similar to RA led to identification of a widely distributed enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), as an autoantigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Antibodies to this protein probably do not play a major role in RA, although they provide lessons on how autoreactivity against a ubiquitous antigen might result in joint-specific inflammation. In this case, the protein probably coats the surface of cartilage and is displayed in a way that optimizes complement fixation in the presence of antibody. Anti-GPI antibodies are present in a relatively low percentage of RA patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Some data suggest that the prevalence of anti-GPI antibodies may correlate with extraarticular manifestations of RA. As an example, in a study of 131 Dutch patients, the proportions with anti-GPI antibodies were as follows: in uncomplicated disease: 5 percent; in those with rheumatoid nodules: 18 percent; rheumatoid vasculitis: 45 percent; and Felty syndrome: 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3952806529\"><span class=\"h1\">B LYMPHOCYTES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rheumatoid factors (RFs) are immunoglobulins (Ig) reactive against epitopes on the Fc portion of IgG (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Immunoglobulin G'</a> above).

IL-10 is a potent B cell-stimulating factor, in addition to its cytokine-suppressing activity. The levels of this cytokine are elevated in RA, although it is probably made by macrophages in the synovium. Thus, the cytokine milieu could contribute to activating B cells by inducing their proliferation and immunoglobulin production in the absence of specific antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. Other cytokines, like IL-6, BLyS (B lymphocyte stimulator, also known as BAFF, B cell activating factor), and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand), are present in RA synovium and can influence the differentiation and activation of B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>As discussed in more detail elsewhere, anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) and possibly anti-carbamylated peptide antibodies are relatively specific for RA (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies'</a>) Citrulline is formed by the action of peptidylarginine deiminases (PADIs) on peptidylarginine. PADIs are expressed at high levels in inflamed rheumatoid synovium; one major substrate appears to be fibrin. The immunoreactivity of citrullinated fibrin with IgA and IgM in the RA synovium and the colocalization of PADI and citrullinated peptides supports the notion that citrullinated fibrin is a potential autoantigen of RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/54,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,77</a>].</p><p>ACPAs are present in the earliest stages of disease in almost 70 percent of rheumatoid patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

Thus, deiminated antigens formed in the synovium could be involved in driving the local antibody response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2275588511\"><span class=\"h2\">Affinity maturation of autoantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatic rearrangement of germline genes is a crucial factor in the eventual development of RFs with a higher affinity for IgG than the original RFs. This &quot;affinity maturation&quot; is probably an antigen-driven process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. During this process, RFs change from being polyreactive with a low affinity for many antigens (eg, insulin, tetanus toxoid, beta-2-microglobulin) to being monoreactive with a much higher affinity for human Fc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. In addition, the tight complexes between monoreactive RF and IgG can activate complement.

These complexes can be found in all tissues of the rheumatoid joint, and may help concentrate additional material within this structure. As an example, within the superficial layers of articular cartilage in rheumatoid joints are RF-IgG complexes, antibodies against native and denatured type II cartilage collagen, and activated components of complement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Cartilage destruction is facilitated by proteolytic degradation of matrix components by enzymes such as neutrophil elastase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

The mechanism of benefit is uncertain, as B cell depletion in the tissue does not correlate well with local autoantibody production or cytokine expression.

This event is accompanied by the transudation of fluid and the transmigration of both lymphocytes into the synovium and of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the synovial fluid. In the mature RA synovium, the mass of tissue is too much for even the multiple new capillaries to nourish, and local tissue ischemia is the result. The mean PO2 in rheumatoid synovial fluid is usually 30 mmHg, and occasionally is less than 15 mmHg.</p><p>Relative synovial hypoxia is associated with an increased production of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) that activates transcription of genes that are of fundamental importance for angiogenesis, including those for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the VEGF receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>Without new blood vessels, there would be no nutrients to support the highly catabolic synovium in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-92</a>].

These cellular adhesion molecules expedite activation-dependent sticking of leukocytes, thereby facilitating diapedesis and extravasation into the synovium.

Chemokine bind to G-protein-coupled receptors, which then activate PI3Kgamma. This kinase serves as the convergence point for multiple chemokines and is an attractive target to overcome the redundant chemokine system.

Because of its avidity for type II collagen as a substrate, however, and its induction by cell attachment to cartilage, it may be the primary MMP involved in joint destruction. MMP-13 is produced by synovial fibroblasts, not macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>]. A chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1, which is produced in RA synovium, increases the secretion of MMP-13 in cultured human chondrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/166\" class=\"abstract_t\">166</a>].</p><p>As with many other biologic systems, there is a metalloproteinase cascade. For example, collagenase-1 (MMP-1) is released from cells as a pro-enzyme. Subsequently, MMP-3 (stromelysin), which has no collagenolytic activity but can degrade multiple other substrates including break-down products of collagen and type IV (basement membrane) collagen, activates procollagenase to collagenase, often in concert with plasmin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/167\" class=\"abstract_t\">167</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Cartilage destruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activated rheumatoid synovium eventually destroys cartilage at the cartilage-pannus junction. Cartilage can be damaged by direct invasion by the synovial cells, most notably by aggressive RA FLS. Using electron microscopy, a 0.5 to 1.0 micron amorphous zone can be found between the cell processes and relatively intact cartilage, indicating that proteases released from the invasive cells are bringing about the degradation of the glycosaminoglycans and collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. Proteoglycans (chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, etc) are degraded early in the inflammatory process; the loss of collagen takes longer. Rare are areas of rapid chondrolysis; these areas include synovial lining cells which have phagolysosomes containing engulfed fragments of cartilage collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>]. In addition, chondrocytes can produce proteases that can degrade cartilage from within, in addition to the exogenous destructive effects of pannus and proteases produced by neutrophils in synovial fluid.</p><p>After a critical mass of synovitis has accumulated within a joint, the synovium invades the edge of cartilage at the joint capsule.

Osteoclasts activated by synovial cytokines, including RANKL and cathepsins B, K, and L, add to the destructive capacity of metalloproteinases in destroying bone. The role of immune cells in osteoclast activation is now widely recognized. Activated T cells and bone marrow stromal cells produce receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL), that is essential for the differentiation, activation, and survival of osteoclasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/174\" class=\"abstract_t\">174</a>]. IL-18, mainly produced by macrophages in RA, has similar proinflammatory effects as does tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and also induces RANKL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/175\" class=\"abstract_t\">175</a>].</p><p>Monocyte migration is also enhanced by RANKL an effect that could favor the accumulation of osteoclast precursors in the synovium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/176\" class=\"abstract_t\">176</a>]. A modulator of this is osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble receptor that competitively binds RANKL.

As noted above, stromelysin (metalloproteinase-3, MMP-3) is an important protease because it degrades cartilage proteoglycans, fibronectin, and type IV collagen in basement membrane, and activates collagenase. Patients who are homozygous for a polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene for MMP-3 have more rapid radiographic progression of erosive disease than those without this genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>].

Neutrophils subsequently deposit gene products (released from the cells after being synthesized) and the contents of granules (from three types: azurophil, specific, and &quot;C&quot;) in the synovial fluid.

C3a is inactivated by an enzyme that cleaves its terminal arginine residue (C3adesArg).

NO synthesis is induced by cytokines in macrophages, synovial cells, and chondrocytes. Although well-recognized as endothelial-derived relaxing factor, NO has a less well-defined role in inflammatory states. NO may reduce endothelial expression of endothelial adhesion molecules. On the other hand, NO also may interact with superoxide to produce toxic peroxynitrite and, in concert with neutrophils, may be toxic to endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/207,208\" class=\"abstract_t\">207,208</a>].</p><p>Articular chondrocytes may produce and respond to NO.

SP can activate macrophages, stimulate B cell differentiation, cause fibroblast proliferation, attract neutrophils, and increase expression of cytokines, prostaglandins, and metalloproteinases. SP acts by binding to the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R). Increased levels of SP are found in the synovial fluid and serum of RA patients, and NK-1R mRNA is upregulated in RA synoviocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/211\" class=\"abstract_t\">211</a>]. Continuous external application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> can deplete SP from nerve endings, and suppress neurogenic inflammation, thereby benefiting occasional patients with joint pain of diverse etiology.</p><p>Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) may play a local, proinflammatory role in rheumatoid synovium. Higher concentrations of CRH are found in synovial fluid of patients with RA compared with those with osteoarthritis and a higher density of CRH receptors in synovium is also present in those with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/212,213\" class=\"abstract_t\">212,213</a>].</p><p>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), in contrast to SP and CRH, may have antiinflammatory properties, and CGRP-containing nerve fiber density is lower in samples of synovium of patient with RA compared with those with OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/214\" class=\"abstract_t\">214</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Arachidonic acid metabolites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arachidonic acid (AA) is a cell membrane fatty acid that is oxidized to prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and lipoxins; the enzyme responsible for releasing AA from membrane phospholipids is phospholipase A2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/215\" class=\"abstract_t\">215</a>]. The wide variety of these lipid mediators in synovial fluid, which include lipoxin A4 and resolvin D5, have been characterized using mass spectrometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/216\" class=\"abstract_t\">216</a>]. When injected into animal joints, phospholipase A2 causes a marked inflammatory and proliferative synovitis. Phospholipase A2 is increased in rheumatoid synovial fluids and is inhibited by glucocorticoids; in addition, its synthesis is induced by interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).</p><p>Prostaglandins are generated by the actions of cyclooxygenase (COX) on AA. A major role of prostaglandin E2 in RA is to stimulate periarticular bone resorption early in disease, before the development of erosions of bone or cartilage. In one animal model of erosive arthritis, the effect of prostaglandin E2 on bone and cartilage resorption appeared to be mediated through the PGE2 type 4 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/217\" class=\"abstract_t\">217</a>].</p><p>In addition, the prostaglandins enhance the manifestations of acute inflammation in joints.

More selective COX-2 inhibitors are used in some patients because they do not inhibit the formation of prostaglandins that protect the stomach and duodenum from acid, and are less likely to produce ulcers or upper gastrointestinal bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of selective COX-2 inhibitors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>5-lipoxygenase also uses arachidonic acid as a substrate. One of its final products, LTB4, is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant (along with IL-8, C5a, and platelet activating factor [PAF]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/220\" class=\"abstract_t\">220</a>]. However, targeting LTB4 receptors has, thus far, not proven useful in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/221\" class=\"abstract_t\">221</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Clotting factors and fibrinolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors responsible for clotting and fibrinolysis may have a role in RA.

Fibrin itself may facilitate cell growth and adhesion within the synovial pannus. The products of platelet aggregation, including formation of microparticles from platelets, are also implicated in RA. Microparticles can be detected in RA synovial effusions and mediate their proinflammatory functions, in part, through the generation of IL-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/224\" class=\"abstract_t\">224</a>].</p><p>Serine proteases that are mediators of fibrinolysis, including plasminogen activators and plasmin, may also contribute to cartilage degradation.

In addition, the in vitro transfer of a gene for a serine protease inhibitor to synoviocytes from patients with RA decreased the destructive and invasive capacity of such cells when incubated with human cartilage in vitro or in immunosuppressed (SCID) mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1656072\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initiation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) results from a combination of predetermined (genetic) and stochastic (random environmental) events. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) major histocompatability (MHC) genes are the most important, but many other genes are involved and contribute to susceptibility and severity. The most likely mechanism for the environmental component is repeated activation of innate immunity. There is a propensity in RA for immune reactivity to develop to the neoepitopes created by the protein modification, such as citrullination, that results from environmental stressors like smoking; this leads to the production of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) that could initiate inflammation by fixing complement in the tissues. Like antibodies, levels of multiple cytokines gradually increase in the years before RA symptoms occur. (See <a href=\"#H28538780\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the autoimmune process is established, the synovium in RA organizes into an invasive tissue that can degrade cartilage and bone. The rheumatoid synovium has many characteristics of a locally-invasive tumor. (See <a href=\"#H28538780\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of innate immunity is probably the earliest process in RA, followed by citrullination, loading of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with either native or modified proteins in the joint, and then migration to central lymphoid organs. Once there, APCs present an array of antigens to T cells, which can then activate B cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> can migrate back to the synovium. It is unlikely that a single &quot;rheumatoid antigen&quot; exists. Instead, a broad spectrum of joint-specific antigens, such a type II collagen or nonspecific citrullinated antigens, is responsible. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'T lymphocytes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the earliest histopathologic responses in RA is the generation of new synovial blood vessels, which is accompanied by the transudation of fluid and the transmigration of both lymphocytes into the synovium and of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the synovial fluid. As the new vessels develop, cytokines produced in the synovium in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activate endothelial cells to produce adhesion molecules, which expedite activation-dependent sticking of leukocytes, thereby facilitating diapedesis and extravasation into the synovium. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Angiogenesis and inflammatory cell recruitment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autocrine and paracrine communication through the elaboration of a cascading network of proinflammatory cytokines plays a key role in initiation and perpetuation of RA and result in a &quot;transformed phenotype&quot; of synovial lining cells. Inflammatory cells are recruited to the bland synovium by the actions of interleukin (IL)-17A, TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, vascular endothelial growth factor, alarmins like IL-33 and high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), and chemokines. Retention in the synovium is facilitated by inhibition of apoptosis and other innate immunity mechanisms by interferon (IFN)-alpha and -beta, IL-15, and TNF. The T cells become organized and activated in the presence of IL-23, IL-27, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, and chemokines. Simultaneously, the <span class=\"nowrap\">proliferative/destructive</span> component of synovitis is generated by TNF, IL-17, bone morphogenic proteins, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Mast cell products may also have an important role. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Cytokine networks in rheumatoid arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cadherin-11, a synovial fibroblast membrane protein, mediates the organization and invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) into synovial tissue. Activated rheumatoid synovium eventually destroys cartilage at the cartilage-pannus junction. The destruction of cartilage, bone, and tendons in RA is initiated largely by metalloproteinases. At sites of active RA, there is a dramatic imbalance of bone turnover in which local bone resorption outweighs bone formation. (See <a href=\"#H9030106\" class=\"local\">'Tissue reaction and matrix remodeling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of B cells is supported by the therapeutic effect of B cell-targeted biologic agents. The mechanism of action for B cells is uncertain, but could involve either pathogenic antibody projection, cytokine production, or antigen presentation. (See <a href=\"#H3952806529\" class=\"local\">'B lymphocytes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cellular components of rheumatoid synovial fluid differ from those in the synovium. As examples, neutrophils are rarely seen in RA synovium but are abundant in RA synovial effusions, and there is a predominance of CD4+ T cells in the tissue while CD8+ cells are typically more prevalent in the fluid. Products of neutrophils that are released into the synovial fluid can cause considerable damage and can potentiate inflammation in the adjacent synovium. (See <a href=\"#H9030247\" class=\"local\">'Synovial fluid in rheumatoid arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement activation and its interactions with immune complexes are important in RA, especially in synovial effusions and at the cartilage interface. Additional factors, including nitric oxide (NO), neuropeptides, and arachidonic acid metabolites, may play a contributory role in the pathogenesis of RA.
