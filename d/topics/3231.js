It accounts for less than 1 percent of ectopic pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The incidence is approximately 1 in 9000 deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Cervical pregnancy may be more common in pregnancies achieved through assisted reproductive technologies; it occurs in 0.1 percent of in vitro fertilization pregnancies and accounts for 3.7 percent of IVF ectopic gestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The cause is unknown; local pathology related to previous cervical or uterine surgery may play a role given an apparent association with a prior history of curettage or cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Another theory is rapid transport of the fertilized ovum into the endocervical canal before it is capable of nidation or because of an unreceptive endometrium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptom of cervical pregnancy is vaginal bleeding, which is often profuse and painless [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Lower abdominal pain or cramps occur in fewer than one-third of patients; pain without bleeding is rare. It is important to think about the possibility of cervical pregnancy in such patients since early diagnosis is critical to avoidance of complications and successful treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general approach to evaluation of pregnant women with first trimester bleeding is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the etiology and evaluation of vaginal bleeding in pregnant women&quot;, section on 'First trimester bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>On speculum examination, the external os may be open, revealing fetal membranes or pregnancy tissue, which appear blue or purple. Infrequently, a cystic lesion on the cervical lip is observed and represents trophoblastic invasion into the cervical stroma.</p><p>Ideally, if cervical pregnancy is suspected, bimanual examination is avoided until imaging studies have excluded the diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below). If bimanual examination is performed, the endocervical canal should not be explored as this is likely to cause hemorrhage. A prominent finding on bimanual examination of cervical pregnancy is a soft cervix that is disproportionately enlarged compared to the uterus; this has been called &quot;an hour-glass&quot; shaped uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. By comparison, enlargement of the uterus without significant cervical enlargement is characteristic of intrauterine pregnancy, although the cervix softens and becomes mildly congested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a woman with a positive pregnancy test, the clinical diagnosis of cervical pregnancy is based upon findings on transvaginal ultrasound examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/3,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6-8</a>]. A correct diagnosis is important to avoid interventions which could lead to severe hemorrhage necessitating hysterectomy.</p><p>Sonographic criteria for diagnosis of cervical pregnancy consist of [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>gestational sac or placenta within the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57961\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57961 \">image 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>normal endometrial stripe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>hourglass (figure of eight) shaped uterus with ballooned cervical canal</p><p/><p>Additional signs include visualization of an embryo or fetus in the intracervical area and gestational sac below the level of the internal cervical os or uterine arteries. A sonographic impression of cervical pregnancy is correct in 87.5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The main differential consideration for cervical ectopic pregnancy is an incomplete abortion that is proximal to the cervix. Typical features that differentiate a cervical pregnancy from an incomplete abortion include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>cardiac activity is often seen in a cervical pregnancy with a visible embryo, but not in an incomplete abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>the gestational sac of a cervical pregnancy has regular contours, while an incomplete abortion sac often has irregular contours that may change shape during the scan</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>the cervical os is typically closed in a cervical pregnancy, but is open in an incomplete abortion</p><p/><p>Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in unusual or complicated cases when the diagnosis is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Rubin defined histologic criteria for cervical pregnancy, but a histologic diagnosis is not clinically practical since it requires hysterectomy. Rubin's criteria consist of: close attachment of the placenta to the cervix, cervical glands present opposite the implantation site, placental location below uterine vessel insertion or below anterior and posterior reflections of the visceral peritoneum of the uterus, and no fetal elements in the uterine corpus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term cervical abortion has been used to describe an aborting intrauterine pregnancy that is trapped in the endocervical canal because of resistance from the external cervical os. An intrauterine pregnancy in the process of aborting can mimic a cervical pregnancy if the products of conception have not passed through the external cervical os. This diagnosis is likely if ultrasound reveals some products of <span class=\"nowrap\">conception/blood</span> clot in the uterine cavity, the uterine cavity is enlarged compared to the cervix, the internal cervical os is open, or the gestational sac is flattened and has no or a minimal echogenic rim and contains no or a dead embryo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In addition, a cervical abortion should not show any signs of trophoblastic invading the cervical stroma or cardiac activity; the presence of intracervical peritrophoblastic blood flow by <span class=\"nowrap\">color/pulsed</span> Doppler ultrasound or cardiac activity suggests a true cervical pregnancy. Cervical pregnancy rather than incomplete abortion is also suggested by a negative sliding sac sign: no movement of the intracervical sac when the vaginal transducer is used to apply gentle pressure to the cervix.</p><p>If the diagnosis is uncertain, repeating the ultrasound the next day to see if the sac has moved (suggestive of a cervical abortion) or performing magnetic resonance imaging can help clarify the diagnosis.</p><p>Differential diagnosis also includes cesarean or hysterotomy scar pregnancy, which should be considered if the gestational sac is in the anterior lower uterine segment and the uterine cavity and endocervical canal are empty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We treat hemodynamically stable women with cervical pregnancy medically using multidose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) therapy with or without intraamniotic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intrafetal injection of local <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> (KCL) (eg, intracardiac injection of about 5 mEq potassium chloride) when fetal cardiac activity is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This treatment results in ablation of the ectopic gestation and allows preservation of the uterus in at least 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Diagnosis and treatment early in pregnancy are important since most cases of severe hemorrhage and need for hysterectomy have occurred in pregnancies in the late first and early second trimesters.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Criteria have been proposed for selecting patients who are most likely to have a successful outcome from medical therapy of tubal ectopic pregnancy, as well those who should undergo a primary surgical approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Methotrexate therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, there are no criteria for selecting appropriate candidates for medical treatment of cervical pregnancy, other than ensuring that the patient is hemodynamically stable. One reason for this difference is that experience with cervical pregnancy is too limited to allow any firm conclusions about optimal criteria for medical therapy. As an example, the<strong> presence of fetal cardiac activity</strong> (present in 60 percent of cervical pregnancies in contrast to 10 percent of tubal pregnancies) is a poor prognostic factor for successful medical therapy of tubal pregnancy, but whether this is also true for cervical pregnancy is not known. Another factor is that when weighing risks and benefits of medical versus surgical therapy, there is a higher tolerance for complications from medical therapy of cervical pregnancy compared to tubal pregnancy since the alternative, surgical therapy, carries a significant risk of hemorrhage when the pregnancy is cervical.</p><p>Experience with use of MTX for treatment of cervical pregnancy is limited to case reports and small series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/3,6,16-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,16-23</a>]. Various medical therapies have been used (single or multidose systemic MTX, local intrasac injection of MTX or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a>, or combinations of these therapies) and were efficacious in 80 to 90 percent of cases. There were no complications other than the usual side effects of MTX therapy.</p><p>Intramuscular multidose MTX alone is often adequate for treatment of very early cervical pregnancies without fetal cardiac activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. We give MTX intramuscularly, rather than intravenously, as the intramuscular approach is more convenient and there are no data indicating that one route is superior to the other. The multidose MTX drug protocol is the same as that used in patients with tubal ectopic pregnancy and is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Methotrexate therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, more advanced gestations where fetal cardiac activity is present require combined treatment with both intramuscular multidose MTX and intraamniotic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intrafetal injection of KCL to cause prompt fetal death and thus facilitate pregnancy resorption, which can take a few months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. We perform intrasac injection in the operating room because there is a risk of hemorrhage when the sac collapses. A 20-22 gauge needle is advanced transvaginally into the gestational sac and fetal thorax under direct ultrasound visualization using a needle guide attachment. When the tip of the needle is in the embryo, KCL (1 to 5 mL of 20 percent KCL solution) is injected until there is cessation of cardiac activity. However, we have also successfully treated cervical pregnancy with fetal cardiac activity with multidose MTX alone. This approach is practical and eliminates a possible risk of intrasac KCL injection. &#160;</p><p>Heavy vaginal bleeding when the pregnancy is involuting may require intraarterial embolization to control hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Uterine artery embolization'</a> below.) If this is not successful, then dilation and evacuation is the next step; hysterectomy is a last resort. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Surgical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional treatment of cervical pregnancy has been dilation and curettage, with hysterectomy if there is uncontrolled hemorrhage. However, we feel that avoidance of hysterectomy is desirable since it precludes further childbearing and is a major operation. Our preference is preoperative uterine artery embolization. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Uterine artery embolization'</a> below.)</p><p>Dilation and evacuation is a conservative surgical option. The main complication is a high incidence of severe hemorrhage, which can be reduced by preoperative measures such as transvaginal ligation of the cervical branches of the uterine arteries, cervical cerclage, uterine artery embolization, or intracervical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> injection. The latter is given by injecting 20 to 30 mL of vasopressin (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/mL)</span> solution with a 1.5-inch 21 gauge needle circumferentially deep into the dense cervical stroma. Transvaginal ligation of the cervicovaginal branches of the uterine artery can be performed, as well. This is done by deviating the cervix to one side and placing a suture at 3 and 9 o'clock on the lateral side of the cervix. The suture is placed high just below the lateral vaginal fornix, similar to sutures placed for hemostasis during cold knife conization. We use 2-0 polyglactin (Vicryl) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. Nevertheless, one study reported successful treatment of 13 cases of cervical pregnancy with curettage and balloon tamponade only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>If postoperative implantation site bleeding occurs, it can often be controlled by placing a size 26 Foley catheter with a 30 mL balloon into the dilated cervix, with the tip extending into the uterine cavity. Sterile water (as much as 95 mL) is used to inflate the balloon and tamponade the bleeding vessels for 24 to 48 hours. A purse string suture can be placed around the external cervical os and tied after inflation of the balloon to prevent expulsion. After 24 to 48 hours, the balloon is gradually deflated over a period of hours to days and removed, but may be reinflated at any time if bleeding picks up or recurs. The catheter also allows constant uterine drainage.</p><p>Additional measures that can be employed in women who continue to bleed include placement of hemostatic sutures locally in the cervix, angiographic embolization, bilateral internal iliac artery ligation, and bilateral uterine artery ligation. Hysteroscopic resection with a resectoscope has also been reported to be successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hysterectomy is an option for women who have completed their families or have additional uterine pathology and do not want to assume the risk of hemorrhage, which can occur in the course of conservative surgery or medical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine artery embolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine artery embolization prior to evacuation of cervical pregnancy may be an effective method for preventing hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/3,23,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,23,30-32</a>]. In one small series, this approach was successful in avoiding hysterectomy or laparotomy in <span class=\"nowrap\">16/16</span> cases. By comparison, a literature review reported 71 percent of 41 cases treated without such preoperative preparation resulted in massive hemorrhage; seven cases ended in hysterectomy and five cases were treated with bilateral internal iliac or uterine artery ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Uterine artery embolization can also be performed to control hemorrhage occurring postoperatively or in conjunction with medical therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interventional radiology in management of gynecological disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gelfoam provides temporary obstruction (two to six weeks) of the feeding blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/6,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19</a>] and allows for development of collateral blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Because collateral flow begins to develop within hours of the procedure, surgical evacuation should be performed soon after embolization to achieve the full benefit of the procedure. The optimal interval between uterine artery embolization and surgical evacuation has not been established, intervals of several hours to 24 hours have been described.</p><p>There have been no reports of a procedure-related ischemic effect on the uterus; however, reflux of embolic material to the posterior division of the hypogastric artery can cause claudication of the lower abdomen and buttocks, which is usually transient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/3,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,33</a>].</p><p>Although uterine artery embolization is a promising technique for reducing morbidity in women with cervical pregnancy, further investigation is required before this approach can be recommended routinely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY OUTCOME IN SUBSEQUENT GESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A review of 37 pregnancies two months to several years after a cervical pregnancy reported the following: 21 women delivered at term (including one set of twins at 38 weeks), four delivered prematurely (at 25, 28, 32, and 36 weeks of gestation), three miscarried at 8 to 9 weeks of gestation, two underwent elective pregnancy termination, two had tubal pregnancies, one had a repeat cervical pregnancy (pregnancy conceived by IVF), and four had ongoing pregnancies at the time of the report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].
