In addition to dementia, distinctive clinical features include: visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, cognitive fluctuations, dysautonomia, sleep disorders, and neuroleptic sensitivity.</p><p>First described in the 1960s, DLB has a varied clinical presentation that shares features with other degenerative dementias. It was often overlooked pathologically because of the difficulty in identifying cortical Lewy bodies. With the advent of immunohistochemical stains for constituents of Lewy bodies, the prevalence of this disorder began to be recognized. However, challenges remain in defining this as a distinct entity from other degenerative dementias.</p><p>There is some clinical imperative to diagnose DLB, as optimal treatment choices (for best efficacy and limitation of significant side effects) are specific to DLB. However, DLB continues to be underrecognized, and the clinical diagnostic criteria continue to be refined to improve specificity and sensitivity.</p><p>This article will describe the prognosis and treatment of DLB. The epidemiology, neuropathology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis are discussed separately.

Psychotic symptoms, particularly visual hallucinations, tend to persist in patients with DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Parkinsonism also worsens over time, especially in patients for whom this is an early feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In one retrospective series, individuals with impairment of visuospatial skill on baseline neuropsychologic testing had a faster rate of clinical decline compared with those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>While some have reported that the rates of cognitive decline are similar for Alzheimer disease (AD) and DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>], others report a more stable course for DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and others have found a faster rate of cognitive decline in DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In one series, patients with DLB lost an average of 5.8 points per year on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) compared with 4.1 points for AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this study, survival time in DLB was also shorter than in AD: 7.7 versus 9.3 years since onset of cognitive symptoms, a finding corroborated in another cohort of patients with AD and DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The degree of motor parkinsonism and psychiatric symptoms appears to contribute to earlier institutionalization compared with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and possibly shorter survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Increased hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has also been associated with significantly shorter survival time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of DLB is symptomatic, targeted toward specific disease manifestations, and based upon somewhat limited evidence.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpharmacologic management of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patient and caregiver education regarding risks, benefits, and limitations of treatments is important. In many cases, treatment choices represent a trade-off between parkinsonism and psychosis, and the relative preferences of the patient and caregiver will be decisive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7685079\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognition and neuropsychiatric disturbances</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cholinesterase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholinesterase inhibitors may represent a first-line pharmacologic treatment in DLB, although the evidence is as yet somewhat limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. While cholinesterase inhibitors were initially developed for Alzheimer disease (AD), the evidence suggests that cholinergic deficits are even greater in DLB.</p><p>Multiple anecdotal reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], open-label studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>], and a limited number of randomized, controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>] suggest that cholinesterase inhibitors are efficacious in DLB, with reported benefit not only in cognition, but also for fluctuations, psychotic symptoms, and parkinsonian symptoms. In some instances, the response has been dramatic, but temporary. The effect size has been reported to be larger than that in patients with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivastigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rivastigmine</a> &ndash; A multicenter study randomly assigned 120 patients with DLB to rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg per day) or placebo for 20 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Patients and caregivers should be warned about the possibility of severe side effects. In addition to neuroleptic sensitivity reactions more specific to DLB, these drugs are associated with an increased risk of death when used in older adult patients with dementia.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are commonly used in the treatment of depression.
