Such approaches have been exploited by nutritionists and clinicians as evidence-based and less costly alternatives to several classes of drugs. These differ with respect to mechanism of action and to the degree and type of lipid lowering. Thus, the indications for a particular dietary supplement are influenced by the underlying lipid abnormality.</p><p>The characteristics and efficacy of the lipid-lowering dietary supplements or dietary components will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FISH OIL AND OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Populations with high intakes of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (such as the Inuit) have low rates of heart disease; this observation has increased interest in the possible benefit of fish oils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids come from fatty fish, especially salmon, and plant sources such as flaxseed and flaxseed oil, canola oil, soybean oil, and nuts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fish oil and marine omega-3 fatty acids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-fat#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary fat&quot;, section on 'Polyunsaturated fatty acids'</a>.)</p><p>Fish oil concentrate administered at high doses (&gt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> can reduce levels of triglycerides through inhibition of the synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglycerides and apolipoprotein B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In hypertriglyceridemic subjects, fish oils (in a dose of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> lower triglyceride levels by approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Similarly large reductions in triglyceride levels with fish oil have also been seen in patients with HIV and hypertriglyceridemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiovascular-risk-including-dyslipidemia-in-the-hiv-infected-patient#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiovascular risk (including dyslipidemia) in the HIV-infected patient&quot;, section on 'Fish oil'</a>.)</p><p>Since fish oil lowers plasma triglyceride concentrations, which in turn is a determinant of small dense low density lipoprotein (LDL), it is possible that fish oils will decrease the concentration of small LDL. Support for this hypothesis comes from the observed reduction of cholesteryl ester transfer activity following fish oil therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, several studies have observed an increase in overall LDL particle size with 4 g purified docosahexaenoic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In contrast, 2.5 g of omega-3 fatty acids daily for two months did not significantly change this fraction in 16 noninsulin-dependent diabetics when compared to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The clinical effects and side effects of fish oil consumption <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> supplementation are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fish oil and marine omega-3 fatty acids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pharmacologic use of fish oils supplements should be restricted to patients with refractory hypertriglyceridemia. The use of fish oil for this purpose is also discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertriglyceridemia#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertriglyceridemia&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>There has been interest in the United States and elsewhere in particular omega-3 supplements other than fish oil, although the clinical benefits of particular supplements have generally not been adequately studied. Interventions using flaxseed appear to reduce low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), but these may be limited to flaxseed and flaxseed lignans; flaxseed oil does not clearly lower LDL-C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Flaxseed and flaxseed derivatives do not seem to reduce triglyceride levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Clinical effects of omega-3 fatty acid consumption are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-fat#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary fat&quot;, section on 'Polyunsaturated fatty acids'</a>.)</p><p>Krill oil is a rich source of n-3 fatty acids and antioxidants from a small crustacean in the Antarctic Ocean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Based on a meta-analysis of data from seven randomized controlled trials with 662 participants, krill oil supplementation reduces LDL-C (&minus;15.<span class=\"nowrap\">5mg/dL;</span> 95%CI, &minus;28.4 to &minus;2.6; p = 0.018) and triglycerides (&minus;14.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> 95%CI, &minus;21.4 to &minus;6.7; p&lt;0.001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were increased (weighted mean difference, 6.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> 95% CI, 2.3 to 11.0; p = 0.003). More studies are needed to assess the impact of krill oil supplementation on other indices of cardiometabolic risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SOY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soy, an excellent source of protein, also contains isoflavones, which are phytoestrogens. Isoflavones are micronutrient substances that, in nonhuman primates, have properties similar to estrogen, including an effect on cholesterol levels and inhibition on low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It has been suggested that the lower risk of heart disease among Asian compared to Western populations is due to the high consumption of soybean products.</p><p>Although earlier trials and a meta-analysis had suggested important lipid benefits with consumption of soy protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>], a subsequent systematic review concluded that benefits were at most small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The systematic review found that when very large amounts of soy protein (average 50 grams daily) were substituted for other dietary proteins (about half of usual total protein intake), LDL-cholesterol concentrations decreased by an average of approximately 3 percent. No significant effect was found on HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, or lipoprotein (a). The review also found that soy isoflavones had no effect on LDL-cholesterol or on other lipid risk factors.</p><p>Apart from lipid effects, it is possible that intake of soy proteins has other vascular benefits. One animal study found that phytoestrogens produced endothelium-independent relaxation of coronary arteries as a result of calcium antagonism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Studies in healthy humans found that the phytoestrogen genistein caused endothelium-dependent vasodilation with a similar potency to estradiol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. This beneficial effect on endothelial function, in the absence of any change in lipids, may be related to soy isoflavones, without soy protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/23,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25,26</a>]. In a consecutive series of 126 patients with coronary artery disease, stroke or diabetes, greater isoflavone intakes (median 26 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/d,</span> range, 20 to 58) was associated with better vascular endothelial function and lower carotid atherosclerotic burden (14.5 percent relative decrease in maximum intima-media thickness). This inverse association was not observed with soy protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The ingestion of soy protein also may be associated with adverse effects. As an example, in a study of 108 men and 105 postmenopausal women (all healthy), soy protein improved both blood pressure and lipids, but did not improve vascular function as measured by systemic arterial compliance and pulse wave velocity. Adverse effects included an increase in serum lipoprotein (a) and a decline in endothelial function (in men only) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;, section on 'Phytoestrogens'</a>.)</p><p>It is not clear whether the estrogen-like activities of isoflavones increase the risk of breast cancer, as they may increase breast secretions and the proliferation of breast epithelium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy and the risk of breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We agree with the recommendations and conclusions of an advisory from the Nutrition Committee of the American Heart Association that performed the review discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substituting soy protein for other proteins does not appear to have clinically important health benefits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isoflavone supplements do not appear to be of benefit and should not be taken with a goal of improving lipids and cardiovascular risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When substituted for animal-derived foods, many soy foods and food products (eg, tofu, soy butter, edamame, some soy burgers, etc.) are likely to have beneficial effects on lipids and cardiovascular health because they are low in saturated fats, high in unsaturated fats, and often rich in fiber.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RED YEAST RICE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Red yeast rice is a fermented rice product that has been used in Chinese cuisine and medicinally to promote &quot;blood circulation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The product contains varying amounts of a family of naturally occurring substances called monacolins that have HMG CoA reductase inhibitor activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statins: Actions, side effects, and administration&quot;</a>). Other active ingredients in red yeast rice that may affect cholesterol lowering include sterols (beta-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, sapogenin), isoflavones, and monounsaturated fatty acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of red yeast rice for cholesterol lowering was evaluated in a prospective, double-blind study in which 83 patients with hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol 204 to 338 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5.28&ndash;8.74 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L],</span> LDL-C 128 to 277 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.31&ndash;7.16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> who were not receiving cholesterol lowering therapy were randomly assigned to receive red yeast rice (2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> or placebo; both groups were also advised to follow a cholesterol lowering diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The total cholesterol concentration decreased significantly between baseline and eight weeks in the red yeast rice compared with the placebo-treated group (208 versus 251 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5.38 vs 6.57 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The LDL-C concentration also decreased significantly in the red yeast rice group (135 versus 175 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.49 versus 4.53 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HDL-C was unaffected.</p><p/><p>One of the monacolins in the red yeast rice extract used in this study, monacolin K, is the active ingredient in the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lovastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lovastatin</a>. The daily lovastatin content of red yeast rice was 0.2 percent of the total product, which at a total dose of red yeast rice of 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> translates into a daily lovastatin dose of 4.8 mg. This is considerably lower than the average 20 to 40 mg dose of lovastatin used in clinical trials of cholesterol lowering, suggesting that other active ingredients in red yeast rice probably also contributed to its cholesterol lowering activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Other studies have also found that red yeast rice lowers total and LDL-C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In one randomized trial, patients who had discontinued statin therapy because of myalgias tolerated treatment with red yeast rice 1800 mg twice daily at a rate similar to placebo, while achieving significant reductions in LDL-C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, there was no statin control arm to see whether patients might have tolerated re-challenge with a dose of statin able to achieve similar LDL-C reductions.</p><p>Not all strains of red yeast rice are alike and results of these clinical trials may not generalize to different preparations. There is substantial variability across commercial preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. As an example, in a study that evaluated the content of twelve preparations of commercially available red yeast rice, the total monacolin content ranged from 0.31 to 11.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/capsule</span> and monacolin K (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lovastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lovastatin</a>) ranged from 0.10 to 10.09 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/capsule;</span> four of the preparations had elevated levels of citrinin, a potentially nephrotoxic mycotoxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Furthermore, while short-term studies (up to four months) have found red yeast rice to be safe, no long-term studies have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>In summary, red yeast rice may have cholesterol lowering ability due to the presence of monacolins that have HMG CoA reductase inhibitor activity, and possibly other active substances. However, these extracts suffer from the same problem as many other natural products, that is, a lack of standardization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This results in marked variability across brands in the content of the active ingredient and thus in efficacy in reducing LDL-C (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of herbal medicine and dietary supplements&quot;</a>).

The authors of the US study suggested that possible explanations for the differing results between the Indian and US studies include differences in the populations' genetics, diet, and body fat composition. Additionally, though, methodologic concerns have been raised about both Indian studies. These include that one of the trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] did not have a placebo arm. A further issue for the other Indian study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] is that concerns have been raised about the accuracy of other papers published by these same authors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>].</p><p>We do not recommend the use of guggulipid for treatment of hypercholesterolemia until further efficacy and safety data are available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">POLICOSANOL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Policosanol is a drug extracted from sugar cane wax. It contains a number of aliphatic alcohols. It appears to be well tolerated and some studies suggested that at doses of 10 to 20 mg daily it could reduce LDL-C concentrations by as much as 25 percent or more and could raise HDL-C by up to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>However, a multicenter randomized trial in 143 patients found no evidence that policosanol, over a range of doses from 10 to 80 mg daily, was different from placebo in its effects on LDL-C, HDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, or lipoprotein (a) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Additionally, there are only limited data on clinical endpoints.

The evidence for this and for many health claims about coconut oil is limited. The evidence for an increase in HDL-C with coconut oil comes from animal studies and small, nonrandomized studies of virgin coconut oil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Virgin coconut oil is made using controlled temperature methods to retain the greatest amounts of phytosterols, tocotrienols, tocopherols, and other biologic active compounds in contrast to refined coconut oil or copra oil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]; however, industry standards are lacking. Virgin oil may contain from 8 to 29 mg gallic acid equivalents per 100 g oil; in contrast, the refined counterpart contains about 6 mg equivalents per 100 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Fatty acid content does not differ however, with saturated fatty acid content (92 percent) that exceeds that of butter.</p><p>Findings from many earlier clinical feeding trials in humans and animals support the premise that the saturated fatty acids in coconut oil (primarily lauric, myristic) raise LDL-C concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].

They also appear to have immunomodulatory and vasodilatory properties that could contribute to cardiovascular risk reduction. Polyphenols include flavonoids and flavonoid derivatives, lignans, phenolic acids, and stilbenes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>An observational study found an inverse association between mortality (total mortality as well as CHD mortality) and intake of flavanones and certain foods rich in flavonoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>A randomized crossover trial in 200 men compared the effects on serum lipids of virgin olive oil (high in polyphenols), refined olive oil (low in polyphenols), and a mixture of the two with intermediate polyphenol content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

In a report from the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort, after 74 months this dietary pattern was inversely associated with incidence of metabolic syndrome (odds ratio 0.20) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/154,155\" class=\"abstract_t\">154,155</a>].</p><p>A randomized trial in patients who had had a myocardial infarction found fewer subsequent cardiac events among those assigned to a Mediterranean diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>].

The trial was stopped early after a median follow-up of 4.8 years. For the primary composite cardiovascular endpoint of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death, event rates were similar for the Mediterranean diets supplemented with olive oil and mixed nuts, and lower than for the control diet (8.1 and 8.0 events per 1000 person-years respectively, versus 11.2 events per 1000 person-years; HR for both Mediterranean diets combined 0.71, 95% CI 0.56-0.90). Although this trial suggests possible substantial cardiovascular benefits from a Mediterranean diet, there was a surprisingly large reduction in events, a low total number of events (288), and the trial was stopped early for benefit. This raises concerns that the apparent benefits of a Mediterranean diet could have been overestimated, since this can be a problem in trials that are stopped early for benefit, particularly when there are also relatively few events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/160-162\" class=\"abstract_t\">160-162</a>].</p><p>Further support for such a dietary pattern (high intakes of vegetables, fruit, legumes, whole grains, and fish) comes from a cohort study of 24,444 postmenopausal women where such a pattern, along with three other low-risk lifestyle behaviors, was associated with a 92 percent decreased risk of myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>].
