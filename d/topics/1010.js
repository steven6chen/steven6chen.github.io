The incidence of recurrent linear immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining in the transplant may be as high as 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-gbm-antibody-disease-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, most patients remain asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-gbm-antibody-disease-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>There are only six reported cases of symptomatic recurrent anti-GBM disease in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-gbm-antibody-disease-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A related phenomenon is the development of de novo anti-GBM disease in patients with Alport syndrome (also known as Alport posttransplant anti-GBM nephritis), which can lead to graft loss in up to 5 percent of recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-gbm-antibody-disease-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews recurrent anti-GBM disease after transplantation. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of anti-GBM disease are discussed elsewhere.

Collagen IV is a family of six alpha chains (alpha-1 through alpha-6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-gbm-antibody-disease-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The alpha-3, alpha-4, and alpha-5 chains form a triple helical protomer, and oligomerization of alpha-345 protomers, by means of NC1-NC1 end-to-end associations, forms the hexameric NC1 domain.</p><p>The alpha-345 network is also a target for anti-GBM alloantibodies in anti-GBM disease following transplantation in patients with Alport syndrome (also known as Alport posttransplant anti-GBM nephritis). This anti-GBM syndrome is mediated by the deposition of alloantibodies to the alpha5(IV)NC1 domain in response to the &quot;foreign&quot; alpha-345 collagen network that is absent in the kidneys of patients with Alport syndrome but present in the renal allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-gbm-antibody-disease-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>In one study, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the specificity of circulating autoantibodies and kidney-bound antibodies in patients with anti-GBM disease or Alport posttransplant anti-GBM nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-gbm-antibody-disease-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among those with anti-GBM disease, autoantibodies to the alpha3(IV)NC1 monomer and alpha5(IV)NC1 monomer were detected in 100 and 79 percent of patients, respectively; fewer patients had autoantibodies to the alpha-4NC1 monomer. Autoantibodies in patients with anti-GBM disease bound to distinct, hidden epitopes in the alpha3(IV)NC1 and alpha5(IV)NC1 monomers but did not bind to the native alpha345(IV)NC1 hexamer until it was denatured, suggesting that dissociation or conformational change of the NC1 hexamer in vivo is required to expose the epitopes for antibody binding. By contrast, in patients with Alport posttransplant anti-GBM nephritis, alloantibodies bound to the alpha5(IV)NC1 epitope in the intact hexamer, and binding decreased with hexamer dissociation. Thus, the alpha345(IV)NC1 hexamer is targeted by antibodies that arise in both recurrent anti-GBM disease and in Alport posttransplant anti-GBM nephritis, but these antibodies have different binding properties.</p><p>Although anti-GBM disease usually is mediated by immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies, in rare cases, anti-GBM antibodies of immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) class are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-gbm-antibody-disease-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. There is one case study of a 62-year-old man with anti-GBM disease mediated by a monoclonal IgA-kappa antibody, which progressed to end-stage renal disease despite intensive immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-gbm-antibody-disease-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. He subsequently underwent living-related kidney transplantation and developed recurrent anti-GBM disease with lung hemorrhage and crescentic glomerulonephritis, resulting in allograft failure two years later. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated circulating IgA antibodies reactive against a basement membrane component, identified by ELISA and Western blot as the <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha1/alpha2(IV)</span> collagen chains. Sensitivity to digestion with collagenase indicated that the IgA was bound to epitopes located in the collagenous domain rather than the more typical NC1 domain.</p><p>The relatively low rate of significant recurrence of anti-GBM disease is thought to be due to delaying renal transplantation until circulating anti-GBM antibody levels have been undetectable for at least 12 months and there has been quiescent disease for at least six months posttreatment (without cytotoxic agents) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-gbm-antibody-disease-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. The general lack of late recurrence reflects the usually self-limited nature of autoantibody formation in this disorder. In addition, the administration of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy may help suppress autoantibody production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-gbm-antibody-disease-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3822368987\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with clinically evident recurrence of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease typically present with hematuria, proteinuria, and an elevated serum creatinine.
