This can lead to problems, such as liver damage, heart damage, joint pain, and weakness.</p><p>Hemochromatosis is caused by abnormal genes and can run in families. If your parent, brother, sister, or child has hemochromatosis, ask your doctor or nurse about getting tested for it.</p><p>Most people find out they have hemochromatosis after a screening test. Anyone who has a family member with the condition should get screened with a blood test. People with symptoms of too much iron, or an abnormal blood test showing high iron levels, should also be tested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16277083\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hemochromatosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people find out they have hemochromatosis before they have any symptoms.</p><p>If a person does have symptoms before they are diagnosed, the symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling weak or tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in the color of the skin that make it look darker</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in the size of the liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64960 \">figure 1</a>) </p><p/><p>Sometimes there are no symptoms, but routine lab tests (that are done for other reasons) show problems that could be a sign of hemochromatosis. These might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal blood tests of the liver</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal blood sugar</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal thyroid tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High levels of iron in the blood</p><p/><p>If hemochromatosis is not treated, it can lead to long-term problems that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver damage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart damage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High sugar levels in the blood (diabetes mellitus)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble getting or keeping an erection (in men)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absent or irregular monthly periods (in women)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16277090\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hemochromatosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can do different blood tests to check the iron level in your blood. If the iron level is high, they can test for the hemochromatosis gene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16277097\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hemochromatosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have the gene but your iron level is normal, you might not need treatment right away. Your doctor can do regular blood tests to check your iron level. If your iron level gets too high, then you need treatment.</p><p>When treatment is needed, most people are treated by having some of their blood removed on a regular basis, similar to donating blood. This treatment works because taking blood from a person's body can lower his or her iron level.</p><p>If you are being treated for hemochromatosis, you will probably have blood taken once a week until your iron level is normal. This usually takes about a year. To track how well the treatment is working, your doctor or nurse will probably do a blood test to check your iron level every 1 to 2 months.</p><p>Once your iron level is normal, you will have treatment to keep your iron level from getting too high again. This involves having blood taken every 2 to 4 months. Most people need this treatment for the rest of their life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16277104\"><span class=\"h1\">What other treatments might I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might need other treatments if your hemochromatosis leads to long-term problems. For example, if you get diabetes, you might need to take diabetes medicines.</p><p>If you have certain liver problems, you will need follow-up tests to check your liver for the rest of your life. That's because people with certain liver problems caused by hemochromatosis have a higher chance of getting liver cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16277111\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to help keep my iron levels low?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You should avoid iron supplements and vitamins with extra iron. It is fine to take a regular vitamin without extra iron.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16277118\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I drink alcohol?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends. Ask your doctor or nurse if it is OK for you to drink alcohol. People who have hemochromatosis and certain liver problems should not drink alcohol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16277125\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have hemochromatosis and want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse. They can help you understand the chances that your baby will get the abnormal gene. Even if your baby does get hemochromatosis, he or she will not have any symptoms or need treatment until adulthood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16277132\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donation-giving-blood-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood donation (giving blood) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cirrhosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in men (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=absent-or-irregular-periods-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Absent or irregular periods (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemochromatosis-hereditary-iron-overload-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemochromatosis (hereditary iron overload) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donation-and-transfusion-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Blood donation and transfusion (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-overview-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Overview (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cirrhosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-men-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in men (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=absent-or-irregular-periods-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Absent or irregular periods (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
