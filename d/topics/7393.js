(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p>Primary idiopathic FSGS, which occurs in the absence of a known etiology, commonly progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). When transplantation is performed, primary idiopathic FSGS may recur in the renal allograft.</p><p>An overview of FSGS in the renal allograft is presented in this topic review. The pathogenesis and treatment of FSGS in the native kidney are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1110880582\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FSGS in the allograft may be recurrent or de novo. Both recurrent and de novo FSGS may be primary idiopathic or related to known causes, such as infection, toxin exposure, genetic mutation, or obesity. In addition, FSGS may develop as a result of hyperfiltration injury related to loss of functioning kidney parenchyma; this form of FSGS is traditionally called secondary FSGS. In this review, FSGS related to a known cause other than hyperfiltration is referred to as primary non-idiopathic FSGS. FSGS that is without a known cause is called primary idiopathic FSGS. The term secondary FSGS is reserved for FSGS that is due to hyperfiltration injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1045081412\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of recurrence of primary idiopathic FSGS is difficult to ascertain since it is often not clear whether the patient had primary idiopathic FSGS or FSGS related to other causes as the initial cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although the reported FSGS recurrence rate averages approximately 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/1-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-11</a>], it is likely that some of the patients in these studies had FSGS due to a toxin, viral infection, or hyperfiltration injury that would not be expected to recur in the transplant. Thus, the rate of recurrence among patients with primary idiopathic FSGS may be higher than 30 percent. There is, for example, a subgroup in which the disease recurs in approximately one-half of cases. These patients, who almost certainly have primary idiopathic FSGS, tend to be &lt;20 years of age and to have had a rapid clinical course, with the interval from diagnosis of FSGS to ESRD being less than three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/1,4,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,12,13</a>].</p><p>Overall, among patients with FSGS as a cause of ESRD in the native kidney, allograft loss due to recurrent FSGS is not uncommon. Two large studies in adults examined the incidence of graft loss due to recurrence of FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study evaluated 221 renal transplant recipients in the Australia and New Zealand Transplant Registry with a history of ESRD due to biopsy-proven FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The incidence of allograft loss at 10 years due to recurrent disease was 12.7 percent (95% CI 7.3-21.6).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report analyzed 3861 recipients of solitary kidney transplants with a primary diagnosis of FSGS from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The reported rate of graft loss due to recurrence was only 2.6 percent with a mean follow-up of three years. However, 8 percent of patients were lost to follow-up.</p><p/><p>The incidence of allograft loss due to recurrent FSGS has also been evaluated in children. A study based upon the North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study (NAPRTCS) database compared transplant outcomes of 752 pediatric patients with FSGS with 5732 control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In this analysis, graft loss from recurrent FSGS among children was 6.1 percent at five years.</p><p>These studies underestimate the overall risk of recurrence since not all patients who have recurrent disease have allograft failure. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Five histologic patterns of FSGS have been recognized, which are associated with different clinical manifestations and prognoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>). It is not clear whether the histologic subtype observed in recurrent FSGS is generally the same subtype as that observed in the native kidney. Two studies have looked at this, with different results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one multicenter study that included 21 cases of recurrent FSGS in 19 patients, 81 percent had recurrence of the same histologic subtype as was present in the native kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a later study from France of 77 patients, the histologic subtype in the native kidney did not predict that which recurred in the allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>Differences in the study populations (adult versus pediatric) may explain the discrepant results between studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The timing of the biopsy, which was much later in the French study cited above, may also have contributed to the different results since the FSGS lesion may evolve over time.</p><p>De novo FSGS may also occur in the transplanted kidney among patients who did not have FSGS as a cause of ESRD in the native kidney. The incidence of this is difficult to estimate since the cause of ESRD in the native kidney is unknown among many transplant recipients. In one study of 4913 transplant recipients, 57 patients developed biopsy-demonstrated FSGS in the transplanted kidney at a follow-up of 1.8 years; of these, 30 (53 percent) had known FSGS in the native kidney, and 27 (47 percent) did not have a renal biopsy of the native kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. From these data, one can estimate that new FSGS develops in &lt;0.6 percent of allografts since at least some of the patients in this group probably had undiagnosed FSGS in the native kidney. However, because of the relatively limited follow-up (less than two years), this study underestimated the rate of incidence of new-onset secondary FSGS related to hyperfiltration injury, which generally takes longer to develop. (See <a href=\"#H195632586\" class=\"local\">'De novo primary non-idiopathic FSGS'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1107666570\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major risk factors for recurrence of FSGS include childhood onset of initial disease, rapid progression of initial disease, white race, and a history of recurrence in a prior allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. In the United States, white recipients of African-American kidneys may be at particularly high risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. On the other hand, black recipients appear to represent a lower risk group, in which recurrence is less frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>].</p><p>Initial sensitivity to steroids may predict recurrence. This was suggested by a study of 125 pediatric transplant recipients who had steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (&gt;95 percent with biopsy-demonstrated FSGS) as the cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the native kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients who had initial steroid sensitivity (defined as complete remission of proteinuria at least once after steroid therapy) were more likely to have recurrence, compared with patients who were always steroid resistant (26 of 28 [or 92.9 percent] versus 26 of 86 [or 30.2 percent], respectively).</p><p>As described above, five histologic patterns of FSGS have been recognized, which are associated with different clinical manifestations and prognoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the histologic subtype observed in the native kidney does not predict the risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A family history of FSGS generally predicts a low risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In 48 kidney transplants from the Duke registry of familial FSGS, which includes patients with FSGS and one family member with either biopsy-proven FSGS or high-grade proteinuria, only one posttransplant recurrence of FSGS was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The risk of recurrence of familial FSGS may depend upon the specific mutation. Recurrent disease has been reported among patients with podocin mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-30</a>] and in one patient with a <em>TRPC6</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an Italian study of 53 patients with apparently sporadic steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome who had undergone renal transplantation, mutations in the gene for podocin were found in 13 patients, of whom 9 had homozygous or compound heterozygous defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Two patients had posttransplant recurrence, with clinical features and response to therapy that were indistinguishable from those with recurrence of nongenetic forms of FSGS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 53 patients identified from the European FSGS Transplantation Study Group who received at least one renal allograft, 11 had homozygous or compound heterozygous podocin mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. None of the patients with podocin mutations had recurrence, compared with 45 percent of those without mutations.</p><p/><p>Other studies have also found low recurrence rates among patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous podocin mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Many of these studies are complicated since, with nonfamilial cases, it is difficult to identify which alterations in podocin are disease-causing mutations and which are innocent variants. In addition, most cases of posttransplant recurrence with podocin (<em>NPHS2</em>) mutations are still responsive to aggressive therapy, despite being resistant to therapy pretransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The significance of heterozygous podocin mutations in the risk of posttransplant recurrence has not been extensively studied. One study reported recurrence in two of five patients (40 percent), a figure similar to sporadic primary idiopathic FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In the international cohort study cited above, however, four patients had solitary heterozygous mutations with no recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Some have questioned whether various immunosuppressive regimens have altered the risk of recurrence and, in particular, whether the use of calcineurin inhibitors has decreased the risk of recurrent FSGS in the modern era of transplantation. Most studies suggest that the choice of immunosuppressive therapies has no effect on the chances of recurrence. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review of renal transplant recipients performed at a single center between December 1999 and March 2007, approximately 23 percent (15 out of 66) of patients with biopsy-proven FSGS had recurrence at a mean of 5.3 months after transplantation, which is not significantly different from the incidence cited in older series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 16 children with biopsy-proven FSGS who received allografts between 1985 and 2007, nine (56 percent) had recurrent FSGS within a mean of 9.6 days after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Increased protein excretion may be noted in the early posttransplant period; in children, the median time to recurrent proteinuria is approximately 10 to 14 days after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/5,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,32</a>].

If the ratio is &gt;0.5, we usually obtain a 24-hour protein collection to confirm the result obtained with the random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, although some clinicians do not do this. The rationale underlying aggressive screening is that recurrent primary FSGS may result in the rapid development of nephrotic syndrome with numerous sequelae, including massive volume overload, acute kidney injury (AKI), and hyperlipidemia. In addition, recurrent primary FSGS commonly leads to loss of the allograft (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below). Although the efficacy of immunomodulatory therapies for recurrent FSGS is unproven, early institution of therapy is believed to be more likely to be effective than delayed treatment.

As an example, in one study, in which 27 patients who received rituximab at the time of transplantation were compared with 14 historical controls who did not receive rituximab, rituximab treatment was associated with a lower incidence of posttransplant proteinuria and stabilization of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

Allograft histology demonstrates characteristic features of FSGS that are identical to FSGS in the native kidney.

Thus, viral infection should be treated prior to instituting treatment that is specifically directed at recurrent primary idiopathic FSGS. Hypogammaglobulinemia is commonly associated with FSGS and should also be treated since the correction of hypogammaglobulinemia may help to treat underlying viral infections (which may or may not be identified) and prevent complications such as infection with encapsulating organisms. The treatment of specific viral infection among renal transplant recipients is discussed elsewhere.

Our approach to treatment is determined by the timing of onset of recurrence and, in part, by the severity of proteinuria. We generally treat patients who present within one year of transplantation and who have protein excretion &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> with plasmapheresis. Our rationale is that, compared with those who present later, such patients are more likely to have primary idiopathic FSGS, rather than primary non-idiopathic or secondary FSGS, and are thus more likely to respond to plasmapheresis. Reports have suggested that plasmapheresis may induce remission of proteinuria among selected patients with primary idiopathic FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/4,35,37,38,79-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,35,37,38,79-82</a>]. However, given the absence of conclusive data demonstrating a benefit and given the cost and potential side effects of plasmapheresis, some nephrologists do not routinely administer this therapy to patients with recurrent disease unless the patient is severely nephrotic (ie, markedly low albumin and edema). Among patients who are selected for treatment with plasmapheresis, a typical regimen is 1.5 plasma volume exchanges for three consecutive days and then every other day for a total of two weeks. A small dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; ie, 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> is administered after plasmapheresis sessions to replace depleted antibodies.</p><p>It is hypothesized that recurrent primary idiopathic FSGS that occurs within a short time after transplantation is caused by a circulating permeability factor. The strongest candidate for the circulating factor, the serum soluble urokinase receptor (suPAR), was shown to be removed effectively with plasmapheresis with a resulting clinical response in one defining study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In this study, two patients who had a reduction in suPAR to near physiologic levels achieved remission of recurrent FSGS, while two patients whose suPAR levels remained elevated did not experience remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. However, other reports have not shown a correlation between suPAR and FSGS. The potential role of suPAR in FSGS pathogenesis is discussed elsewhere.</p><p>Plasmapheresis and protein adsorption have been shown to reduce protein excretion and induce complete remission in at least some cases of recurrent FSGS in multiple other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/13,35,37,38,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,35,37,38,80</a>].

The antimetabolite must be stopped when cyclophosphamide is started. Thus, the cyclophosphamide is a replacement for the antimetabolite. The administration of cyclophosphamide has been tried in selected cases of recurrent FSGS with variable success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>] and in primary FSGS in the native kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/90-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-93</a>].

However, the efficacy of this approach is not proven.</p><p>A case report and a small, uncontrolled study suggested that preemptive plasmapheresis lowers the risk of recurrent FSGS among patients at high risk for recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/99,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,114</a>]. A well-designed, larger trial is required to determine whether plasmapheresis has any role in this setting.</p><p>A small case series suggests that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> may prevent FSGS recurrence in a second transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Four patients who underwent a second transplant because the first one failed due recurrence of FSGS received rituximab (four patients received a single dose [375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>]</span> immediately after transplantation, and two patients received an additional dose at day 7). All patients were free of recurrence at follow-ups between 12 to 54 months long.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21563250\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) commonly recurs in the transplanted kidney. The reported recurrence rate averages approximately 30 percent, although this rate includes cases of FSGS due to infection, medications, or hyperfiltration injury, which is much less likely than primary idiopathic FSGS to recur; as a result, the real recurrence rate of primary idiopathic FSGS is probably much higher. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1045081412\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major risk factors for recurrence include childhood onset of initial disease, rapid progression of initial disease, and a history of recurrence in a prior allograft. In the United States, white recipients of African-American kidneys may be at particularly high risk of recurrence. The histologic subtype of FSGS does not appear to predict the risk of recurrence. A family history of FSGS generally predicts a low risk of recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H1107666570\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have recurrent primary FSGS typically present with the rapid onset of proteinuria, which is frequently in the nephrotic range. To detect early recurrence, at-risk patients are screened for proteinuria with a random or spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio on the first postoperative day, the day of scheduled hospital discharge, weekly for four weeks, and then monthly for one year after transplantation. If the ratio is &gt;0.5, a 24-hour protein collection should be obtained for confirmation. A renal biopsy should be performed if posttransplantation proteinuria exceeds 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">gram/day</span>. The diagnosis of FSGS is made by renal biopsy findings in the setting of significant proteinuria (&gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">gram/day)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H954569040\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No immunosuppressive therapies have been conclusively shown to prevent FSGS in the transplanted kidney. Two small studies have suggested that prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> administration may prevent the recurrence of FSGS. Among transplant recipients who have a history of FSGS as a cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), we suggest not using rituximab or prophylactic plasmapheresis to prevent recurrence (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal treatment of patients with recurrent FSGS is not known. Our approach includes nonimmunosuppressive treatment for all patients and immunosuppressive treatment for selected patients, depending upon the timing of recurrence, severity of proteinuria, and presence of <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> of nephrotic syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H698428\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent primary idiopathic FSGS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For all patients with recurrent FSGS, we recommend treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Such treatment has been shown to prevent the progression of most proteinuric renal disease in the nontransplant population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who have polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evidence of infection with a virus that is associated with FSGS (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], BK, and hepatitis C virus [HCV]), we suggest antiviral treatment, if possible, prior to administering plasmapheresis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients who do not respond to antiviral treatment with a reduction in proteinuria, we administer plasmapheresis, as described below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who have significant proteinuria (ie, &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> despite ACE inhibitors or ARBs, who have no evidence of active or untreated viral infection, and who present within one year of transplantation, we suggest plasmapheresis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">However, given the absence of conclusive data demonstrating a benefit and given the cost and potential side effects of plasmapheresis, some nephrologists do not routinely administer this therapy to patients with recurrent disease, unless the patient has nephrotic-range proteinuria (ie, &gt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> and significant signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms of nephrotic syndrome, despite ACE inhibitors or ARBS. For patients who are selected for treatment with plasmapheresis, a typical regimen is 1.5 plasma volume exchanges for three consecutive days and then every other day for a total of two weeks. A small dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; ie, 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> is administered after plasmapheresis sessions to replace depleted antibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who present beyond one year from transplantation; who have nephrotic-range proteinuria (ie, &gt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> and significant signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms of nephrotic syndrome despite ACE inhibitors or ARBs; and who have no evidence of active or untreated viral infection, we suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, rather than plasmapheresis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We administer 100 mg orally daily. Since virtually all renal transplantation patients are already being treated with an antimetabolite such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil as part of their immunosuppressive regimen, the antimetabolite must be stopped when cyclophosphamide is started. The dose of cyclophosphamide should be adjusted for renal function. For patients who do not respond to cyclophosphamide with a reduction in protein excretion after 6 to 12 weeks, we suggest plasmapheresis as described above (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who present beyond one year from transplantation and who have proteinuria &lt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> we suggest continuing their standard immunosuppressive regimen to prevent rejection, but not using specific immunosuppressive therapies to treat FSGS (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Choy BY, Chan TM, Lai KN.
