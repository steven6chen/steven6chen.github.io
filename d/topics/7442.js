Most cases are brought to medical attention by their parents because the ingestion was witnessed or reported to them. Many of the children are asymptomatic or have transient symptoms at the time of the ingestion. Clinical management focuses on identifying and treating the cases at risk for complications, which depends on the location and type of foreign body. </p><p>The diagnosis and management of foreign bodies in the esophagus are discussed here. Concerns specific to ingestion of button batteries (disk batteries) are discussed in greater detail separately. Management of gastric bezoars is discussed elsewhere.

The majority of foreign body ingestions occur in children between the ages of six months and three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]. Ingestion of multiple foreign objects and repeated episodes are uncommon occurrences and usually occur in children with developmental delay or behavioral problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Fortunately, most foreign bodies that reach the gastrointestinal tract pass spontaneously. Only 10 to 20 percent require endoscopic removal, and less than 1 percent require surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/1,5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,9</a>].

Serious sequelae (eg, esophageal burn, perforation, or fistula) occurs in about 3 percent of all button battery ingestions. In addition to direct pressure necrosis, contact of the flat esophageal wall with both poles of the battery conducts electricity, resulting in liquefaction necrosis and perforation of the esophagus. Retained batteries also can cause problems through leakage of caustic material (generally batteries contain a heavy metal like mercury, silver, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a>, and a strong hydroxide of sodium or potassium) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/5,6,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,19</a>].

In children presenting with a food impaction, there is a higher incidence of underlying esophageal pathology (strictures, achalasia, web or ring, or esophageal motility disorders) as compared with children with other esophageal foreign bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/4,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23,24</a>]. Reflux esophagitis and eosinophilic esophagitis also predispose to food impaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnets &ndash; With the increasing use of small magnets in toys and household items, ingestion of magnets has become a serious health hazard in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-32</a>]. High-powered magnets composed of neodymium (also known as rare earth magnets) are now common components of household appliances. These magnets are also commonly available in the form of desk toys and stress relievers (eg, Buckyballs), which consist of 200 or more small magnetic balls, cubes, or cylinders. Although these are marketed to adults, they have been involved in many ingestion incidents in children. Many of the children with complications from multiple magnet ingestion had underlying conditions such as developmental delay or autism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In some cases, an older child has inadvertently swallowed these magnets while using them to imitate a pierced tongue, so the risk is not limited to young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>]. In 2011, the United States Consumer Safety Product Commission (CPSC) issued an <a href=\"http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Newsroom/News-Releases/2012/CPSC-Warns-High-Powered-Magnets-and-Children-Make-a-Deadly-Mix/&amp;token=DuevsdIWgvh20JdRsVMy+Th4Fk8Mqh5buFJSH4y7JznqSRP1OvUVMdx/YLCVhU/tTB3VyVH3F/71BTEIRpBD/JmfahQlAJ6a/2VBrshhMukPdSDSHjzqelGs2rq7SMejmLzAWvIP3SrL4/2Jmrsanw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5888\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">alert</a> describing the safety risks of this type of magnet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and legislation to restrict the sale of these products remains contentious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long objects &ndash; Foreign bodies that are long and blunt, such as toothbrushes, batteries, and spoons, are most frequently ingested by older children, adolescents, or adults. The associated risk, and the approach to management, depend on the length and other characteristics of the object. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superabsorbent polymers &ndash; Toys and household products made of superabsorbent polymers present a risk for bowel obstruction if ingested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. These objects can expand 30 to 60 times in volume when hydrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Several of these toys were voluntarily removed from the market in the United States in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], but other products are still available. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Objects containing lead &ndash; Objects with high lead content include lead weights used for fishing (sinkers), curtain weights, air rifle pellets, and some toys or medallions. Acute lead toxicity may occur after ingestion of these objects, and fatalities have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wireless endoscopy capsules &ndash; Capsules used for capsule endoscopy are occasionally retained in the gastrointestinal tract. This complication is more common in patients with an underlying pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>] and may require endoscopic or surgical removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

Objects that become lodged in the middle portion of the esophagus are more likely to represent esophageal pathology, such as an esophageal spasm or stricture (which if present may be related to esophagitis including eosinophilic esophagitis). Sections of the esophagus with prior surgery or congenital malformations (eg, tracheoesophageal fistula) pose an increased risk as sites for obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Children presenting with food bolus impaction are particularly likely to have underlying esophageal pathology directly responsible for the impaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with esophageal foreign bodies are brought to medical attention by their parents because the ingestion was witnessed or reported to them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/1,5,46,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,46,49</a>]. In these settings, they often are asymptomatic. As an example, in a case series of 325 pediatric patients, only half of the children with an esophageal foreign body displayed symptoms at the time of the ingestion, such as retrosternal pain, cyanosis, or dysphagia, and in many of these cases the symptoms were transient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>When symptoms do occur, they are often related to the location of the foreign body: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Esophagus</strong> &ndash; Patients with an esophageal foreign body may be asymptomatic, or may present with refusal to eat, dysphagia, drooling, or respiratory symptoms including wheezing, stridor, or choking. Older children may be able to localize the sensation of something stuck in the neck or lower chest, suggesting irritation in the upper or lower esophagus, respectively. Children with complaints of retrosternal chest pain are more likely to have mucosal ulceration of the esophagus when evaluated by endoscopy, especially if the foreign body has been present for more than 72 hours, or was found unexpectedly on chest imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

They also can damage the mucosa and lead to strictures, or erode the esophageal wall, creating a fistula with the trachea or other nearby structures. Sharp objects may perforate the esophagus, resulting in neck swelling, crepitus, or pneumomediastinum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Erosion into the aorta has also been reported, causing life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/20,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stomach and intestines</strong> &ndash; Objects that reach the stomach are typically asymptomatic, unless they are large enough to cause gastric outlet obstruction, which could present with vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> feeding refusal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In true gastric outlet obstruction, symptoms include marked, non-bilious vomiting and gastric distension. Occasionally, foreign bodies may be retained in the distal gastrointestinal tract, where they can cause delayed complications. Case reports describe cecal retention of a coin mimicking appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], pyogenic liver abscess caused by migration of a sharp object from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], retention of a long object in the appendix presenting as appendicitis several years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], and perforation of the ileum by ingested gravel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful history and physical examination are the keystones in diagnosing an esophageal foreign body and to the prevention of its complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Imaging can be used to confirm the findings and to localize the site of the foreign body. The diagnostic steps and treatment depend on the patient's symptoms, the shape and location of the foreign body, whether it is radio-opaque, or whether it has magnetic properties (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57363\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57363 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83942\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef83942 \">algorithm 2A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway and breathing should always be examined first. The physical examination of the neck may reveal swelling, erythema, or crepitus, suggesting that an esophageal perforation has occurred, and surgical consultation is mandatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The chest examination may reveal inspiratory stridor or expiratory wheezing, suggesting a lodged esophageal foreign body with tracheal compression. The abdominal examination may show evidence of small bowel obstruction or perforation, in which case immediate surgical consultation and abdominal imaging should be obtained.</p><p>A handheld metal detector has been employed with variable success in locating coins, and can detect materials that are metallic but not radio-opaque, such as aluminum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. This instrument is less reliable in detecting metallic objects other than coins, limiting its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all patients with suspected foreign body ingestion, the initial diagnostic test should be biplane radiographs (anteroposterior and lateral) of the neck, chest, and abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/5,21,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21,61</a>]. We suggest that plain radiographs be performed even if the foreign body is thought to be radiolucent. This is to evaluate for the possibility of other swallowed objects; for indirect evidence of the radiolucent foreign body (such as an air-fluid level in the esophagus); and for free air representing a perforation. </p><p>Flat objects (eg, coins or disk batteries) usually orient in the coronal plane and appear as a circular object on an anteroposterior projection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76887\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76887 \">image 1</a>), whereas objects lodged in the trachea tend to orient in the sagittal plane and are best seen in lateral projection.

The lateral projection radiograph may help to identify the object or establish if more than one foreign body is present, such as stacked coins. Toys made of plastic or wood, some thin metal objects, and many types of bones are not readily seen on plain films [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/19,21,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,65</a>].

This distinction is most important when the foreign body is in the esophagus, since batteries require immediate removal whereas coins may or may not. Radiographic features that can help distinguish between the two are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52816\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52816 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77690\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77690 \">image 3</a>).

If the child is asymptomatic and the coin does not pass spontaneously by 24 hours after ingestion, it should be removed. In our practice, we prefer to remove most coins using flexible endoscopy. Rigid endoscopy or Magill forceps are acceptable approaches for proximally located coins, with experienced operators. The penny pincher or Foley catheter techniques are cost-effective alternatives for selected patients, but require fluoroscopy and do not allow direct inspection of the esophagus. Several case series have described effective management using bougienage to push the coin into the stomach for selected patients at low risk for complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/14,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,74,75</a>]. Patient selection and limitations of non-endoscopic techniques are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H2753069748\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> below.) </p><p>Because coins lack sharp edges and the metal is not toxic, coins that reach the stomach can be managed expectantly, and most will pass out uneventfully within one to two weeks. For these patients, most providers check the location of the coin with a plain radiograph about once a week. If the coin has not passed beyond the stomach by four weeks, endoscopic removal is recommended. If the child develops any signs or symptoms of obstruction, abdominal pain, vomiting, or fever, then the patient is promptly reevaluated with radiographs and the coin is removed endoscopically.

If the history or examination raises concern for a sharp-pointed object, endoscopy should be performed even if the radiologic exam is negative because many sharp-pointed objects are not readily visible by radiography.

The risk of mucosal injury during retrieval of a sharp object can be minimized by orienting the object with the sharp-end trailing during extraction and using a protector hood on the end of the endoscope, or (in older children) an overtube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. Direct laryngoscopy is a reasonable alternative for objects lodged at or above the cricopharyngeus. (See <a href=\"#H2215466185\" class=\"local\">'Flexible endoscopy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1507871802\" class=\"local\">'Magill forceps'</a> below.) </p><p>If the object is in the stomach or proximal duodenum, it also should be removed promptly, using a flexible endoscope.

In children presenting with a food impaction, there is a higher incidence of underlying esophageal pathology compared with children with other esophageal foreign bodies. (See <a href=\"#H4263157212\" class=\"local\">'Common foreign bodies'</a> above.)</p><p>Children who are in acute distress or unable to swallow oral secretions require immediate attention and removal of the impaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101288\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101288 \">algorithm 4</a>). If the patient is comfortable and able to handle oral secretions, endoscopic intervention can be delayed, as many food impactions will pass spontaneously.

A proteolytic enzyme is not recommended because its use has been associated with hypernatremia, erosion, esophageal perforation, and aspiration pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/4,86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,86,87</a>]. Glucagon is not recommended because of the lack of evidence of efficacy, particularly in children, and because nausea and vomiting are common side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>]. Although some authors have suggested that a bolus of intravenous glucagon may promote spontaneous passage of an impacted food bolus by relaxing the esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>], two small randomized trials and a large case series suggest that glucagon is no more effective than placebo, except perhaps in patients with a prior history of solid food dysphagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/88,92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,92,93</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The optimal approach to removal of a food bolus depends on the location and consistency. Objects in the upper esophagus may be optimally managed with a rigid endoscope, whereas those in more distal locations typically require flexible endoscopy. Some providers find that polypectomy snares or retrieval nets (eg, Roth Net), or a friction-fit adaptor (from a band ligator) fitted to the end of the endoscope are valuable for food bolus removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/24,94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,94,95</a>]. The food bolus can be removed en bloc or in a piecemeal fashion.

Because food impaction is often caused by an underlying mucosal abnormality such as esophagitis or stricture, we recommend that esophageal mucosal biopsies be obtained at the time of endoscopic disimpaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/4,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,97</a>].

Lactobezoars generally respond to conservative management, consisting of bowel rest, with or without saline lavage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>].

They include rigid and flexible endoscopy, bougienage, Foley catheterization of the esophagus, and the penny pincher technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2215466185\"><span class=\"h2\">Flexible endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flexible endoscopy is preferred in most circumstances because the foreign body can be directly visualized and manipulated, and the surrounding gastrointestinal tract can be examined for potential complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/1,5,7,14,94,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,7,14,94,110</a>]. This procedure is performed under conscious sedation or general anesthesia, depending upon the patient's age, ability to cooperate, and the type and number of objects to be removed. The endoscopist should have a complete array of equipment to grasp the foreign object, such as a rat-tooth and alligator forceps, polyp snare, retrieval net, and helical baskets. It is helpful to practice grasping a duplicate of the foreign body using the retrieval tools before beginning the procedure. A foreign body protector hood is the preferred method of protecting the esophagus if the object is sharp or pointed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1989508785\"><span class=\"h2\">Rigid endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rigid endoscopy utilizes a non-flexible channeled device that is introduced into the esophagus under general anesthesia. It is most useful for impacted sharp objects that are located in the proximal esophagus, at the level of the hypopharynx and cricopharyngeus muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. The technique requires considerable skill and may cause complications such as esophageal abrasion and perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/7,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,110</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1507871802\"><span class=\"h2\">Magill forceps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magill forceps can be used to extract foreign bodies impacted in the oropharynx or upper esophagus. In some cases, an object impacted in the upper esophageal sphincter is visible at the time of tracheal intubation and can be directly removed with the Magill forceps without the need for intubation. However, in most cases, an endotracheal tube is placed to protect the airway, and a laryngoscope is used to gently open the esophagus and visualize the foreign body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In one case series, esophageal coins were removed in 23 out of 36 patients using Magill forceps. In many of these cases, the extraction was performed easily although the coin was not visible with the laryngoscope. No complications were reported in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2673219974\"><span class=\"h2\">Bougienage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bougienage (passage of a dilator) has been used to push objects into the stomach. The procedure is less costly than endoscopy and can be performed without anesthesia or sedation. However, it does not retrieve the foreign body, and should only be considered for blunt and small objects that are likely to pass along the esophagus and into the stomach without causing significant mucosal injury (eg, coins). Moreover, because bougienage does not permit visualization of the esophagus, it will not identify children with undiagnosed esophageal disease (eg, eosinophilic esophagitis) that might have predisposed the object to become lodged in the esophagus. The use of this technique is thus limited and most endoscopists would only advocate this in experienced hands and only in selected cases, such as children with a witnessed coin ingestion of less than 24 hours duration and no known esophageal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/5,14,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,74,75</a>]. Many providers do not recommend bougienage at all if endoscopy is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>In one case series reporting successful use of bougienage for esophageal coins, selection criteria included radiographic confirmation of a single coin (without characteristics suspicious for button battery), presentation within 24 hours of ingestion, location below the clavicles and above the diaphragm, and without respiratory distress, esophageal abnormalities, gastrointestinal surgeries, or prior foreign body ingestions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4029189906\"><span class=\"h2\">Foley catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For this technique, a deflated Foley catheter is passed beyond the foreign body. The balloon is then inflated using a radio-opaque contrast dye, and the catheter is slowly drawn back under fluoroscopic guidance, to remove the foreign body through the mouth. The technique can be successful with proximal esophageal foreign bodies when performed by an experienced operator. It does not permit visualization of the esophagus and carries the risk of esophageal perforation if the balloon is inflated below a stricture. In addition, this approach may cause aspiration of the foreign body if it is inadvertently dragged into the trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For these reasons, many providers do not recommend this technique if endoscopy is available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H851384224\"><span class=\"h2\">Penny pincher technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The penny pincher technique involves insertion of a grasping forceps through a nasogastric tube, under fluoroscopic guidance and usually without anesthesia or endotracheal intubation. This approach is an improvement over the Foley catheter method because it permits direct control of the object, reducing the risk of dropping it into the airway. However, it also does not allow inspection of the esophagus and should only be used for objects that can be firmly grasped and controlled by the forceps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, The Basics and Beyond the Basics.

When symptoms do occur, they may include a sensation of something stuck in the chest, refusal of feeds or dysphagia, drooling, or respiratory symptoms including wheezing, stridor, or choking. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with long-standing esophageal foreign bodies may present with weight loss, aspiration pneumonia, fever, or signs and symptoms of esophageal perforation including crepitus, pneumomediastinum, or gastrointestinal bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of a patient with suspected foreign body ingestion should include biplane radiographs (anteroposterior and lateral) of the neck, chest, and abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57363\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57363 \">algorithm 1</a>). Other imaging modalities or direct advancement to upper endoscopy may be helpful in identifying radiolucent foreign bodies. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urgent and sometimes emergent intervention to remove a foreign body is indicated in the following situations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57363\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57363 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Urgent intervention'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When the object is sharp, long, or consists of magnets or a superabsorbent polymer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When the object is a disk battery in the esophagus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If airway compromise, such as tracheal compression, is present</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If there is evidence of esophageal obstruction (eg, the patient is unable to swallow secretions)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If there are signs or symptoms suggesting inflammation or intestinal obstruction (fever, abdominal pain, or vomiting)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the object is in the esophagus and the suspected ingestion occurred 24 or more hours prior to the evaluation, or if the time of ingestion is unknown</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected magnet ingestion requires urgent evaluation. Management depends on the timing, location, type, and number of magnets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83942%7EPEDS%2F86069\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef83942 graphicRef86069 \">algorithm 2A-B</a>). Single magnets can generally be managed conservatively, but with precautions. Ingestion of multiple magnets has a high risk of complications and warrants preemptive removal. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Magnets'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without the above characteristics who are comfortable and able to handle oral secretions, intervention can be delayed for up to 24 hours. Coins, food impactions, and other blunt objects often will pass spontaneously into the stomach and beyond. Recommendations for removal of disk batteries that are in the stomach depend on the timing of ingestion and composition of the battery, and are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Expectant management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Batteries'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Button and cylindrical battery ingestion: Clinical features, diagnosis, and initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of techniques are used to extract foreign bodies from the esophagus or stomach. We suggest flexible endoscopy for most foreign body extractions (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This preference is because the technique can be adapted to a variety of foreign bodies in the esophagus, stomach, or proximal duodenum, and allows direct assessment of the mucosa for injury. Rigid endoscopy or retrieval with Magill forceps are useful techniques for objects in the hypopharynx or proximal esophagus. (See <a href=\"#H2753069748\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend prompt removal of any sharp object in the esophagus (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>) or proximal gastrointestinal tract (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101287\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101287 \">algorithm 3</a>). This is because of high rates of complications from sharp objects. For the same reason, we recommend prompt removal of magnets if more than one is present in the proximal gastrointestinal tract (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). If these objects have passed beyond the proximal duodenum and the patient is asymptomatic, they can be managed with close observation and serial radiographs. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Sharp-pointed objects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Magnets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a food bolus impaction who are in acute distress or unable to swallow oral secretions require immediate attention and removal of the impaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101288\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101288 \">algorithm 4</a>). If the patient is comfortable and able to handle oral secretions, endoscopic intervention can be delayed for up to 24 hours. If endoscopy is performed, esophageal mucosal biopsies should be obtained to evaluate for an underlying mucosal abnormality such as esophagitis or stricture. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal food impaction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Objects that have passed beyond the proximal duodenum are not accessible to the endoscope, and most will pass without complications. The progress of radio-opaque objects down the gastrointestinal tract should be monitored with serial radiographs.
