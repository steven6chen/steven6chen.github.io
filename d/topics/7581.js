It stores bile, a fluid that helps the body break down fat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464403502\"><span class=\"h1\">What are gallstones?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gallstones are small stones that form inside the gallbladder. They can be tiny specks or get as big as the whole gallbladder, which can be up to 6 inches long.</p><p>Normally, the gallbladder fills with bile in between meals. Then, when you eat fatty foods, the gallbladder empties the bile into the intestine. Sometimes, though, gallstones clog the gallbladder and keep it from draining. Other times, gallstones just irritate the gallbladder. If the gallstones are pushed out of the gallbladder, they can keep the liver or pancreas from draining.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464403509\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of gallstones?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, gallstones do not cause any symptoms. When they do cause symptoms, gallstones can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain &ndash; Often on the right side just under the rib cage or in the middle top portion of the belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the back or right shoulder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p/><p>If you know that you have gallstones but have no symptoms, you probably will not need treatment. But if you start having symptoms, you should get treated. The symptoms can come and go, but they often get worse over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464403516\"><span class=\"h1\">Are gallstones serious?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not usually. In rare cases they can lead to serious problems, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaundice, a condition that turns your skin and eyes yellow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection of the gallbladder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tears in the gallbladder, which can lead to death</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation of the pancreas (the pancreas is an organ that makes hormones and juices involved in food breakdown)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464403523\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for gallstones?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, doctors can find out if you have gallstones by doing an imaging test, such as an ultrasound. An ultrasound is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a picture of your gallbladder.</p><p>Even if tests show that you have gallstones, that does not mean they are causing symptoms. Your doctor might need to do other tests to make sure your stones and your symptoms are related.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464403530\"><span class=\"h1\">How are gallstones treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with gallstones generally have 3 treatment options. They can have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>No treatment</strong> &ndash; This option is best for people with no symptoms. If they start having symptoms, they can think about treatment then.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery to remove the gallbladder and the stones</strong> &ndash; Gallbladder surgery is routine in the United States. But it involves using anesthesia, so it has some risks. The surgery does not affect digestion very much. But about half the people who have surgery have mild symptoms afterward, including watery bowel movements, gas, or bloating. These symptoms usually get better. People who have their gallbladder removed do not need to worry about gallstones coming back.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatment to get rid of the stones but keep the gallbladder</strong> &ndash; People who choose this approach can take medicines to break up gallstones or be treated with a device that breaks up stones (or both). These treatments can work, but they take time &ndash; months to years. People with severe symptoms might not want to wait that long to feel better. Plus, the stones can come back after these treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464403537\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know which treatment to have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right treatment for you will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How large your stones are</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you have symptoms, and how bad the symptoms are</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How you feel about the treatment options</p><p/><p>Ask your doctor or nurse how each treatment might affect you. Then work with him or her to find the treatment that makes the most sense for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464403544\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to keep from getting (more) gallstones?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can try to keep yourself at a healthy weight. People who are overweight are more likely to get gallstones.</p><p>If you plan to lose weight quickly &ndash; even if you have never had gallstones &ndash; ask your doctor or nurse what you can do to keep from getting gallstones. Losing weight quickly &ndash; for example, through weight loss surgery &ndash; can lead to gallstones. But your doctor or nurse can give you medicines to keep that from happening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464403551\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pancreatitis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallstones-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gallstones (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
