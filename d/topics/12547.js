Elevated homocysteine appears to be associated with an increased risk of the large artery subtype of ischemic stroke, and possibly to the small artery subtype; it does not appear to be associated with cardioembolic or other stroke subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-secondary-prevention-of-ischemic-stroke/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Unfortunately, there is evidence from several clinical trials that treatment with homocysteine-reducing vitamins is <strong>not</strong> beneficial for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease or stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-secondary-prevention-of-ischemic-stroke/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration is associated with the long-term risk of cardiovascular events, including ischemic stroke, as confirmed by a meta-analysis of 54 prospective studies and individual records from over 160,000 subjects without a history of vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-secondary-prevention-of-ischemic-stroke/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. While elevated CRP levels could be used as an additional marker of increased stroke risk, there are no randomized clinical trial data to support the hypothesis that lowering CRP levels will lead to reduced stroke risk. Furthermore, appropriate critical thresholds of CRP elevation and optimal timing of CRP measurements in the setting of acute cerebral ischemia have not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-secondary-prevention-of-ischemic-stroke/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Therefore, we do not recommend routinely checking CRP levels for primary or secondary ischemic stroke prevention. Leukocyte counts and neutrophil counts were associated with ischemic events including stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death in a high-risk population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-secondary-prevention-of-ischemic-stroke/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In the week before the recurrent event, the leukocyte count was significantly increased over baseline levels.

An independent association of leukocyte count elevation with increased ischemic stroke risk was also found among stroke-free participants in a prospective, longitudinal, cohort study (the Northern Manhattan Study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-secondary-prevention-of-ischemic-stroke/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Furthermore, the utility of the metabolic syndrome to predict stroke risk does not appear to improve upon more conventional assessments such as the Framingham Risk Score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-secondary-prevention-of-ischemic-stroke/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

It is unknown whether patients with central sleep apnea syndrome, including Cheyne-Stokes breathing, also have an increased risk. Limited data suggest that the presence of sleep-related breathing disorders following a stroke may be a marker of a poorer long-term outcome. Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy and behavioral modifications are the mainstays of treatment for patients diagnosed with sleep-related breathing disorders. This is reviewed elsewhere.

Radiotherapy-related occlusive disease is often diffuse and occurs in uncommon locations, in contrast to the typical focal lesions that develop at vessel bifurcations from atherosclerosis in the absence of radiation. Depending on the site and dose of radiation, the involved vessels may include the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries and the intracranial circle of Willis vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-secondary-prevention-of-ischemic-stroke/abstract/75,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,78</a>].

Long-term anticoagulation should be considered as prevention for patients with chronic nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who have had an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. While the benefit outweighs the risk in most patients, careful consideration of the risk to benefit ratio is necessary in those at relatively low risk. (See <a href=\"#H231824703\" class=\"local\">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with TIA or ischemic stroke of atherosclerotic origin who are able to tolerate statins, we suggest high-intensity statin therapy, independent of the baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), to reduce the risk of stroke and cardiovascular events (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We suggest treating with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> since this was the agent and dose used in the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial that showed a benefit for secondary ischemic stroke prevention. For patients who are intolerant of high-intensity statin therapy, alternatives are moderate-intensity statin therapy (eg, atorvastatin 10 to 20 mg daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a> 5 to 10 mg daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> 20 to 40 mg daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pravastatin</a> 40 to 80 mg daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lovastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lovastatin</a> 40 mg daily, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvastatin</a> 40 mg daily in two divided doses) or low-intensity statin therapy (eg, pravastatin 10 to 20 mg daily or lovastatin 20 mg daily). For patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who are intolerant of even low-intensity statin therapy, we suggest treatment with another class of lipid lowering agent.
