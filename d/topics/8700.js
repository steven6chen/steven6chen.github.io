Measures to prevent recurrent reactions to RCM in patients with past IHRs will be discussed in this topic review. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of IHRs are discussed separately.

The recommendations described here are only intended for prevention of recurrent IHRs.</p><p>IHRs to RCM develop within one hour of administration, and many begin within five minutes. IHRs have signs and symptoms that are similar or identical to those of anaphylaxis, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flushing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pruritus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urticaria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioedema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchospasm and wheezing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngeal edema and stridor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension and rarely shock</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of consciousness</p><p/><p>RCM can also cause delayed reactions, which are defined as reactions beginning from one hour to several days after administration.

Other antihistamines have not been studied in this setting.</p><p/><p>An observational study examined the efficacy of this premedication regimen in 657 procedures performed in &gt;500 patients with previous IHRs and found that premedication using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> reduced the rate of breakthrough reactions from a historical level of 17 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>], down to 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Premedication was effective regardless of the severity of the initial reaction, although it is likely that the most severe reactors were not entered into this protocol. Of note, this study was performed at a time when hyperosmolal contrast agents, which are associated with higher rates of IHRs, were more commonly used, so the rates of recurrent reactions with modern agents may be even lower.</p><p>The administration of two doses of glucocorticoids 12 and 2 hours before the procedure was more effective than just one dose 2 hours before, which is consistent with the pharmacology of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ephedrine</a> was also given in early reports, but it is uncommonly used now, due to multiple contraindications and weak evidence that it reduces reactivity substantially beyond the two drug regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The benefit of adding H2 antihistamines to regimens of H1 antihistamines and glucocorticoids is not established, and the authors do not routinely administer H2 antihistamines for premedication.

However, two other reports found that the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a> to regimens containing H1 antihistamines and glucocorticoids did not reduce the number of subsequent adverse reactions further [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of radiocontrast agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Readministration of contrast to patients with history of IHRs should occur in a clinical setting capable of managing emergent IHRs. The choice of agent depends upon what type of agent caused the patient's previous reaction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who developed IHRs to high osmolal contrast material (HOCM) agents in the past, we suggest a nonionic low osmolal contrast material (LOCM) be used for future procedures, in combination with premedications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to a LOCM in the past, we weigh the need for contrast administration against the history of the IHR severity. If contrast is necessary, LOCM should be administered, in combination with premedications. In patients with history of moderate or severe IHR, the LOCM agent given should be different (if available) from the one that previously caused the reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83944 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In patients with a history of mild IHR, the risk of a repeated episode is low, and the type of LOCM used does not appear to influence this risk.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Categories of agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The various types of RCM are most commonly categorized by osmolality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66974\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66974 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83944 \">table 2</a>). HOCM agents have osmolalities &ge;1400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosm/kg</span> and LOCM agents have osmolalities between 500 and 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosm/kg</span>. The lowest osmolality agents are iso-osmolal agents, which are isotonic relative to serum (approximately 290 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span>.</p><p>Four categories can be distinguished if the agents are further subdivided based upon the charge of the iodinated molecule and the molecular structure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66974\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66974 \">algorithm 1</a>). Most agents belong to just two groups: ionic HOCM agents or nonionic LOCM agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Low or iso-osmolal contrast agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LOCM agents cause significantly fewer IHRs compared with HOCM, and nonionic LOCM agents are recommended for any patient with a previous IHR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. By extension, we would also suggest consideration of an iso-osmolal agent. The incidence of IHRs associated with each type of RCM is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Incidence of reactions by type of RCM'</a>.)</p><p>In most centers, use of nonionic LOCM agents for all intravascular procedures has become a widespread practice as the cost differential between LOCM and HOCM has decreased, and with the realization that evaluating, observing, and treating even minor reactions has hidden costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The effect of using iso-osmolal agents in patients with past IHRs to LOCM has not been specifically studied, although some information may be extrapolated from IHR rates in the general population. The rate of IHRs is significantly lower with the use of the iso-osmolal RCM <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodixanol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iodixanol</a> (Visipaque) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In a randomized parallel-group double-blind study, 1411 patients received either ioxaglate (<strong>ionic</strong> LOCM) or iodixanol (iso-osmolal) for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The rate of IHRs was significantly lower with iodixanol (0.7 versus 2.5 percent). However, the higher cost of this agent has prevented its widespread use in patients at lower risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. A direct comparison between a <strong>non</strong>ionic LOCM and an iso-osmolal agent is needed for a more definitive recommendation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Gadolinium-based agents used in MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gadolinium chelates are the contrast used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and represent a different molecular class than the iodinated contrast agents used with x-ray-based imaging (eg radiography, computed tomography [CT], fluoroscopy). There is no cross-reactivity between the two classes of contrast agents. That is, a prior reaction to gadolinium-based contrast does not predict a future reaction to iodinated contrast medium or vice versa more than any other unrelated allergy.</p><p>Gadolinium-based contrast is classified by the chemical structure of the chelator, which can be either linear or macrocyclic and ionic or nonionic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. All classes of agents are widely available and used. The choice varies with the imaging practice and the recommendations of the regulatory agencies within which they practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The risk versus benefit analysis for this choice continues to evolve with emerging data on the rates of severe allergy, of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with chronic kidney disease, and of long-term gadolinium deposition in the body. Each of these risks are differentially associated with the molecular class of gadolinium.</p><p>The overall rate of IHRs is 92 in 100,000 gadolinium contrast administrations. The rate of severe IHRs is 5.2 in 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Severe IHRs are characterized by life-threatening symptoms, such as hypoxia from bronchospasm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laryngeal edema, hypotension, and shock. Most IHRs to gadolinium contrast are mild, involving transient urticaria or nasal congestion or moderate, involving urticaria or hoarseness without hypoxia. Lower rates of IHRs are observed with ionic rather than nonionic, linear rather than macrocyclic, and a low rather than high protein-binding molecular class of gadolinium contrast. However, the risk of gadolinium deposition and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is likely higher with linear rather than macrocyclic agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'MR contrast agent'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;, section on 'If gadolinium must be given'</a>.)</p><p>Case reports and small series suggest that skin testing with gadolinium agents after an IHR may be useful in identifying alternative gadolinium-based agents that will be tolerated for future use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Epicutaneous (prick) skin testing with the undiluted preparation, followed if negative by intradermal testing with a 1:10 dilution, was recommended by the 2013 European Network on Drug Allergy and European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ENDA/EAACI)</span> position paper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The positive predictive value is not known, since this would require deliberately exposing patients with potential allergy, but the negative predictive value appears to be clinically useful. In small series of patients, negative skin tests identified alternative gadolinium-based agents that the patients subsequently received without reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H422997031\"><span class=\"h3\">Carbon dioxide alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbon dioxide is an alternative contrast for abdominal and lower extremity angiography and upper extremity venographic when iodinated contrast media is contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1582264\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO PATIENTS REQUIRING REPEAT CONTRAST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The required precautionary measures and the oral and intravenous premedication regimens for iodinated contrast administration in patients with a history of IHRs are described elsewhere. In patients with a history to IHRs to gadolinium contrast, the approach is analogous to that used for iodinated contrast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59096\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59096 \">table 1</a>).

In the past, skin testing was not recommended, but several studies have raised the possibility that it may be helpful in the evaluation of patients with severe past IHRs if performed within a window of a few months after the reaction. At the time of this review, the American College of Radiology and an American Drug Allergy Practice Parameter do not endorse skin testing with RCM, while a European position paper on drug allergy does [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/26,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30,31</a>]. The authors and editors of UpToDate believe that the role of skin testing remains undefined because several important issues have not been adequately resolved.</p><p>Until more data are available, we would consider skin testing in the specific situation of a patient with a recent anaphylactic reaction to RCM who requires another procedure with RCM in the near future. In this situation, the results of skin testing are used to select an agent to which the patient does not react on testing and therefore <strong>may be</strong> less likely to react, for use in future radiologic tests. This approach might also be helpful in patients with recurrent (ie, &quot;breakthrough&quot;) reactions despite precautions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28566536\"><span class=\"h2\">Issues concerning skin testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues concerning skin testing with RCM are outlined in the discussion that follows.</p><p>There is universal consensus that routinely skin testing all patients with past IHRs is <strong>not</strong> an effective means of preventing recurrent reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/3,4,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,32</a>]. In one large study, skin testing was performed prospectively in 270,991 patients who were about to receive intravascular RCM injections. The predictive value and sensitivity of skin testing was 1.2 and 3.7 percent, for ionic RCM, and 0 and 0 percent for nonionic RCM, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, routine skin testing was not useful in predicting the vast majority of reactions.</p><p>In contrast, consensus is lacking about whether skin testing might be helpful in evaluating patients with <strong>severe</strong> IHRs in the recent past, who have a need for additional RCM-requiring studies in the near future. The following studies support an association between skin test reactivity (at high testing concentrations) and recent severe reactions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 4 percent of 96 patients with severe immediate reactions to RCM had positive skin tests to the RCM agent that caused their IHR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This study evaluated patients who had experienced severe IHRs to iodinated contrast material, by performing intradermal skin with the culprit RCM agent, as well as four commonly used agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=iopamidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iopamidol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iopromide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iopromide</a>, iomeprol, and iopentol [the latter two agents are not available in the United States] at concentrations of 61 to 66 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Evaluation took place within one year of the reaction in 71 percent of subjects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Only 4 of 96 patients had positive (defined as a wheal greater than 3 mm) intradermal skin tests to one or more agents, and in all four, the agent that caused the previous reaction yielded a positive result. These patients had all experienced significant respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal signs and symptoms within 10 minutes of receiving intravenous contrast agents. Basophil activation tests were then performed with the cells of these four patients and produced results that matched the skin test results. Finally, two of the four patients consented to be challenged with a RCM to which skin testing and basophil activation tests were negative, and both tolerated doses of 50 mL. One of these two patients was subsequently given the culprit agent again for a future computed tomography (CT) scan (presumably by mistake), despite the results of the evaluation. Even with premedication, the patients suffered a moderate-grade IHR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter study evaluated 122 patients with past IHRs and found a much higher rate of skin test positivity among patients who were tested within a few months of their reactions. Skin testing was performed with the culprit RCM if known, as well as several other commonly used agents. Positive intradermal skin tests were seen in 26 percent of patients with IHRs, compared with 0 of 11 exposed controls and 3 of 71 unexposed controls. Patients were statistically more likely to have positive skin test results if tested within two to six months of their reactions (14 of 28 or 50 percent positive), compared with longer or shorter periods of time (17 of 92 or 18 percent positive) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Unlike the study discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], skin tests to the culprit agent were positive in 86 percent of the 28 cases in which the culprit RCM was known, indicating that sensitivity may be relatively high, at least when the evaluation is done promptly. In the overall group with positive skin tests, 43 percent had experienced the IHR during their first known exposure to RCM, which suggests that patients may become sensitized to RCM through exposure to a different but related substance, similar to observations in patients allergic to muscle relaxants. Alternatively skin test positivity to RCM may be unrelated to immunologic sensitivity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-management#H315537455\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management&quot;, section on 'Neuromuscular-blocking agents'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series of 38 patients with past IHRs found a similarly high rate of positive skin test results to the culprit agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The time elapsed between the reaction and skin testing was not reported. In this study, the causative RCMs were known in each case, and skin testing was performed in 27 patients, with positive results in 19 (74 percent). Among those with positive skin tests, 5 had reacted to their first known exposure to RCM, confirming the findings of the previously mentioned study. Intradermal testing was performed with multiple dilutions, including undiluted RCM. Among the 19 with positive skin tests, 7 patients reacted to the agent that had caused their reaction only at the undiluted strength. In contrast, when patients were then tested with 10 other RCM agents, only 9 of 188 tests to undiluted RCM were positive, suggesting that a positive result to undiluted material was not due to nonspecific irritation. An incidental finding in this study was that histamine and tryptase elevations (drawn at the time of the reaction) were more likely in patients with life-threatening reactions involving cardiovascular symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 51 patients with RCM-induced anaphylaxis, 65 percent had positive skin testing to the culprit agent; among patients with anaphylaxis with hypotension, 82 percent had positive skin tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p>When evaluating these studies, it is important to note that the ability of a skin test reagent to elicit a positive skin test does not prove that the patient has an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy to that agent, but rather demonstrates that the agent has the ability to cause immediate release of inflammatory mediators from cutaneous mast cells in that patient. This information is only clinically meaningful if a positive test reliably distinguishes between patients who react to that agent and those who tolerate it, and this has not been established for RCM. There are very few reported instances in which subjects with positive skin tests were rechallenged, for obvious ethical reasons. It is possible that the positive skin test results in the above studies reflect sequelae of the reactions that are not clinically significant or predictive of future reactivity. This is suggested by the brief window of time in which positive skin tests were demonstrable (ie, the few months following the initial severe hypersensitivity reaction), which is not typical of true IgE-mediated drug allergy. In other well-studied forms of IgE-mediated allergy (ie, penicillin) positive skin tests are present for several years after a reaction. In addition, the fact that positive results were obtained only with relatively high concentrations of RCM is also not characteristic of true IgE-mediated drug allergy, which is usually demonstrable with even very dilute testing solutions. Finally, the optimal control patient in such studies would be individuals who recently tolerated RCM (within the past few months based upon the study above), but this patient population can be difficult to recruit. Instead, patients who tolerated RCM years earlier or who are RCM-na&iuml;ve are often used as controls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362394169\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of skin testing and allergy evaluation for severe IHRs to RCM is controversial, as discussed above. Skin testing practices at different institutions vary and evidence is lacking about whether a skin testing based approach is superior to the combination of premedication and use of the lowest possible osmolal RCM available. (See <a href=\"#H4554678\" class=\"local\">'Allergy evaluation for past severe reactions'</a> above.)</p><p>If skin testing is pursued, it should be performed by allergy experts experienced in drug allergy and trained in treating acute allergic reactions, since there is a very small risk of systemic allergic reactions to the testing itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362394028\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin testing techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intradermal skin testing with RCM agents is the method of choice if skin testing is pursued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. In contrast, the epicutaneous or prick method of skin testing is not sufficiently sensitive to detect agents causing immediate reactions, although it is performed prior to intradermal testing to detect the rare extremely sensitive patient who is at risk for a systemic reaction with intradermal testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Ideally, skin testing should be performed within two to six months of the original reaction, as the incidence of positive skin tests appears to be lower before and after this time period, as reviewed previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. We would suggest testing the patient with the agent that caused the previous reaction, as well as several possible alternative agents. Discussion with the radiologist to identify possible alternative agents is helpful.</p><p>The optimal concentration for intradermal skin testing has not been determined.

The clinician should bear in mind that it has not been established that a negative skin test result can reliably predict that the patient will tolerate the RCM in question, although at present, there is no other way to assess this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">BREAKTHROUGH REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No intervention completely eliminates the risk of a breakthrough immediate hypersensitivity reaction (IHR), and reactions do occur despite premedication and use of a different radiocontrast media (RCM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/5-7,9,33,41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,9,33,41-44</a>].
