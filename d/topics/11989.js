In addition, some patients eventually require pharmacologic therapy or bariatric surgery. The risk of overweight to the patient should be evaluated before beginning any treatment program (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70466 \">table 1</a>). Selection of treatment can then be made using a risk-benefit assessment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F93424\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93424 \">algorithm 1</a>). The choice of therapy is dependent on several factors, including the degree of overweight or obesity, comorbidities, and patient preference.</p><p>This topic will review the dietary therapy of obesity.

The clinician should review with the patient the importance of weight loss on physical, mental, and functional health; assist the patient with developing a plan of action; and provide support with each stage of the process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss of 5 to 7 percent of body weight carries numerous health benefits and should be sought as an initial weight loss goal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss of more than 5 percent can reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.</p><p/><p>In the Diabetes Prevention Program, a multicenter trial in patients with impaired glucose tolerance, intensive lifestyle modification aimed at a weight loss of 7 percent reduced the rate of progression from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes by 58 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Diabetes Prevention Program'</a>.)</p><p>In Look AHEAD (<strong>A</strong>ction for <strong>Hea</strong>lth in <strong>D</strong>iabetes), a multicenter trial in patients with type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> an intensive lifestyle intervention aimed at achieving and maintaining a loss of at least 7 percent of initial body weight improved glycemic control significantly better than standard therapy with fewer medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The use of antihypertensive medications, statins, and insulin was lower in the intervention group. However, the primary major atherosclerotic event outcome was not significantly reduced compared with the control group. Noncardiac benefits of the lifestyle intervention included reductions in urinary incontinence, sleep apnea, and depression and improvements in quality of life, physical functioning, sexual functioning, and mobility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H6062398\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Intensive lifestyle modification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RATE OF WEIGHT LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of weight loss is directly related to the difference between the individual's energy intake and energy requirements. Reducing caloric intake below expenditure should result in a predictable initial rate of weight loss that is related to the energy deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. However, prediction of weight loss for an individual can be difficult because there is a range of weight loss with all diets. Factors that predict response to a diet include dietary adherence and genetic factors influencing body composition and energy expenditure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men lose more weight than women of similar height and weight when they comply with eating a given diet because men generally have more lean body mass, less percent body fat, and, therefore, higher energy expenditure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older individuals of either gender have a lower energy expenditure and, therefore, lose weight more slowly than younger individuals; metabolic rate declines by approximately 2 percent per decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>Initial rate of weight loss may be a marker of longer-term success. In the Look AHEAD (<strong>A</strong>ction for <strong>Hea</strong>lth in <strong>D</strong>iabetes) trial, individuals in the highest compared with the lowest tertile of weight loss after one and two months were more likely to achieve &ge;5 percent weight loss at year 8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>There are several methods of formally estimating energy expenditure; we suggest using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63308\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63308 \">table 2</a>). This method allows a direct estimate of resting metabolic rate (RMR) and calculation of daily energy requirement. The low activity level (1.3 x RMR) includes individuals who lead a sedentary life. The high activity level (1.7 x RMR) applies to those in jobs requiring manual labor or patients with regular daily physical exercise programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Approximately 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> is required to maintain a kilogram of body weight in a normal-weight adult. Thus, the expected or calculated energy expenditure for a woman weighing 100 kg is approximately 2200 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span>. The variability of &plusmn;20 percent could give energy needs as high as 2620 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> or as low as 1860 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span>. An average deficit of 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> should result in an initial weight loss of approximately 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/week</span> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">lb/week)</span>. However, after three to six months of weight loss, loss of lean mass slows the body weight response to the initial change in energy intake, thereby diminishing ongoing weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. For weight loss to continue, further caloric restriction or increased caloric expenditure (for example, through increased activity levels) must ensue following weight plateau.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3015863186\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2112999873\"><span class=\"h2\">General advice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To implement a successful dietary intervention, we typically perform a brief 24-hour dietary recall during the office visit. We counsel patients on the importance of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elimination of all caloric beverages, which are often the source of unwanted calories, and processed foods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Portion control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-monitoring</p><p/><p>Self-monitoring, often involving the use of food diaries, activity records, and self-weighing, is one of the elements of a successful behavioral weight loss program. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Behavioral therapy&quot;, section on 'Elements of behavioral strategies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4190314114\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general consensus is that excess intake of calories from any source, associated with a sedentary lifestyle, causes weight gain and obesity. The goal of dietary therapy, therefore, is to reduce the total number of calories consumed. We suggest choosing a dietary pattern of healthful foods, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or Mediterranean-style diet, rather than focusing on a specific nutrient. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Balanced low-calorie diets'</a> below.)</p><p>Diets which emphasize reductions in refined carbohydrates, processed meats, and foods high in sodium and trans fat; moderation in unprocessed red meats, poultry, eggs, and milk; and high intakes of fruits, nuts, fish, vegetables, vegetable oils, minimally processed whole grains, legumes, and yogurt are preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This approach allows greater flexibility and personal preference in diet and may improve long-term adherence.</p><p>Very low carbohydrate diets (eg, Atkins) appear more effective than other diets (eg, low glycemic load [eg, Zone], very low fat [eg, Ornish], or low-fat [eg, LEARN diets]) for up to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the optimal mix of macronutrients for longer-term weight loss or weight loss maintenance is unknown and likely depends upon individual factors. These factors may include gene-diet interactions and baseline insulin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, in a trial of 609 overweight adults who were randomly assigned to a healthy low-fat diet or a healthy low-carbohydrate diet, there was no interaction between weight loss and genotype pattern (low-fat sensitive or low-carbohydrate sensitive) or baseline insulin secretion levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A principal determinant of weight loss appears to be the degree of adherence to the diet, irrespective of the particular macronutrient composition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/13,16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16-21</a>]. However, in one randomized trial, the opportunity to choose rather than be assigned to a diet did not improve adherence or weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, in addition to patient choice, we suggest behavioral modification to improve dietary compliance with any type of diet. Behavioral modification may have the greatest impact on long-term weight loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Behavioral therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H573160486\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of macronutrient composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of specific dietary composition on weight change remains uncertain. When energy from dietary carbohydrates decreases, energy from fat or protein sources must increase. The reverse is also true; when energy from dietary fats decreases, energy from carbohydrate or protein sources increases. The debate has mainly centered on whether low-fat or low-carbohydrate diets can better induce weight loss and sustain it over the long term. However, the success of such diets may be dependent upon the type of carbohydrates or the types of fat that are consumed. In addition, it is important to keep in mind that total weight lost, rather than the macronutrient composition used to achieve it, is the major determinant of health benefits.</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 48 randomized trials (7286 individuals) comparing different dietary programs (predominantly low-carbohydrate, moderate macronutrient, or low-fat) with a comparator (no diet or competing dietary program), all diet programs resulted in significant weight loss (approximately 6 to 8 kg at six months) compared with no diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. At 12-month follow-up, the average weight losses of all diet programs were 1 to 2 kg less than at six-month follow-up. Weight loss differences between individual diets were minimal.</p><p>Individual trials and meta-analyses specifically comparing low-fat with low-carbohydrate or very low carbohydrate diets have conflicting results with regard to the impact of macronutrient composition on weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/15,24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24-29</a>]. In a systematic review of five trials with follow-up &ge;12 months, a Mediterranean diet resulted in similar weight loss (-4.1 to -10.1 kg) as a low-carbohydrate diet (-4.7 to -7.7 kg) and greater weight loss than a low-fat diet (2.9 to -5 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. There was wide variation in weight loss across trials, within individual diets, and between people for individual diets.</p><p>The following observations illustrate the range of findings in the individual trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, 322 moderately obese participants (86 percent men) were randomly assigned to a low-fat (restricted calorie), Mediterranean (moderate-fat, restricted calorie, rich in vegetables, low in red meat), or low-carbohydrate (nonrestricted calorie) diet for two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Adherence rates were higher than those reported in previous trials (95.4 and 84.6 percent at one and two years, respectively). Weight loss was greater with the Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets than the low-fat diet (mean weight loss 4.4, 4.7, and 2.9 kg, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among patients with type 2 diabetes, the greatest improvement in glycemic control occurred with the Mediterranean diet. Among all groups, weight loss was greater for those who completed the two-year study than for those who withdrew.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another randomized trial compared four different diets in 311 overweight and obese premenopausal women: very low carbohydrate (Atkins); macronutrient balance controlling glycemic load (Zone); general calorie restriction, low-fat (LEARN); and very low fat (Ornish) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In the intention-to-treat analysis at one year, mean weight loss was greater in the Atkins diet group compared with the other groups (4.7, 1.6, 2.2, and 2.6 kg, respectively). Pairwise comparisons showed a significant difference only for Atkins versus Zone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dietary adherence rates (77 to 88 percent) were similar among the groups and better than in previous trials. Within each group, adherence was significantly associated with weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest trial to date, 811 overweight and obese adults were randomly assigned to one of four diets based upon macronutrient content: low or high fat (20 to 40 percent), which provided carbohydrate at 35, 45, 55, or 65 percent, and average- or high-protein (15 to 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. After six months, mean weight loss in each group was 6 kg. By two years, mean weight loss was 3 to 4 kg, and weight losses remained similar in all groups. Many participants had trouble attaining target levels of macronutrients. Individuals who attended the greatest number of group sessions (most adherent) lost the most weight.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF DIETS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional diets are defined as those with energy requirements above 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These diets fall into the following groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balanced low-calorie diets and low-calorie versions of healthy diets (eg, Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] diets)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-fat diets</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-carbohydrate and low glycemic index diets</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-protein diets</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very low calorie diets</p><p/><p>Fad diets (diets involving unusual combinations of foods or eating sequences) are extremely popular but only for a short period of time.

It is desirable to eat foods with adequate nutrients in addition to protein, carbohydrate, and essential fatty acids. Thus, weight-reducing diets should eliminate alcohol, sugar-containing beverages, and most highly concentrated sweets because they may not contain adequate amounts of other nutrients besides energy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Portion-controlled meals</strong> &ndash; One simple approach to providing a calorie-controlled diet is to use individually packaged foods, such as formula diet drinks using powdered or liquid formula diets, nutrition bars, frozen food, and prepackaged meals that can be stored at room temperature as the main source of nutrients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Frozen, low-calorie meals containing 250 to 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/package</span> can be a convenient and nutritious way to do this. We have often recommended the use of formula diets or breakfast bars for breakfast; formula diets or a frozen lunch entree for lunch; and a frozen, calorie-controlled entree with additional vegetables for dinner. In this way, it is possible to obtain a calorie-controlled 1000 to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> diet. In one four-year study, this approach resulted in early initial weight loss, which then was maintained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low-calorie versions of healthy</strong> <strong>diets</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The term Mediterranean diet refers to a dietary pattern that is common in olive-growing areas of the Mediterranean. Although there is some variation in Mediterranean diets, there are some common components, which include a high level of monounsaturated fat relative to saturated fat; moderate consumption of alcohol, mainly as wine; a high consumption of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and grains; a moderate consumption of milk and dairy products, mostly in the form of cheese; and a relatively low intake of meat and meat products.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The Mediterranean diet appears to be associated with several health benefits, including cardiovascular risk reduction and diabetes prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

This was illustrated by the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial of 48,835 postmenopausal women over age 50 years, who were randomly assigned to a dietary intervention that included group and individual sessions to promote a decrease in fat intake and increases in fruit, vegetable, and whole grains but did not include weight loss or caloric restriction goals, or to a control group that received only dietary educational materials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. After an average of 7.5 years of follow-up, the following results were seen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women in the intervention group lost weight in the first year (mean of 2.2 kg) and maintained lower weight than the control women at 7.5 years (difference of 1.9 kg at one year, and 0.4 kg at 7.5 years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No tendency toward weight gain was seen in the intervention group overall or when stratified by age, ethnicity, or body mass index (BMI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss was related to the level of fat intake and was greatest in women who decreased their percentage of energy from fat the most. A similar, but lesser, trend was seen with increased vegetable and fruit intake.</p><p/><p>A low-fat diet can be implemented in two ways. First, the registered dietitian can provide the patient with specific menu plans that emphasize the use of reduced-fat foods. As one guideline, if a food &quot;melts&quot; in your mouth, it probably has fat in it. Second, individuals can be instructed in counting fat grams as an alternative to counting calories. Fat has 9.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/g</span>. It is thus very easy to calculate the number of grams of fat an individual can eat for any given level of energy intake.</p><p>Many experts recommend keeping calories from fat to below 30 percent of total calories. In practical terms, this means eating approximately 33 g of fat for each 1000 calories in the diet. For simplicity, we use 30 g of fat or less for each 1000 kcal. For a 1500-calorie diet, this would mean approximately 45 g or less of fat, which can be counted using the nutrition information labels on food packages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-carbohydrate diets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proponents of low-carbohydrate diets have argued that the increasing obesity epidemic may be, in part, due to low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets. But this may be dependent upon the type of carbohydrates that are eaten, such as energy-dense snacks and sugar- or high fructose-containing beverages. If a low-carbohydrate diet is chosen, healthy choices for fat (mono- and polyunsaturated fats) and protein (fish, nuts, legumes, and poultry) should be encouraged because of the association between saturated fat intake and risk of coronary heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H4190314114\" class=\"local\">'Choice of diet'</a> above.)</p><p>Low-carbohydrate (60 to 130 grams) and very low carbohydrate (0 to &lt;60 grams) diets are more effective for short-term weight loss than low-fat diets, although probably not for long-term weight loss. A meta-analysis of five trials found that the difference in weight loss at six months, favoring the low-carbohydrate over low-fat diet, was not sustained at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Restriction of carbohydrates leads to glycogen mobilization and, if carbohydrate intake is less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> ketosis will develop. Rapid weight loss occurs, primarily due to glycogen breakdown and fluid loss rather than fat loss. In addition, very-low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diets are associated with a small increase in energy expenditure that wanes over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>A low-carbohydrate diet can be implemented in two ways, either by reducing the total amount of carbohydrate or by consuming foods with a lower glycemic index or glycemic load (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56170\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56170 \">table 3</a>). However, the latter approach is of uncertain benefit. In a meta-analysis of trials comparing low and high glycemic index diets, there was no significant difference in weight loss, lipids, anthropometric measures, glycated hemoglobin (A1C), and fasting glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Glycemic index and load are reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-carbohydrates#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary carbohydrates&quot;, section on 'Glycemic index'</a>.)</p><p>Low-carbohydrate diets with healthy choices for fat and protein may have some other beneficial effects with regard to risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and some cancers, particularly if attention is paid to the type as well as the quantity of carbohydrate. During 26 years of follow-up of women in the Nurses' Health Study and 20 years of follow-up of men in the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study, low-carbohydrate diets in the highest versus lowest decile for vegetable proteins and fat were associated with lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.75-0.85) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.87) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. By contrast, low-carbohydrate diets in the highest versus lowest decile for animal protein and fat were associated with higher all-cause (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11-1.37) and cardiovascular (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.29) mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-fat\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary fat&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-primary-prevention-of-coronary-heart-disease-and-stroke#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of primary prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke&quot;, section on 'Healthy diet'</a>.)</p><p>Very low carbohydrate diets may be associated with more frequent side effects than low-fat diets. In one of the trials noted above, a number of symptoms occurred significantly more frequently in the low-carbohydrate compared with the low-fat diet group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. These included constipation (68 versus 35 percent), headache (60 versus 40 percent), halitosis (38 versus 8 percent), muscle cramps (35 versus 7 percent), diarrhea (23 versus 7 percent), general weakness (25 versus 8 percent), and rash (13 versus 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Despite the higher rate of symptoms, dropout rates in clinical trials have been similar for low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">High-protein diets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-protein diets have been recommended for the treatment of obesity because they are more satiating and stimulate thermogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In one meta-analysis of trials comparing the long-term effects of low-fat diets with either high or low protein content, there were no significant differences in weight loss, waist circumference, lipids, and blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In another meta-analysis of trials evaluating short-term effects (mean trial duration 12 weeks), there were modest reductions in weight, fat mass, and triglycerides with a high compared with standard protein diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. If dietary fat is held constant, energy from carbohydrate sources increases as energy from dietary protein decreases. Thus, patients randomly assigned to the low-fat, high-protein diet had lower carbohydrate intake than those assigned to the low-fat, low-protein diet (typically 40 versus 55 to 65 percent of daily caloric intake). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Low-carbohydrate diets'</a> above.)</p><p>Higher-protein diets may improve weight maintenance. (See <a href=\"#H2695956473\" class=\"local\">'Maintaining weight loss'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Very low calorie diets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diets with energy levels between 200 and 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> are called &quot;very low calorie diets,&quot; while those below 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> can be termed starvation diets. The basis for these diets was the notion that the lower the calorie intake, the more rapid the weight loss, because the energy withdrawn from body fat stores is a function of the energy deficit. Starvation is the ultimate very low calorie diet and results in the most rapid weight loss. Although once popular, starvation diets are not recommended for treatment of obesity.</p><p>Very low calorie diets have not been shown to be superior to conventional diets for long-term weight loss. In a meta-analysis of six trials comparing very low calorie diets with conventional low-calorie diets, short-term weight loss was greater with very low calorie diets (16.1 versus 9.7 percent of initial weight), but there was no difference in long-term weight loss (6.3 versus 5.0 percent at one to five years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>The side effects of very low calorie diets include hair loss, thinning of the skin, and coldness. These diets are contraindicated for lactating and pregnant women and in children who require protein for linear growth. As with all diets, there is increased cholesterol mobilization from peripheral fat stores, thus increasing the risk of gallstones.</p><p>Very low calorie diets should be reserved for individuals who require rapid weight loss for a specific purpose, such as surgery. The weight regain when the diet is stopped is often rapid, and it is better to take a more sustainable approach than to use a method that cannot be sustained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3964679270\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternate-day fasting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternate-day fasting has been proposed as a strategy to produce weight loss. In a systematic review of three randomized trials evaluating intermittent fasting, there was improvement in weight (loss of 6.5 percent of body weight in one 12-week trial) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In a subsequent trial, individuals were randomly assigned to alternate-day fasting (25 percent of energy needs on fast days; 125 percent of energy needs on alternating &quot;feast days&quot;), calorie restriction (75 percent of energy needs every day), or a no-intervention control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. At 6 and 12 months, mean weight loss compared with controls was similar for individuals in the alternate-day fasting group and in the daily calorie restriction group. For some people, alternate-day fasting may be easier than a very low calorie diet, but the weight loss is not different.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF DIETARY COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary counseling may produce modest, short-term weight losses. This topic is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Behavioral therapy&quot;, section on 'Elements of behavioral strategies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy#H386459340\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Behavioral therapy&quot;, section on 'Efficacy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H830335432\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise programs added to diets with moderate-to-severe caloric restriction have little additional effect upon weight loss. However, adding exercise to diet may have important benefits independent of weight loss. Physical activity attenuates the diet-induced loss of muscle mass, which increases physical functioning and insulin sensitivity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Role of physical activity and exercise&quot;, section on 'Treatment for obesity'</a>.)</p><p>Loss of lean mass is to be expected, in addition to fat loss, during weight loss. When weight increases as a result of overeating, approximately 75 percent of the extra energy is stored as fat and the remaining 25 percent as lean tissue. Thus, it should be anticipated that during weight loss, approximately 20 percent of weight loss will be lean mass (eg, muscle) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. A desirable feature of any calorie-restricted diet, however, is that it results in the lowest possible loss of lean mass in order to preserve resting metabolic rate. Nevertheless, &ge;20 percent of lost weight will be lean mass, particularly if exercise is excluded from the weight loss plan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2695956473\"><span class=\"h1\">MAINTAINING WEIGHT LOSS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adaptations favoring weight gain</strong> &ndash; Although many individuals have success losing weight with diet, most subsequently regain much or all of the lost weight, due to the following adaptations:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A reduction in energy expenditure induced by weight loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63172\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63172 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Changes in peripheral hormonal signals that regulate appetite. Ghrelin, which stimulates appetite, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which may promote energy storage, increase after diet-induced weight loss. Other circulating mediators that inhibit food intake (eg, leptin, peptide YY, cholecystokinin, amylin) decrease. These hormonal adaptations can persist for at least one year after diet-induced weight loss, collectively conspiring against weight loss maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Exercise and behavioral interventions are two important strategies to mitigate these factors.

Since long-term adherence to a weight-maintaining diet is probably the most important determinant of success, the optimal weight-maintaining diet will depend upon preference and individual factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is little consensus on the optimal mix of macronutrients to maintain weight loss. The satiating effects of high-protein, low glycemic index diets have generated interest in manipulating protein composition and glycemic index in weight-maintenance diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. As an example, in a multicenter trial of five ad libitum diets to prevent weight regain over 26 weeks, 773 adults who had successfully lost 8 percent of their body weight on a low-calorie diet (800 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day),</span> were randomly assigned in a two-by-two factorial design to a high- or low-protein (25 versus 13 percent of total calories), high or low glycemic index, or control diet (moderate protein content) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In the intention-to-treat analysis, weight regain during the trial was modest but significantly greater in the low- versus high-protein groups (mean difference 0.93 kg) and in the high versus low glycemic index groups (mean difference 0.95 kg). Only individuals in the high-protein, low glycemic index diet group continued to lose weight (mean change -0.38 kg). The trial was limited by the moderate dropout rate (29 percent) and short-term follow-up (six months). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'High-protein diets'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Low-carbohydrate diets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a small, four-week crossover trial in 21 obese and overweight young adults who had achieved a 10 to 15 percent weight loss, a low-fat diet resulted in decreases in resting and total energy expenditure compared with low glycemic index and very low carbohydrate diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

It is hypothesized that the antiaging effects of caloric restriction are due to reduced energy expenditure resulting in a reduction in production of reactive oxygen species (and therefore a reduction in oxidative damage). In addition, other metabolic effects associated with caloric restriction, such as improved insulin sensitivity, might also have an antiaging effect. In one trial of 48 sedentary, overweight men and women, six months of caloric restriction (with or without exercise) resulted in significant weight loss as expected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In addition, calorie restriction-mediated reductions in fasting insulin concentrations, core body temperature, serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and oxidative damage to DNA (as reflected by a reduction in DNA fragmentation) were seen, suggesting a possible antiaging effect of the prolonged caloric restriction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H417756831\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

We suggest choosing a dietary pattern of healthful foods, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or Mediterranean-style diet, rather than focusing on a specific nutrient (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Diets which emphasize reductions in refined carbohydrates, processed meats, and foods high in sodium and trans fat; moderation in unprocessed red meats, poultry, eggs, and milk; and high intakes of fruits, nuts, fish, vegetables, vegetable oils, minimally processed whole grains, legumes, and yogurt are preferred.
