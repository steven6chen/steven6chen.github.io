This point should be emphasized to the patient who is likely to have many fears and anxieties regarding the risks. Nonetheless, women with epilepsy are at increased risk for a range of perinatal complications compared with the general population, including preeclampsia, preterm labor, and fetal and maternal mortality. It is important for physicians and women with epilepsy to be aware of these as careful planning and management of pregnancy can increase the odds of a favorable outcome.</p><p>There are a number of important issues to be addressed by the physician when a woman with epilepsy becomes pregnant; these include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are antiseizure drugs necessary?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What effect do antiseizure drugs have on the fetus?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What effect does maternal epilepsy have on the fetus?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What effect does pregnancy have on seizures?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How should the patient be managed during pregnancy and delivery?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How should the patient be managed during the postpartum period?</p><p/><p>This topic will discuss the risks associated with epilepsy and pregnancy. The management of pregnancy and epilepsy is discussed separately.

The magnitude of the increase in risk appears to be relatively small for most complications (ie, between 1 and 1.5 times expected rates), with the exception of maternal mortality, which may be as much as 10-fold higher among women with epilepsy during the delivery hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Risk estimates derived from a population-based cohort study of delivery hospitalizations in 69,383 pregnant women with epilepsy and over 20 million pregnant women without epilepsy in US hospitals between 2007 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] are generally similar to those derived from a meta-analysis of previous smaller studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

There are a number of possibilities, including an increase in medical comorbidities among women with epilepsy, an increase in life-threatening complications of pregnancy, and an increase in seizure-related complications, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Previous, smaller studies have also raised concern that mortality rates may be higher in women with epilepsy compared with the general population of pregnant women and provided some insight into the contribution of SUDEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study that examined all epilepsy-related deaths in a United Kingdom population-based registry for maternal deaths during pregnancy found 14 deaths in women with epilepsy out of a total of over two million pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Eleven out of fourteen deaths (80 percent) were attributed to SUDEP in the period from 2006 to 2008. Using these numbers and an estimate of the expected rate of epilepsy in the overall population of pregnant women in the United Kingdom (0.6 percent), the authors estimated a death rate from epilepsy of 1 in 1,000 among women with epilepsy, which was tenfold higher than the estimated rate in the overall study population (11 per 100,000).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This rate is similar in magnitude to estimates of SUDEP risk in the chronic epilepsy population, and therefore the pregnancy-attributable risk of SUDEP among women with epilepsy is not certain. Two-thirds of the deaths were in women treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>; additional details of seizure control and other potential risk factors for SUDEP were not available from the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. SUDEP is discussed in more detail separately.

The mechanism of an increased risk of fetal death among women with epilepsy is also not well understood. Some studies have found that treated versus untreated epilepsy carried a higher risk of miscarriage or stillbirth; but treatment may have been a marker for more serious epilepsy rather than the cause of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a large European registry, only 1 of 165 reported miscarriages or stillbirths was associated with seizures or status epilepticus (SE); two-thirds of these pregnancies were seizure free [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Data on whether antiseizure drug exposure contributes to risk of spontaneous miscarriage are mixed, but in aggregate the contribution appears to be minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a large population-based observational study that included nearly one million pregnancies, women using antiseizure drugs during pregnancy had a slightly higher risk of spontaneous abortion compared with women not using antiseizure drugs (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.24); however, when limited to women with an epilepsy diagnosis, the use of antiseizure drugs was not associated with increased risk (aRR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87-1.09) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6473478\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF PREGNANCY ON SEIZURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of seizures does not increase during pregnancy in the majority of women with epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/2,6,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,17-19</a>]. A large European registry of epilepsy in pregnancy confirmed the statistics related to seizure control in pregnancy which had been previously reported in an aggregate of smaller studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among 1956 pregnancies in 1882 women with epilepsy, seizure frequency and antiseizure drug treatment remained unchanged in 62 to 64 percent; 58 percent were seizure free during pregnancy. Risk factors for seizures during pregnancy included localization-related (focal) epilepsy as compared with generalized epilepsy and antiseizure drug polytherapy. SE occurred in 1.8 percent, one-third of which were convulsive type. No risk factors for SE were identified. In a cohort of 1297 pregnancies in women with epilepsy, seizures during the month prior to pregnancy was the most important predictor of seizures during pregnancy; other independent predictors included partial (versus generalized) seizures and polytherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women with catamenial epilepsy may have improved seizure control during pregnancy, possibly attributable to the absence of cyclical hormone variations and increased progesterone levels. In a prospective study of 274 women with epilepsy, women with catamenial epilepsy (n=59) were more likely to be seizure-free than those with non-catamenial epilepsy (80 versus 22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Many women who experience increased seizure frequency are sleep deprived or noncompliant because of concerns about the effects of the medication on the developing fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Altered antiseizure drug pharmacokinetics may also contribute to change in seizure frequency during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of epilepsy and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Drug levels and dose adjustment'</a>.)</p><p>Seizures rarely occur at the time of delivery, in only 3.5 percent of the European cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In a population-based study that included 706 pregnancies in women with epilepsy and over 100,000 pregnancies in those without epilepsy, peripartum depression affected 27 percent of women with epilepsy compared with 23 percent of women with other chronic diseases and 19 percent of the entire non-epilepsy population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Rates of anxiety were similarly elevated in women with epilepsy compared with all others (22 versus 15 percent). Risk factors for depression or anxiety among women with epilepsy included high seizure frequency, history of physical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sexual abuse, adverse socioeconomic factors, previous loss of a child, antiseizure drug use, unplanned pregnancy, and prepregnancy depression or anxiety.</p><p>Detection of depression during pregnancy is important because both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments are available, and untreated illness may have consequences for both mother and child. Several studies have suggested that women with epilepsy may be undertreated compared with women without epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], emphasizing the importance of screening and appropriate treatment.

Many of these drugs appear to be implicated in dysmorphisms, such as hypoplasia of the nails and distal phalanges, hypertelorism, and the &quot;anticonvulsant face&quot; (broad or depressed nasal bridge, short nose with anteverted nostrils, long upper lip, maxillary hypoplasia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35</a>]. In a retrospective review of children born to mothers with epilepsy, 74 percent of children exposed to antiseizure drugs in utero were identified by a panel of expert dysmorphologists as having facial features that were either mildly, moderately, or obviously suggestive of fetal anticonvulsant syndrome; however, 61 percent of unexposed children also had these facial features, suggesting that these can be nonspecific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

However, this study did not directly assess the risk associated with maternal seizures during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk to the fetus of maternal seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few studies have been performed on the direct effects of maternal seizures on the fetus. Fetal hypoxia may occur as a result of decreased placental blood flow or postictal apnea; but no information is available on the number or length of seizures that may jeopardize the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">124,125</a>]. One report of fetal heart rate monitoring during a maternal generalized tonic-clonic seizure lasting 2.5 minutes revealed significant fetal heart rate deceleration lasting up to 30 minutes after the seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. While nonconvulsive seizures are believed to be less dangerous, another case report has documented significant fetal bradycardia during a one-minute, complex partial seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].</p><p>Additional risks of maternal seizures include injury to the fetus, abruption, or miscarriage due to maternal trauma sustained during a seizure.</p><p>One prospective study found no association between first trimester seizures and major fetal malformations, but the confidence intervals were wide (odds ratio 0.6, 95% CI 0.1-2.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Another cohort study reported that the occurrence of one or more major antepartum seizures in 63 epileptic women did not significantly increase the rate of antepartum complications, congenital anomalies, stillbirth, fetal growth restriction, or microcephaly compared with epileptic women without antepartum seizures; however, long-term outcome data were not provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Finally, in a population-based data set in Taiwan, epileptic seizures during pregnancy were marginally associated with small for gestational age infants compared with women with epilepsy who did not suffer seizures during pregnancy (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01-1.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>].</p><p>Even for SE, the risks to the fetus are unclear. In a large European registry of 1956 pregnancies in 1882 women with epilepsy, SE occurred in 1.8 percent, one-third of which were convulsive type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Only one case of SE was associated with stillbirth; the remaining cases were not clearly associated with fetal or maternal complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Inheritance of epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epilepsy affects approximately 0.5 to 1 percent of the general population; the risk of a seizure disorder is greater among the children of with a parent with epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/127-131\" class=\"abstract_t\">127-131</a>].</p><p>The best estimates of familial risk come from a population-based study that included 660 individuals with epilepsy and nearly 2500 first-degree relatives living in a single county in the northern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. The cumulative incidence of any form of epilepsy by age 40 years was 4.5 percent among individuals with a first-degree relative with epilepsy, which was threefold higher than the incidence in the general population. The risk was highest for relatives of individuals with generalized epilepsy (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 8.3) and lowest for relatives of those with focal epilepsy (SIR 2.6).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179867437\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The magnitude of the increase in risk appears to be relatively small for most complications (ie, between 1 and 1.5 times expected rates), with the exception of maternal mortality, which may be as much as 10-fold higher among women with epilepsy during the delivery hospitalization. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Perinatal morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most women will have no alteration of their seizure pattern during pregnancy, especially if noncompliance and sleep deprivation are minimized. Altered pharmacokinetics of antiseizure drugs during pregnancy may also contribute to increased seizure frequency in a small number of women (see <a href=\"#H6473478\" class=\"local\">'Effect of pregnancy on seizures'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both major and minor malformations are more common in fetuses exposed to antiseizure drugs in utero compared with offspring of untreated women with epilepsy and women without epilepsy. The overall risk of major malformations is 4 to 6 percent; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> is a major contributor to this risk. Polypharmacy and higher antiseizure drug dose increase the risk. The timing (early versus late in gestation) and dose of exposure are also likely to be important. Valproate should be avoided in pregnancy, if possible. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Fetal and neonatal effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is increasing evidence that antiseizure drug exposure in utero may be associated with impaired cognitive development. The evidence for this association is strongest with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>, which has been associated with impaired cognitive and motor development as well as an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Long-term effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures, particularly convulsive seizures, are believed to be harmful to the fetus. Fetal bradycardia has been documented during maternal seizures. However, studies documenting the risk that seizures pose to the fetus are lacking. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Risk to the fetus of maternal seizures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risks associated with pregnancy and epilepsy can be minimized by preconception planning and careful management during pregnancy.
