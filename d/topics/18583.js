It works by sealing up or removing a diseased vein, so that blood cannot flow through it anymore. The blood that would normally flow through that vein finds another route back to the heart.</p><p>Vein ablation is done only to people who have not gotten better with simpler treatments.</p><p>Vein ablation can be done a few different ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sclerotherapy</strong> &ndash; For this procedure, the doctor injects a chemical into the diseased vein that causes it to collapse on itself. The vein stays in place, but it no longer carries blood. Sclerotherapy can be done in a doctor's office with local anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiofrequency or laser ablation</strong> &ndash; For these procedures, the doctor inserts a special wire into the diseased vein. This wire heats up the vein and seals it from the inside (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87609 \">figure 1</a>). The vein stays in place, but it no longer carries blood. These procedures involve only a small hole or cut in the skin, and can be done with very little anesthesia. They can often be done in a doctor's office.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vein ligation or stripping</strong> &ndash; These procedures involve surgery to remove the diseased vein or veins. People who have these procedures must have anesthesia and be treated in a hospital or surgery center. Veins are removed through many small cuts.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15095324\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I choose which procedure to have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, not usually. Your doctor will recommend which procedure would work for the type of vein problem you have.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15095339\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I prepare for vein ablation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on which procedure you will have. Your doctor will give you detailed instructions about your specific procedure.</p><p>In general, people having sclerotherapy or radiofrequency or laser ablation just have to take a pill to calm them before the procedure. Some people have to stop taking certain medicines before the procedure, but that is not common. People having vein ligation or stripping have a more complicated preparation, because these procedures involve surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15095356\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after vein ablation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After having a vein ablation procedure, most people are asked to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walk around for a few minutes multiple times a day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sitting or standing for too long</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prop up their leg while sitting (for example on pillows)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid heavy lifting or exercise for 1 to 2 weeks after the procedure</p><p/><p>Depending on the type of ablation procedure you have, you might be asked to wear special bandages or stockings called &quot;compression bandages&quot; or &quot;compression stockings.&quot; These bandages or stockings will put steady pressure on your leg and can help prevent bruising.</p><p>Also depending on what type of procedure you have, you might have to go back to the doctor a few days after your procedure for a test called an ultrasound. This is to make sure you have not developed any blood clots in your leg. It is very important to get this test if your doctor tells you to.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15095373\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen after vein ablation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The problems that can happen are different for the different procedures. In general, the problems can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood clots in the legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding under the skin that forms a soft lump called a &quot;hematoma&quot;</p><p/><p>People who have vein ligation or stripping can also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve damage</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15095390\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse right away if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are wearing bandages or stockings and your leg or foot tingles or feels cool or if the toes on the treated side turn white or purple &ndash; These symptoms probably mean that your bandages or stockings are too tight. You can remove them, but call your doctor or nurse, too.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have intense pain or swelling that does not get better with the pain medicines your doctor prescribed &ndash; These symptoms could be a sign that you have a clot in your leg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You bleed through your bandages even after the doctor has adjusted them, or you bleed and soak your bandages.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15095407\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicose-veins-and-other-vein-disease-in-the-legs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Varicose veins and other vein disease in the legs (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=superficial-vein-phlebitis-and-thrombosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Superficial vein phlebitis and thrombosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doppler-ultrasound-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Doppler ultrasound (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-blood-clots-in-the-legs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the legs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Endovascular surgery (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-venous-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic venous disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
