By providing an appropriate heart rate and heart rate response, cardiac pacing can reestablish effective circulation and more normal hemodynamics that are compromised by a slow heart rate.</p><p>This topic will present a broad review of the role of cardiac pacing in a variety of settings. The management of the specific disorders is discussed separately as is a description of the different types of pacemakers and pacing modes.

These patients will often have evidence of persistent or intermittent sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities. </p><p>Establishing a direct correlation between symptoms and bradyarrhythmias, typically by taking a careful history and documenting the cardiac rhythm with either an electrocardiogram or ambulatory monitoring (external or implantable loop recorder), is essential for choosing the optimal candidates for pacemaker insertion. A direct correlation between symptoms and bradyarrhythmias will increase the likelihood of pacemaker therapy resulting in clinical improvement. Conversely, failure to document such a correlation, or the presence of an alternative explanation for symptoms, decreases the likelihood of benefit from pacemaker insertion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Location of conduction abnormality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The location of an AV conduction abnormality (ie, within the AV node or below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system) is an important determinant of both the probability and the likely pace of progression of conduction system disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63340\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63340 \">figure 1</a>).

While patients who have a reversible bradyarrhythmia may require temporary pacemaker support, in most circumstances permanent cardiac pacing is not indicated or required. Some of the more common reversible causes of bradyarrhythmia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications (eg, beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmic medications [eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>]) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-atrioventricular-block#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of atrioventricular block&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxic, metabolic, and electrolyte disturbances (eg, hyperkalemia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute myocardial ischemia or infarction (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Post myocardial infarction'</a> below) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac trauma (eg, post-operative, blunt chest trauma, indwelling pulmonary artery catheters) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lyme disease </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute bacterial endocarditis with an aortic valve abscess damaging the His-Purkinje system</p><p/><p>Reversible causes of bradyarrhythmias and the management of reversible causes with temporary cardiac pacing are discussed in detail separately.

ICDs (with the exception of the subcutaneous ICD) have antitachycardia and antibradycardia pacing therapeutic capabilities. In patients who have a permanent pacemaker and require an ICD or CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy), the pacemaker should be upgraded to the appropriate device so that all functions can be served by one pulse generator. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillators&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403204731\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF PERMANENT PACEMAKER SYSTEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All cardiac pacemakers consistent of two components: a pulse generator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104720\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104720 \">picture 1</a>), which provides the electrical impulse for myocardial stimulation; and one or more electrodes (commonly referred to as leads), which deliver the electrical impulse from the pulse generator to the myocardium. The original cardiac pacing systems consisted of pulse generators in the abdomen with epicardial lead placed surgically. Over time, pacemaker systems evolved to predominantly placing the pulse generator in a pre-pectoral position with transvenously-placed endocardial leads, which were easier to insert and required less extensive surgery. While transvenous leads may have superior long-term function when compared with epicardial leads, there are other potential long-term complications (eg, venous thrombosis, infection, lead malfunction, etc). Leadless cardiac pacing systems, currently in development and in clinical trials, offer the promise of long-term pacing capability without lead-associated complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403204765\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulse generators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulse generators are the &quot;battery&quot; component of the pacemaker (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104720\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104720 \">picture 1</a>), generating the electrical impulse which is transmitted to the myocardium, resulting in the heart beat. While the initial pulse generators were located in the abdomen, pulse generators are currently implanted most commonly in the infraclavicular region of the anterior chest wall. The majority are placed in a pre-pectoral position, but in some cases a sub-pectoral position is advantageous. For most patients with the pulse generator in this location, the impulses generated are transmitted to the myocardium via transvenous leads. Epicardial systems are still available and may be necessary as a result of anatomical limitations to placing a transvenous lead(s). For the leadless systems that are in development, the pulse generator and the electrode are one self-contained unit, which is positioned via the femoral vein. (See <a href=\"#H403204752\" class=\"local\">'Leadless systems'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403204738\"><span class=\"h2\">Transvenous systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of contemporary cardiac pacing systems utilize transvenous electrodes (leads) for transmission of the pacing impulses from the pulse generator to the myocardium. Transvenous leads are usually placed percutaneously or with a cephalic cutdown, without the need for intrathoracic surgery and inherent associated morbidities. Transvenous leads, however, are associated with a non-trivial rate of long-term complications, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venous thrombosis and resultant subclavian vein occlusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lead malfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricuspid valve injury (resulting in tricuspid regurgitation) </p><p/><p>The approach to the management of long-term transvenous lead complications is discussed separately.

These systems have largely been replaced by transvenous systems for patients requiring long-term cardiac pacing, although there is still a role for the occasional patient with vascular access problems (eg, venous thrombosis, congenital anatomical variations, prosthetic tricuspid valve). The major role for epicardial pacing systems in current practice is for temporary pacing following cardiac surgery; such systems, however, are designed as temporary systems that must be removed within the first days to weeks following cardiac surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403204752\"><span class=\"h2\">Leadless systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In response to the limitations of both transvenous and epicardial pacing systems, efforts have been made to develop leadless cardiac pacing systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>]. Initial leadless systems involved multiple components but were associated with high complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Subsequent leadless systems have utilized a self-contained system which includes both the pulse generator and the electrode within a single unit that is placed into the right ventricle via a transvenous approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the LEADLESS trial, which enrolled 33 patients with an indication for single-chamber right ventricular (RV) pacing, the leadless device was successfully implanted via transfemoral venous approach in 32 of 33 patients (97 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The primary endpoint, freedom from complications at 90 days, was achieved in 31 of 33 patients (94 percent).

Among the 300 patients followed for six months (of whom 11 had unsuccessful efforts at device implantation), 93 percent (270 out of 289) met the primary efficacy endpoint of acceptable pacing capture threshold (&lt;2 V at 0.4 milliseconds) and sensing amplitude (R wave &ge;5 mV or a value equal or greater than at implantation), while the primary safety endpoint (freedom from device-related adverse events) was also achieved in 93 percent of patients (280 out of 300). The most common device-related complications were device dislodgement (1.7 percent), cardiac perforation (1.3 percent), and elevated pacing thresholds requiring device repositioning (1.3 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Micra Transcatheter Pacing Study, which enrolled 725 patients with an indication for single-chamber RV pacing, the leadless device was successfully placed in 719 patients (99.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of freedom from device-related adverse events at six months (one of the two primary endpoints) was 96 percent. The second primary endpoint, &lt;2 V mean pacing capture threshold at 0.24 millisecond pulse width, was assessed at six months in a subset of 297 patients, among whom 292 (98.3 percent) reached the primary endpoint. Of the approximately 12 percent of patients with elevated pacing thresholds at the time of device implantation (high &gt;1.0 V and very high &gt;1.5 V), over 85 percent had returned to normal pacing thresholds (&le;1.0 V) by six months post-implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. At intermediate-term follow-up (12 months for safety outcomes), 96 percent of patients remained free of major device-related complications, with a significantly lower risk of major complications compared with historical control patients who received transvenous pacemakers (hazard ratio 0.52; 95% CI 0.35-0.77) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the SELECT-LV study, a prospective, non-randomized study of safety and efficacy of leadless pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) among patients who &quot;failed&quot; conventional CRT, the leadless device was successfully implanted in 34 of 35 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The primary efficacy endpoint (biventricular pacing on ECG at one month) was achieved in 33 of 34 patients; however, significant procedure and device-related complication occurred in three patients (9 percent) at the time of implant and in eight patients (23 percent) within the first month post-implant.</p><p/><p>Leadless cardiac pacing systems have been approved for use in Europe since 2013, and in April 2016, the first leadless cardiac pacing system was approved for use in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients frequently present for consideration of pacemaker placement because of symptoms that may be due to bradyarrhythmias (eg, dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, fatigue, and poor exercise tolerance). It is critical to attempt to establish a direct correlation between symptoms and bradyarrhythmias, which will increase the likelihood of recommending pacemaker placement. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The location of an atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormality (ie, within the AV node or below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system) is an important determinant of both the probability and the likely pace of progression of conduction system disease. Disease below the AV node, in the His-Purkinje system, is generally considered to be less stable; as a result, permanent pacemaker placement is more likely to be recommended. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Location of conduction abnormality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pacemakers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104720\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104720 \">picture 1</a>) are most commonly placed in a thoracic pre-pectoral position and connected to one or two transvenous leads, which are positioned endocardially. Epicardial lead placement is still a viable option for patients with limited transvenous access. Leadless pacing systems are now available and hold significant promise for the future. (See <a href=\"#H403204731\" class=\"local\">'Types of permanent pacemaker systems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common indications for pacemaker implantation are sinus node dysfunction followed by AV block. All other indications are much less common and include neurocardiogenic syncope and iatrogenic causes (eg, post-AV node ablation). While patients with a heart rate of less than 40 beats per minute, or pauses of greater than four seconds, are more likely to develop symptoms, there is no definitive threshold for heart rate (or pause length) which determines the absolute need for a permanent pacemaker. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Common indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the advent of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), it is important to also take into consideration the patient's left ventricular function at the time a pacemaker is considered. If the patient has left ventricular dysfunction and requires frequent pacing, it may be appropriate to consider CRT or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for patients with heart failure symptoms and reduced ejection fraction.
