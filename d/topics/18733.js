Because vitamins (with the exception of vitamin D) cannot be synthesized by humans, they need to be ingested in the diet to prevent disorders of metabolism. They should be distinguished from minerals (such as calcium and iron), some of which are also essential micronutrients.</p><p>When vitamin deficiency is defined as low blood levels, or levels associated with reversible metabolic changes, the prevalence of vitamin deficiency on typical Western diets is higher than generally believed, especially in older adults. Pregnancy and alcohol consumption may increase requirements for some vitamins. Subtle deficiencies in several vitamins, at levels below those causing classic vitamin deficiency syndromes (eg, scurvy or pellagra), have been associated with chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and osteoporosis in observational studies. However, it is less well-established that the vitamins in supplements can prevent or reverse chronic diseases.</p><p>Studies of the effects of vitamins have tended to disagree with each other. This is partly because subsequent randomized trials have contradicted prior, more fallible, observational studies. Additionally, studies of vitamin effects have often not taken into account baseline vitamin status and dose, both of which are critical determinants of biologic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Genetic factors may affect how vitamins are metabolized and the consequences of supplementation in various clinical situations and doses. Not enough is yet known to use genetic information to guide clinical decisions about vitamin dose and deficiencies, but that information is likely to become available.</p><p>The evidence for using vitamin supplementation to prevent chronic disease is reviewed here. The potential benefits of vitamin supplementation in specific disease conditions are discussed on topics about those conditions. Overviews of individual vitamins, dietary minerals, and dietary supplements are also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-water-soluble-vitamins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of water-soluble vitamins&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-a\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin A&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-d\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin D&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-e\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin E&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dietary trace minerals&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of herbal medicine and dietary supplements&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VITAMIN DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concept of vitamin deficiency has evolved since vitamins were first discovered, from obvious vitamin deficiency syndromes to the subtle effects of suboptimal vitamin intake on chronic diseases.</p><p>Gross vitamin deficiency may be recognized by obvious clinical syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79983\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79983 \">table 1</a>). These syndromes are still seen in areas of the world with very poor diets. In Western societies, they occur mainly in special populations, including older adults; vegans; new immigrants; the very poor; patients with alcoholism, malabsorption, little sun exposure, history of gastric bypass surgery, or inborn errors of metabolism; and those undergoing hemodialysis or receiving parenteral nutrition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81037\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81037 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Dietary reference intakes (DRIs) represent four concepts: the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA); Adequate Intake (AI); Estimated Average Requirement (EAR); and Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL). DRIs are established in the United States by the National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council, and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F106207\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106207 \">table 3</a>). For clinical purposes, we still refer to the RDA, which is the average daily intake that is sufficient to meet the dietary requirement of nearly all healthy people. The AI is used when the RDA cannot be determined (as is still the case for vitamin supplementation in infants &lt;12 months and for vitamin K) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F106207\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106207 \">table 3</a>). However, these intake levels may not be adequate for preventing chronic disease in some people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74132943\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of serum levels of several vitamins is widely available. Fueled by popular belief in the importance of vitamins and by commercial interests, testing is being promoted to screen for unrecognized deficiency and to tailor supplements to individual needs. This practice seems unwarranted in most patients for two main reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is insufficient information about the optimum blood levels of vitamins, making it difficult to interpret subtle deficiency states.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a lack of evidence that vitamin supplements prevent disease in many healthy adults with low blood levels of vitamins, apart from those with specific diets or medical conditions.</p><p/><p>Testing for specific deficiencies remains appropriate in clinical situations where deficiencies are suspected (eg, measuring levels of vitamin D in older adult patients with osteoporosis or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> in patients with cognitive decline of unknown etiology).</p><p>Test results are useful if clearly high or low to diagnose or rule out gross deficiency. However, the meaning of a &quot;normal&quot; value is uncertain; it is defined as the range of usual values in the general population, but many of these people may have suboptimal intake (just as, for example, commonly occurring levels of cholesterol or blood pressure may be harmful).</p><p>Inadequate intake or low serum levels of some vitamins can be associated with biochemical abnormalities. As examples, the serum concentration of homocysteine rises with diets low in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>, methylmalonic acid rises with low intake of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a>, and parathyroid hormone rises with low intake of vitamin D. These biochemical abnormalities generally improve with increasing intake and reach a plateau beyond which more intake causes no further improvement, suggesting a correctable metabolic disorder.</p><p>Additional information about genetic polymorphisms, which increase requirements for specific vitamins, is likely to become available. This appears to be the case for certain genes, such as those controlling the metabolism of folate and vitamin D. However, there is not enough understanding of individual risk to warrant routine testing for vitamin levels or testing for polymorphisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoporosis#H14954217\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>The remainder of this topic review will address the effectiveness of individual vitamin supplements in preventing specific diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLIC ACID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Folate is the natural form of the vitamin found in food and is present in green, leafy vegetables, fruits, cereals, grains, nuts, and meats. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Folic acid</a> is the synthetic form of the vitamin that is included in supplements and food fortification, and has many of the same biologic effects as folate, but is more bioavailable and therefore more effective dose for dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some evidence suggests that the metabolism of folic acid differs from folate and may have toxicities under certain circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Gross deficiency of folate leads to megaloblastic anemia.

Overall, the only well-established benefit of folic acid supplementation is the prevention of neural tube defects.

This is discussed in detail elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a 2013 meta-analysis of randomized trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> in patients with colorectal adenoma (3 trials; n = 2652) or for prevention of cardiovascular disease (10 trials; n = 46,969), during an average of 5.2 years of treatment, there was no significant difference in overall cancer incidence for patients assigned to folic acid or placebo (7.7 versus 7.3 percent; relative risk [RR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.99-1.13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There was also no statistical difference in the incidence of specific cancers, including cancers of the large intestine, prostate, lung, or breast. The doses of folic acid in the included trials ranged from 0.5 to 5 mg daily, which is greater than the amount of folic acid in fortified cereal products and flour. One limitation of the included trials is that the average duration of intervention (five years) is short and may not be sufficient to characterize long-term benefits or harm of folic acid supplementation. In addition, the trials do not address underlying nutrition status and other preventive measures. Since the evidence is inconclusive, we recommend not taking folic acid supplementation for the sole purpose of reducing cancer risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64967839\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High levels of homocysteine are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

Dietary vitamin D intake is often low in older adults. Thus, for most older adults, we suggest supplementation with 1000 units of vitamin D daily; there can be downward adjustment in this dose for dietary intake. Other experts, including other authors for UpToDate suggest somewhat lower daily doses of vitamin D supplements.

However, many people take multivitamins, and common formulations, generally containing 0.5 to 1.5 times the daily reference intakes of individual vitamins, are likely safe in nearly all people. Because some vitamins in larger doses can be harmful in some people, high-dose vitamin recommendations should be tailored to individual patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A balanced diet with fruits and vegetables promotes health not only by providing known vitamins, but also because it contains fiber and other less well-defined nutrients and replaces meat and animal fat. People on restricted or special diets, or those living in regions of the world with widespread malnutrition, may have additional needs for vitamin supplementation. (See <a href=\"#H54\" class=\"local\">'Special diets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adults with a balanced diet, there is no convincing evidence that taking multivitamins in the usual doses of 50 to 200 percent of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is either helpful or harmful. If the multivitamin includes vitamins E <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> A, these should be in low doses (eg, no more than 30 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>; no more than 2500 international units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinicians should strongly recommend vitamin supplements in the doses and clinical situations in which they are known to be beneficial (see below) and against vitamin supplements in doses or clinical situations in which they are harmful (see below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For people on balanced, developed-world diets (ie, those eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, and proteins), we suggest <strong>not</strong> taking multivitamin supplements (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Clinicians can tell patients that such supplements are unnecessary but should understand that many patients want to take vitamins based on their own belief systems and not struggle against that practice as long as it is harmless. (See <a href=\"#H48\" class=\"local\">'Multivitamins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are at increased risk of vitamin deficiency in some clinical situations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81037\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81037 \">table 2</a>). Classical vitamin deficiency syndromes such as scurvy, beriberi, and pellagra do exist in special clinical populations and more generally in resource-poor regions of the world. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for vitamin blood levels is not indicated in healthy adults and should be undertaken only if there is clinical suspicion of vitamin deficiency, such as measurement of B12 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> methylmalonic acid levels in patients with macrocytic anemia and vitamin D levels in the evaluation of established osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"#H74132943\" class=\"local\">'Testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin supplementation is known to be effective in some specific clinical situations:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In women who could become pregnant, we recommend supplementation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).

We administer 1000 units of vitamin D daily, depending on dietary intake. Other experts, including other authors for UpToDate, use somewhat lower daily doses of vitamin D.

Specifically, the possibility raised by observational studies that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a> supplementation might prevent cardiovascular disease by lowering homocysteine has not been consistently supported by results of randomized trials. Similarly, the hypothesis that antioxidants prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer has also not been borne out by results of randomized trials. Also, in adults in developed countries, vitamin D supplementation appears to have little or no effect on bone mineral density in the short term. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Antioxidant vitamins'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Osteoporosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-homocysteine#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of homocysteine&quot;, section on 'Supplementation in the general population'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic factors may affect how vitamins are metabolized and the consequences of supplementation in various clinical situations and doses. Not enough is yet known to use genetic information to guide clinical decisions about vitamin dose and deficiencies, but that information is likely to become available.
