SBS in adults usually results from surgical resection for Crohn disease, malignancy, trauma, radiation, or vascular insufficiency. SBS is the most common cause of intestinal failure. This topic reviews the management of patients with SBS. The pathogenesis of SBS and associated chronic complications of SBS are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of the short bowel syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3259999704\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Short bowel syndrome</strong> &ndash; Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a condition that results from surgical resection or congenital disease of the small intestine which is characterized by the inability to maintain protein-energy, fluid, electrolyte, or micronutrient balances when on a conventionally accepted, normal diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is a functional definition implying a significant amount of malabsorption of macronutrients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> micronutrients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The physiologic course of SBS is divided into the following phases: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Acute phase</strong> &ndash; The acute phase is characterized by high intestinal fluid losses and the metabolic derangement. It starts immediately after resection and generally lasts for three to four weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Adaptation phase</strong> &ndash; The adaptation phase is characterized by structural and functional changes to the remaining small bowel and colon in order to increase nutrient absorption and slow the gastrointestinal transit. The adaptive phase usually lasts for one to two years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H2321993451\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Intestinal adaptation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intestinal failure</strong> &ndash; Intestinal failure is defined as a reduction in gastrointestinal function below the minimum necessary for the absorption of macronutrients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> water and electrolytes such that intravenous supplementation is required to maintain <span class=\"nowrap\">health/growth</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Intestinal failure may result from SBS, intestinal fistula, intestinal dysmotility, mechanical obstruction, or extensive small bowel mucosal disease. Intestinal failure may be transient or permanent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intestinal rehabilitation</strong> &ndash; Intestinal rehabilitation refers to a multidisciplinary process aimed at improving intestinal function with the hope of liberating patients from parenteral nutrition and avoiding intestinal transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Comprehensive centers of excellence in intestinal failure use nutrition, pharmacologic, and in some cases, non-transplant surgical approaches to achieve this objective. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE PHASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the initial three to four weeks after lengthy intestinal resection, the predominant goals of management are to stabilize large fluid and electrolyte losses, and maintain fluid and <span class=\"nowrap\">acid/base</span> balance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1840735499\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous fluids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large-volume gastric or proximal small bowel fluid losses are relatively common in the early phase. As a result, intravenous fluid replacement with normal saline (0.9 percent) and supplemental potassium and magnesium are important. Stomal and fecal losses should be measured and replaced every one to two hours with a solution separate from the nutrition solution. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults#H2501608345\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postoperative fluid therapy in adults&quot;, section on 'Fluid resuscitation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2640212773\"><span class=\"h2\">Acid suppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A histamine 2-receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor should be administered intravenously initially to suppress gastric hypersecretion and reduce fluid losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Patients with SBS often develop gastric acid hypersecretion during the first six months following resection. This may be associated not only with acid-peptic disease and increased intestinal fluid losses, but also with deactivation of pancreatic enzymes and a reduction in the optimal pH needed for fat absorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H3312890356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Influence of SBS on gastric and pancreatic function'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3054564773\"><span class=\"h2\">Parenteral nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral nutrition should be introduced once the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid requirements are fairly constant. The need for long-term parenteral nutrition depends on the length of the small bowel resected, the site of resection, and the presence of colon in continuity with the small bowel. These determinants of intestinal function are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H1640994677\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Initial determinants of intestinal function'</a>.)</p><p>The formulation of parenteral nutrition, assessment of nutritional requirements, monitoring, and complications of parenteral nutrition are also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-parenteral-nutrition#H3863139972\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative parenteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Timing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3694322879\"><span class=\"h2\">Enteral feeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteral feeding, initially via a nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding tube, should be attempted as soon as possible after the SBS patient&rsquo;s condition has stabilized after surgery. Even patients in whom there is little potential for ultimate transition to exclusive enteral feeding may be able to achieve some degree of enteral tolerance and reduction in parenteral nutrition support if continuous enteral feeding is used to maximize adaptation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support#H8899572\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of perioperative nutritional support&quot;, section on 'Early enteral feeding'</a>.)</p><p>Continuous enteral feeding into the stomach permits constant saturation of carrier transport proteins and facilitates intestinal adaptation, thereby accelerating the progression to oral feeding, and is better tolerated than bolus feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Continuous tube feeding (exclusively or in conjunction with oral feeding) in the postoperative period has been shown to significantly increase net absorption of lipids, proteins, and energy compared with oral feeding alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Overnight feeding allows maximal use of the gut while enabling normal activities during the day. Use of a standard polymeric isotonic enteral formula is generally well tolerated. Elemental formulas should generally be avoided because of their hypertonicity, expense, and lack of evidence supporting benefit over standard formulas. A fiber-containing formula may be advantageous in the SBS patients with an intact colon. Although this has not been demonstrated to significantly increase macronutrient or energy absorption, it may increase <span class=\"nowrap\">stool/ostomy</span> effluent viscosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT IN ADAPTATION PHASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Structural and functional changes to increase nutrient absorption and slow the gastrointestinal transit occur in the adaptation phase. (See <a href=\"#H3259999704\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be transitioned to oral feedings in a slow and stepwise manner over a period of weeks to months. For those short bowel syndrome (SBS) patients with a colon-in-continuity, a diet high in complex carbohydrates and modest in fat and oxalate is recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F115221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115221 \">table 1</a>). No change in dietary protein is generally necessary because nitrogen absorption is least affected by the decreased absorptive surface in SBS patients. The use of peptide-based diets in patients with SBS is unnecessary. Other than avoidance of hypertonic fluids and carbohydrates (ie, antidumping diet), end-jejunostomy SBS patients do not require dietary modifications. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carbohydrate </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Complex carbohydrates are preferred and simple sugars should generally be avoided. In the absence of significant jejunal resection, lactose should not be restricted unless the patient is clearly lactose intolerant, given it is an important source of calcium and calories. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oxalate</strong> &ndash; In patients with SBS who have a colon-in-continuity, dietary oxalate should be restricted to reduce the risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, particularly in those with a history of nephrolithiasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of the short bowel syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Nephrolithiasis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fiber</strong> &ndash; Soluble fiber supplementation may be helpful by enhancing adaptation via increased short-chain fatty acid production and providing an additional calorie source in patients with an intact colon-in-continuity. In addition, fiber supplementation may slow gastric emptying and decrease the watery nature of the stools by adsorbing stool water. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fat</strong> &ndash; We advise moderate restriction in fat consumption in SBS patients with a colon-in-continuity, particularly those with steatorrhea and oxalate nephropathy. A diet high in complex carbohydrates (60 percent) and low in fat (20 percent) has been shown in SBS patients with a colon-in-continuity to reduce fecal calorie loss, increase overall energy absorption, and improve wet weight absorption; a reduction in magnesium and calcium loss and a reduction in oxalate absorption has also been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In contrast, the same diet in SBS patients without a colon resulted in no improvement in energy or wet weight absorption.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111555116\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SBS are at risk for dehydration. Oral intake should be adequate to compensate for all losses and to maintain a urine output of at least 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span>. Measures to decrease intestinal fluid loss include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>hypertonic</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>hypotonic</strong> <strong>fluids</strong> &ndash; Hypertonic fluids (eg, regular soda and fruit juices) should be avoided. Hypertonic fluids are concentrated and induce secretion from enterocytes in an attempt to dilute the concentration of the luminal contents, which then contributes to increased diarrhea. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hypotonic fluids (eg, water, tea, coffee, alcohol) do not contain the sodium or glucose necessary to optimally facilitate absorption in an end-jejunostomy patient and may lead to dehydration if consumed in large amounts. Patients with a residual colon, however, can usually maintain adequate hydration without excessive fluid loss with hypotonic fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glucose</strong>-<strong>electrolyte</strong> <strong>oral</strong> <strong>rehydration</strong> <strong>solution</strong> &ndash; SBS patients with an end-jejunostomy should be advised to drink one to three liters of oral rehydration solution daily, sipped throughout the day, to maintain adequate hydration. SBS patients with a residual colon may also benefit from use of an oral rehydration solution, particularly those with difficult to control diarrhea and recurrent dehydration. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal sodium concentration of oral rehydration solution to promote jejunal absorption has been demonstrated to be 90 to 120 mEq <span class=\"nowrap\">Na+/L</span>. NaCl should be added to commercially prepared oral rehydration solution with lower sodium. While fluid composition is less important in those with a colon, adequate dietary sodium should be provided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-therapy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral rehydration therapy&quot;, section on 'Commercial and standard ORS'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2670286206\"><span class=\"h2\">Precautions for orally administered medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SBS may be at risk for impaired absorption of oral medications. Most drugs are absorbed in the stomach and proximal small bowel, and thus their effect is preserved. Enteric-coated drugs and <span class=\"nowrap\">timed/delayed-release</span> medications, in contrast, may not be absorbed properly and should generally be avoided. When feasible, alternative methods for medication delivery (eg, liquid, transdermal, suppositories) should be used and medication levels should be monitored.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111555138\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic therapy to reduce fluid loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of pharmacologic agents have been used to reduce secretory losses and decrease intestinal <span class=\"nowrap\">motility/transit</span> in patients with SBS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1544549515\"><span class=\"h3\">Acid suppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We administer proton pump inhibitors orally twice daily for hypergastrinemia in the first six months after enterectomy in patients with SBS. As gastric acid has a role in suppressing overgrowth of upper gut bacteria, acid-suppressing agents should be used sparingly thereafter, particularly when there is documented small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-etiology-and-pathogenesis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Etiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Protective mechanisms against bacterial overgrowth'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2508621906\"><span class=\"h3\">Antidiarrheals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We treat all patients with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> or diphenoxylate as first-line agents to reduce intestinal motility and prolong transit time. These agents also have a small impact on reducing intestinal secretion. While antimotility agents may be effective in reducing intestinal transit, in cases where bowel dilatation has occurred, antimotility agents can rarely worsen diarrhea by allowing bacterial proliferation. Therefore, their use should be monitored closely with dose escalation or discontinuation according to the response.</p><p>These medications are generally administered about 30 minutes before meals and again at bedtime. As <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> enters the enterohepatic circulation, which is disrupted in SBS patients without an ileum, high doses are frequently needed (ie, up to 16 tablets per day). When ineffective, especially in SBS patients without a colon-in-continuity or those who are left with a minimum of residual jejunum or duodenum, we add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a> sulfate (15 to 60 mg two to three times a day) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tincture-of-opium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tincture of opium</a>. Loperamide and codeine may have a synergistic effect when used together [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The use of codeine and tincture of opium tends to be limited by their sedating effect. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3771412338\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional management for patients with high fluid losses</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1565979886\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotics for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The combination of bowel dilatation and altered transit frequently seen in SBS is thought to facilitate the development of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Because of limitations in the tests used to diagnose SIBO (ie, small bowel <span class=\"nowrap\">aspirate/colony</span> count, hydrogen breath test) in SBS, securing the diagnosis of SIBO is challenging. As such, in the presence of typical symptoms (eg, gas-bloat, diarrhea, discomfort), empiric antimicrobial treatment is often provided. A variety of oral broad-spectrum antibiotics can be used with success being judged on improvement in symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral intake, reduction in stool output, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weight gain. The continuous use of low-dose, rotating cycle of antibiotics in SBS may be necessary in some patients. Antibiotic treatment regimens for SIBO are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-management#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Management&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H227046248\"><span class=\"h3\">Octreotide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> should be reserved for patients with intravenous fluid requirements that are greater than 3 L per day and only after the period of maximal intestinal adaptation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Typical candidates include SBS patients with a high-output end-jejunostomy. Octreotide increases small bowel transit time and reduces fluid losses, but tachyphylaxis often develops. In patients with no significant reduction in stool output within four to six weeks despite titrating the dose, octreotide should be discontinued. Octreotide diminishes splanchnic protein synthesis, which can interfere with the process of adaptation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. In addition, octreotide is expensive, requires a painful subcutaneous injection, and predisposes patients to the development of gallstones for which patients with SBS are at high risk.

The choice is determined by concerns regarding the patient&rsquo;s blood pressure and the patient&rsquo;s willingness to administer a subcutaneous injection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clonidine</a> &ndash; Clonidine, which can be administered both orally and transdermally, has also shown modest benefit in treating high output stool losses presumably via its effects on intestinal motility and secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Its clinical benefit, however, has yet to be clearly demonstrated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>GLP-1 analogues</strong> &ndash; In a retrospective open-label study, a long-acting GLP-1 analogue was associated with a reduction in parenteral nutrition requirements in five adult short bowel syndrome patients, presumably through slowing gut transit given its lack of intestinotrophic properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A subsequent placebo-controlled study evaluating the acute effects of continuous infusions of GLP-1, GLP-2, and a combination of both GLP-1 and GLP-2 in adults with short bowel syndrome found that all treatments significantly reduced the fecal wet weight, energy, nitrogen, sodium, and potassium losses compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

An optimal interval for making weaning decisions has not been defined. Gradual parenteral nutrition reductions can be made by decreasing the days that parenteral nutrition is infused per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, decreasing the daily parenteral nutrition infusion volume equally throughout the week (eg, 10 to 30 percent reduction daily) is associated with a lower risk of dehydration. Parenteral nutrition reductions are based on tolerance as determined by the development of symptoms, hydration status, electrolytes, and weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Additional studies are needed to determine whether the intestinal adaptation due to teduglutide is sustained after discontinuation of therapy and if long-term use is associated with a reduction in complications associated with parenteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the pivotal (second) phase 3 randomized controlled trial, 86 patients with short bowel syndrome with intestinal failure were randomized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teduglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teduglutide</a> (0.05 mg per kg per day) or placebo for 24 weeks. A significantly higher proportion of patients treated with teduglutide had a 20 percent reduction in the volume of parenteral support as compared with placebo (63 versus 30 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The mean reduction in parenteral support volume after 24 weeks was 4.4 L in the teduglutide group compared with 2.3 L in the placebo group. Fifty-four percent of those receiving teduglutide reduced at least one parenteral support day per week compared with 23 percent for placebo. In a two-year extension study, 65 patients (74 percent) completed the study. Of the 30 patients treated for 30 months with teduglutide, 28 (93 percent) made additional reductions in parenteral support with a mean decrease of 7.6 L per week, and 21 (70 percent) eliminated at least one infusion day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

We do not generally recommend its use in our SBS patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> &ndash; Early open-label reports have suggested that the combination of glutamine, growth hormone, glutamine, and a diet optimized to the short bowel patient&rsquo;s residual bowel anatomy enhanced the adaptation process and allowed enteral nutrition in patients who had been dependent upon parenteral nutrition (PN) and allowed successful, long-term weaning of PN. A subsequent prospective, randomized, controlled study of recombinant human GH (0.10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/d)</span> and an optimized diet with or without glutamine in 41 PN-dependent SBS patients (most with colon-in-continuity) found a significant reduction in PN requirements (the primary endpoint) in all groups studied at the end of the four-week inpatient treatment period. The extent of reduction was greatest in the group receiving GH in addition to the diet and glutamine.

However, the probability of eliminating parenteral nutrition use is &lt;6 percent, if not successfully accomplished in the first two years following the individual's last bowel resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a condition that results from surgical resection or congenital disease of the small intestine which is characterized by the inability to maintain protein-energy, fluid, electrolyte, or micronutrient balances when on a conventionally accepted, normal diet. The physiologic course of SBS is divided into two phases:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Acute phase</strong> &ndash; The acute phase is characterized by high intestinal losses and the metabolic derangement. It starts immediately after resection and generally lasts for three to four weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Adaptation phase</strong> &ndash; The adaptation phase is characterized by structural and functional changes to increase nutrient absorption and slow the gastrointestinal transit. The adaptive phase usually lasts for one to two years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of SBS in the acute phase primarily involves close monitoring of stool and urine output, and parenteral replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses. Parenteral nutrition should begin promptly once the patient stabilizes after intestinal resection. Enteral nutrition should also be attempted after the stool losses become controllable. The duration of parenteral nutrition support depends on the length of the small bowel resected, the site of resection, and the presence of an intact ileocecal valve and colon-in-continuity with the small bowel. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H1640994677\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Initial determinants of intestinal function'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend administering acid-suppressing medications (ie, H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors) to patients with SBS during the first three to six months after intestinal resection in order to reduce gastric secretion and enteral fluid losses (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Measures to reduce intestinal motility and secretions include the use of antidiarrheals (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a> sulfate). Restoration of intestinal continuity, such as re-anastomosis of small intestine with colon, should be performed whenever possible. We reserve the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> in SBS patients who continue to have high fluid losses (eg, end-jejunostomy patients). (See <a href=\"#H111555138\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy to reduce fluid loss'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3771412338\" class=\"local\">'Additional management for patients with high fluid losses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SBS may be at risk for impaired absorption of enteric-coated drugs and <span class=\"nowrap\">timed/delayed-release</span> medications. When feasible, alternative methods for medication delivery (eg, liquid, transdermal, suppositories) should be used and medication levels should be monitored. (See <a href=\"#H2670286206\" class=\"local\">'Precautions for orally administered medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SBS patients should be transitioned to oral feedings in a slow and stepwise manner over a period of weeks to months. Enteral nutrition requires constant reassessment of the absorptive state that changes as adaptation continues. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Management in adaptation phase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SBS remain at risk for dehydration and require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. Measures to decrease intestinal fluid loss include avoidance of hypertonic and hypotonic fluids and the use of an oral rehydration solution to maintain hydration. (See <a href=\"#H111555116\" class=\"local\">'Fluid management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We reserve the use of the intestinotrophic factor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teduglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teduglutide</a>, in SBS in those patients who are unable to be weaned from parenteral nutrition despite aggressive use of the more conventional measures, particularly in those who have developed significant complications or describe severe impairment in quality of life related to parenteral nutrition use. Autologous gastrointestinal reconstruction procedures are reserved for patients with persistent intestinal failure due to SBS and only after the period of maximal intestinal adaptation. Indications for small bowel transplantation include a lifelong need for parenteral nutrition and irreversible complications of parenteral nutrition (eg, impending or overt liver failure, thrombosis of major central venous channels, frequent central line related sepsis) or an inability to manage <span class=\"nowrap\">hydration/nutrition</span> status despite parenteral nutrition.
