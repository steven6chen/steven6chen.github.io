Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is most often a result of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). The clinical presentation is characterized by the development of dyspnea associated with the rapid accumulation of fluid within the lung's interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alveolar spaces, which is the result of acutely elevated cardiac filling pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-cardiogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>ADHF is most commonly due to left ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction, with or without additional cardiac pathology, such as coronary artery disease or valve abnormalities. However, a variety of conditions or events can cause cardiogenic pulmonary edema in the absence of heart disease, including primary fluid overload (eg, due to blood transfusion), severe hypertension, renal artery stenosis, and severe renal disease.</p><p>Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is a distinct clinical syndrome associated with diffuse filling of the alveolar spaces in the absence of elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-cardiogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Focused history, physical examination, echocardiography, laboratory analysis and, in some cases, direct measurement of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure can be used to distinguish cardiogenic from noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, as well as from other causes of acute respiratory distress. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute decompensated heart failure in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiogenic-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema&quot;</a>.)</p><p>&ldquo;Flash&rdquo; pulmonary edema is a term that is used to describe a particularly dramatic form of cardiogenic alveolar pulmonary edema. In &ldquo;flash&rdquo; pulmonary edema, the underlying pathophysiologic principles, etiologic triggers, and initial management strategies are similar to those of less severe ADHF, although there is a greater degree of urgency to the implementation of initial therapies and the search for triggering causes. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Precipitating factors'</a> below.) Often, &ldquo;flash&rdquo; pulmonary edema is related to a sudden rise in left-sided intracardiac filling pressures in the setting of hypertensive emergency, acute ischemia, new onset tachyarrhythmia, or obstructive valvular disease. In addition to standard therapies for cardiogenic pulmonary edema, this condition responds well to combined venous and arterial vasodilators.</p><p>General issues related to the pathophysiology and etiology of cardiogenic pulmonary edema will be reviewed here.

This occurs in the absence of a primary change in the permeability or integrity of the endothelial and epithelial layers of the pulmonary capillaries. The net result is filtration of protein-poor liquid across the pulmonary endothelium into the pulmonary interstitium and alveolar spaces, leading to decreased diffusing capacity, hypoxia, and shortness of breath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-cardiogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">The Starling relationship</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid balance between the interstitium and vascular bed in the lung, as in other microcirculations, is determined by the Starling relationship, which predicts the net flow of liquid across a membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-cardiogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

Stress failure of pulmonary capillaries is manifest as high-permeability edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alveolar hemorrhage. Pulmonary capillary stress failure may occur in some patients with flash pulmonary edema with abrupt severe increases in pulmonary capillary pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-cardiogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

With acute rises in pulmonary capillary pressure, the pulmonary lymphatics cannot rapidly increase the rate of fluid removal; as a result, pulmonary edema occurs at pulmonary capillary pressures as low as 18 mmHg. In contrast, patients with chronic heart failure, in whom the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is persistently elevated, have increased lymphatic capacity and do not develop pulmonary edema until significantly higher pulmonary capillary pressures are reached.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When considering the etiologies of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, it is useful to distinguish the chronic cardiac conditions that predispose to episodes of pulmonary edema from the triggers that precipitate pulmonary edema.</p><p>The chronic conditions that predispose to heart failure (HF) are presented in detail separately. For the purposes of this discussion, some of the more common conditions leading to HF and cardiogenic pulmonary edema (eg, left ventricular [LV] systolic and diastolic dysfunction) are reviewed briefly here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of heart failure&quot;, section on 'Predisposing conditions for HF'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Systolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired LV contractility, resulting in reduced cardiac output, is the most common predisposing condition leading to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

The compensatory renal sodium and water retention induced by these adaptations ultimately result in pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure: Neurohumoral adaptations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diastolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diastolic dysfunction refers to an increase in ventricular stiffness (reduced compliance) and impaired relaxation that impedes ventricular filling during diastole. It can be induced by chronic disorders, such as left ventricular hypertrophy of any etiology or hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathies, and acutely with ischemia and acute hypertensive crisis. The net effect of diastolic dysfunction is an increased end-diastolic pressure for any given end-diastolic volume. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the elevated end-diastolic pressure, additional factors that may promote the development of pulmonary edema in patients with diastolic dysfunction include concurrent systolic dysfunction, reduced diastolic coronary blood flow (resulting in subendocardial ischemia), and tachycardia (eg, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Not all cases of cardiogenic pulmonary edema in patients with normal ejection fraction are due primarily to intrinsic abnormalities of LV diastolic function. Other causes include volume overload (as in renal failure) and increased afterload (as in hypertensive crisis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-cardiogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Chronic LV outflow obstruction is associated with a hypertrophied LV wall, which can produce diastolic and, over time, systolic dysfunction.

It is now less often seen in the United States, but is still a major cardiac problem in the third world. The chronic obstruction to atrial outflow leads to elevated left atrial pressures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.) Mitral annular calcification is a rare cause of symptomatic mitral stenosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of mitral annular calcification&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The typically slow progression of the disease allows gradual adaptation to the increased pressures and patients with mild to moderate degrees of stenosis are not typically symptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Role of lymphatics'</a> above.) However, conditions that cause an elevated heart rate and decreased diastolic filling time, such as poorly rate-controlled atrial fibrillation or exercise, can lead to acute elevations of left atrial pressures, and pulmonary edema.

Patients with renovascular disease may be predisposed to pulmonary edema because of chronic hypertension and secondary diastolic dysfunction and also from excess sodium and water retention secondary to activation of the renin-angiotensin system and associated renal dysfunction, resulting in chronically elevated filling pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-cardiogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is characterized by increased transudation of protein-poor fluid into the pulmonary interstitium and alveolar spaces. The primary etiologic factor is a rapid and acute increase in left ventricular filling pressures and left atrial pressure, usually associated with a reduction in cardiac output. Fluid exchange between the interstitium and vascular bed in the lung, as in other microcirculations, is determined by Starling forces, which govern the net flow of liquid across a membrane. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic conditions that predispose to acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and resultant pulmonary edema include disorders causing systolic dysfunction, those causing diastolic dysfunction, causes of left ventricular outflow obstruction, and causes of mitral stenosis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Predisposing conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precipitating factors that promote development of cardiogenic pulmonary edema include myocardial ischemia or infarction, acute aortic regurgitation, acute mitral regurgitation, renovascular hypertension, acute left atrial outflow impairment, and other causes of volume overload. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Precipitating factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Flash&rdquo; pulmonary edema is a term that is used to describe a dramatic form of ADHF, caused by an acute increase in left ventricular diastolic pressure as may occur with myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction, acute severe mitral regurgitation, hypertensive crisis, acute aortic regurgitation, and stress-induced (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Precipitating factors'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-cardiogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ware LB, Matthay MA.
