The depigmented areas are often symmetrical and usually increase in size with time. Given the contrast between the white patches and areas of normal skin, the disease is most disfiguring in darker skin types and has a profound impact on the quality of life of children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Patients with vitiligo often experience stigmatization, isolation, and low self-esteem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p>Although there is no cure for the disease, the available treatments may halt the progression of the disease and induce varying degrees of repigmentation with acceptable cosmetic results in many cases.

The percentage of the body area involved can be estimated by the so-called 1 percent rule or &quot;palm method.&quot; In both children and adults, the palm of the hand, including the fingers, is approximately 1 percent of the total body surface area (TBSA), while the palm excluding the fingers is approximately 0.5 percent of the TBSA. An alternative method is the &quot;rule of nines&quot;:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each leg represents 18 percent of the TBSA.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each arm represents 9 percent of the TBSA.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anterior and posterior trunk each represent 18 percent of the TBSA.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The head represents 9 percent of the TBSA.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H340124359\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of treatment for vitiligo should be set with the individual patient or parents in the case of children, based upon the patient's age and skin type, the extent, location, and degree of disease activity, and the impact of the disease on the patient's quality of life. An open discussion with the patient about the limitations of treatment may be helpful to create realistic expectations.</p><p>Nonsegmental vitiligo has an unpredictable course, and treatment is often challenging. However, multiple therapies, including topical agents, light therapies, and autologous grafting procedures, have demonstrated efficacy for repigmentation of vitiligo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The response to treatments is generally slow and may be highly variable among patients and among different body areas in the same patient. The best outcomes are often achieved in darker skin types (Fitzpatrick IV to VI), although satisfactory results are often seen also in lighter skin types (Fitzpatrick II, III). Facial and truncal lesions respond well to treatment, while acral areas are extremely difficult to treat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4160089632\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial aspects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's psychologic profile and ability to cope with a lifelong disease should be carefully evaluated at the time of treatment planning. Psychologic support should be offered to patients if needed. (See <a href=\"#H429331720\" class=\"local\">'Psychologic interventions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4060495227\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to the management of patients with vitiligo is generally consistent with published guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Topical, systemic, and light-based therapies are available for the stabilization and repigmentation of vitiligo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F107691\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107691 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. Treatment modalities are chosen in the individual patient on the basis of the disease severity, patient preference (including cost and accessibility), and response evaluation. Combination therapies, such as phototherapy plus topical or oral corticosteroids, are usually more effective than single therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Despite treatment, however, vitiligo has a highly unpredictable course, and the long-term persistence of repigmentation cannot be predicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2713141145\"><span class=\"h2\">Stabilization of rapidly progressive disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who experience rapid progression of vitiligo, with depigmented macules spreading over a few weeks or months, we suggest low-dose oral corticosteroids as first-line therapy for the stabilization (cessation of spread) of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F107691\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107691 \">table 1</a>). Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is given at the dose of 5 to 10 mg per day in children and 10 to 20 mg per day in adults for a maximum of two weeks. If needed, treatment can be repeated in four to six weeks.</p><p>In adult patients, alternatives to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> include oral mini-pulse therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 2.5 mg on two consecutive days weekly for an average of three months or intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> 40 mg in a single administration. Treatment with triamcinolone can be repeated in four to six weeks for a maximum of three injections. (See <a href=\"#H1634441845\" class=\"local\">'Systemic corticosteroids'</a> below.)</p><p>Stabilization therapy can be given with or without concomitant narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy. However, for patients with active disseminated disease affecting multiple anatomic sites, we suggest that systemic corticosteroids and NB-UVB phototherapy be initiated concomitantly. The disease is expected to stabilize in one to three months.</p><p>In both adults and children in whom systemic corticosteroids are contraindicated, NB-UVB phototherapy alone may be used to stabilize active vitiligo. NB-UVB is administered two to three times weekly. (See <a href=\"#H1602139008\" class=\"local\">'Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4264468486\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitiligo involving &lt;10 percent of the TBSA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3628101233\"><span class=\"h3\">Localized disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with nonsegmental stable vitiligo (no increase in size of existing lesions and absence of new lesions in the previous three to six months) that involves &lt;10 percent of the total body surface area (TBSA) and is limited to the face, neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F107625\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107625 \">picture 1</a>), trunk, or extremities, mid- to high-potency topical corticosteroids (groups two to four (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 2</a>)) are the first-line therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19</a>]. High-potency and mid-potency topical corticosteroids are applied to the involved skin once and twice daily, respectively. Agents with negligible systemic or local side effects, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mometasone</a> furoate, are preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2011942643\" class=\"local\">'Topical corticosteroids'</a> below.)</p><p>There are no studies evaluating the optimal duration of treatment with topical corticosteroids. In the author's experience, topical corticosteroids can be used safely for two to three months, interrupted for one month, and then resumed for an additional two or three months. Others suggest a discontinuous scheme (eg, once-daily application for 15 days per month for six months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/11,12,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,20</a>].</p><p>Patients must be monitored closely for adverse effects of topical corticosteroids, which include skin atrophy, telangiectasias, hypertrichosis, and acneiform eruptions. Limited quantities should be prescribed.</p><p>Topical calcineurin inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimecrolimus</a>) are the preferred first-line therapy in patients with limited disease involving the face or areas at high risk for skin atrophy. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are generally applied twice daily. They can also be used in combination with a topical corticosteroid for the first month or two, applying each one once daily. (See <a href=\"#H2903713534\" class=\"local\">'Topical calcineurin inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with limited disease who do not respond to topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors, targeted phototherapy administered twice weekly is an option (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F107629\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107629 \">picture 2</a>).

NB-UVB phototherapy is administered two to three times weekly. In the author's experience, less than 50 treatments are usually sufficient to achieve optimal outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H1602139008\" class=\"local\">'Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3325766253\"><span class=\"h3\">Segmental vitiligo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or targeted phototherapy are the first-line therapy for segmental vitiligo. (See <a href=\"#H2011942643\" class=\"local\">'Topical corticosteroids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2903713534\" class=\"local\">'Topical calcineurin inhibitors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H140160000\" class=\"local\">'Targeted phototherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>NB-UVB phototherapy can be used for more extensive disease affecting multiple dermatomes. For patients who do not respond to topical or light therapies, autologous grafting is a second-line option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Given the stable nature of segmental vitiligo, long-term repigmentation can be achieved with autologous melanocyte transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1602139008\" class=\"local\">'Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3713747503\" class=\"local\">'Surgical therapies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2528668101\"><span class=\"h3\">Localized recalcitrant vitiligo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical procedures are a therapeutic option for patients with localized stable vitiligo that does not respond to topical agents or NB-UVB phototherapy. Autologous grafting techniques include 1-mm punch grafts, suction blister grafts, or cellular suspensions. While all these techniques have proven success, most are technically challenging and expensive. One-millimeter punch grafts, however, can be performed with ease and without the need of special devices or equipment. (See <a href=\"#H3713747503\" class=\"local\">'Surgical therapies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2668512623\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitiligo involving 10 to 40 percent of the TBSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For adults and children with stable nonsegmental vitiligo involving 10 to 40 percent of the TBSA, we suggest NB-UVB as first-line therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F107628\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107628 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1602139008\" class=\"local\">'Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>NB-UVB is administered two to three times per week for an average of 9 to 12 months. Follicular areas of repigmentation usually begin to appear after 15 to 20 NB-UVB treatments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F107627\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107627 \">picture 4</a>). If patients are responding well with continued repigmentation, treatment can be maintained beyond 9 to 12 months and up to 24 months or 200 sessions and then tapered off. Mid-potency topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors are often intermittently used in combination with phototherapy.</p><p>Home NB-UVB phototherapy is an option for patients unable to travel to the clinician's office for weekly treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Whole-body or portable, handheld units are available on the market (sample brand names include Daavlin, National Biological Solarc Systems). Patients should be provided with detailed instructions on the use of the home phototherapy units and return for in-office clinician follow-up on a regular basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1880588927\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitiligo involving &gt;40 percent of the TBSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NB-UVB is the first-line therapy for patients with extensive vitiligo involving greater than 40 percent of the TBSA. The suggested regimen and duration of treatment are similar to that discussed above for patients with more limited disease. (See <a href=\"#H2668512623\" class=\"local\">'Vitiligo involving 10 to 40 percent of the TBSA'</a> above.)</p><p>However, for patients with extensive recalcitrant vitiligo that does not respond to repigmentation regimens and for patients with extensive vitiligo who do not desire undergoing repigmentation treatments, depigmentation of residual normally pigmented areas utilizing topical monobenzyl ether of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a> (monobenzone) may be an option. Depigmentation therapy is usually initiated with monobenzone 10% cream for one month and then continued with monobenzone 20% cream. Monobenzone is applied on the areas of residual pigmentation once or twice daily; we typically treat exposed areas first. These sites include the face, neck, upper extremities, chest, and lower legs. Depigmentation usually begins at distant sites (where the drug has not been applied) after three to six months of continued use. Depigmentation therapy may require one to three years to achieve optimal outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H2931229547\" class=\"local\">'Depigmentation'</a> below.)</p><p>Side effects of monobenzone are dose-dependent and include irritant contact dermatitis and severe xerosis. Monobenzone should <strong>never</strong> be used as a lightening agent in cases other than vitiligo. It will induce vitiligo in normal individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4083146597\"><span class=\"h2\">Response assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial response to treatment is in most cases indicated by the appearance of perifollicular areas of repigmentation in the vitiliginous patch, which usually begins 8 to 12 weeks after the initiation of treatment or after 15 to 20 NB-UVB sessions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F107627\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107627 \">picture 4</a>). Some patients may show a diffuse repigmentation pattern or a combination of diffuse and perifollicular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Photographs should be taken before starting treatment and at each follow-up visit to evaluate the degree of repigmentation.</p><p>In patients who respond well to treatment and achieve optimal repigmentation, therapies can be gradually tapered and then discontinued. However, some patients may require maintenance treatment. Intermittent use of topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors (eg, twice weekly) and phototherapy every other week may be used as long-term maintenance treatments. For patients who relapse after stopping treatment or during the maintenance phase, another cycle of phototherapy can be administered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1441102658\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT MODALITIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1528288886\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical therapies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2011942643\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mid- to super-high-potency topical corticosteroids are commonly used as a first-line therapy for the treatment of limited vitiligo. Their efficacy is attributed to modulation of the immune response.</p><p>The efficacy of topical corticosteroids as monotherapy for the treatment of vitiligo is supported by a few small randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A systematic review of 17 randomized trials examined the effect of topical corticosteroids in combination with other therapies (eg, narrowband ultraviolet B [NB-UVB], psoralen plus ultraviolet A with sunlight [PUVAsol], excimer laser) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The combination of potent or super-potent topical corticosteroids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> dipropionate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mometasone</a> furoate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate) with light therapies is more effective than light therapies alone in inducing repigmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. However, the quality of studies was generally poor, and the study results could not be pooled because of considerable heterogeneity in study design and outcome measure.</p><p>Adverse effects related to a prolonged use of topical corticosteroids, including folliculitis, mild atrophy, telangiectasia, and hypertrichosis, have been reported, generally in a small number of patients, in nearly all studies.

In a subsequent randomized trial including 55 patients with skin type III to VI and vitiligo involving 15 to 50 percent of the BSA, patients in the NB-UVB plus afamelanotide group achieved a greater repigmentation than patients in the NB-UVB monotherapy group at five months (49 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-management-and-prognosis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prostaglandin E2</strong> &ndash; Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a potentially beneficial treatment for localized stable vitiligo.

Of the 10 patients, three had 100 percent repigmentation, three had 75 to 99 percent repigmentation, and one patient had 50 to 75 percent repigmentation.

At 20 weeks, none of the patients achieved the prespecified end point of 50 to 75 percent repigmentation. However, in a post-hoc analysis using a less stringent definition of response (25 to 50 percent repigmentation), patients treated with bimatoprost, either alone or with mometasone, achieved a greater repigmentation in the neck and trunk than patients treated with mometasone alone. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Topical </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ruxolitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ruxolitinib</a> &ndash; Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.

Camouflage products include foundation-based cosmetics and self-tanning products containing dihydroxyacetone (DHA). DHA-based products are most popular because they provide lasting color for up to several days and are not immediately rubbed off onto clothing. Tattooing or micropigmentation should be avoided, given the risk of koebnerization and oxidation of tattoo pigment causing further dyschromia.

The goals of treatment include the stabilization of active disease and the repigmentation of depigmented patches. However, the response to treatments is slow and may be highly variable among patients and among different body areas in the same patient. (See <a href=\"#H1165203646\" class=\"local\">'Patient evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H452992676\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of severity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H340124359\" class=\"local\">'Goals of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with rapidly progressive vitiligo (ie, depigmented macules spreading over a few weeks or months), we suggest systemic corticosteroids as adjunct therapy to narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy for stabilization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2713141145\" class=\"local\">'Stabilization of rapidly progressive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with vitiligo involving &lt;10 percent of the total body surface area (TBSA), we suggest topical corticosteroids as initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Topical corticosteroids are applied once daily for two to three months and then interrupted for one month. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are preferred to topical corticosteroids for body areas at increased risk of atrophy. Targeted phototherapy is an option for patients with limited vitiligo who do not respond to topical therapies. (See <a href=\"#H4264468486\" class=\"local\">'Vitiligo involving &lt;10 percent of the TBSA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with vitiligo involving 10 to 40 percent of the TBSA, we suggest phototherapy with NB-UVB (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Phototherapy is administered two to three times per week for 9 to 12 months or up to 200 treatments. Topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors may be intermittently used in combination with NB-UVB phototherapy. (See <a href=\"#H2668512623\" class=\"local\">'Vitiligo involving 10 to 40 percent of the TBSA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical therapies involving the autologous transplantation of healthy melanocytes in depigmented areas are an option for patients with localized, recalcitrant vitiligo and for patients with segmental vitiligo.
