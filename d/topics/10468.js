It is a disorder characterized by ischemic necrosis of the intestinal mucosa, which is associated with inflammation, invasion of enteric gas forming organisms, and dissection of gas into the muscularis and portal venous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although early recognition and aggressive treatment of this disorder have improved clinical outcomes, NEC accounts for substantial long-term morbidity in survivors of neonatal intensive care, particularly in premature very low birth weight infants (birth weight below 1500 g).</p><p>The management of NEC depends upon the severity of illness as classified by the Bell staging criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54166 \">table 1</a>). Medical management is appropriate in most cases. However, infants with advanced NEC and bowel perforation (stage IIIB) require surgical intervention. Care for the infant with (or suspected) NEC is provided by a multi-disciplinary team, which includes surgical consultation that assists the neonatology team in the evaluation and management of the infant, and decides if and when surgery is needed.</p><p>The treatment and outcome of NEC will be reviewed here. The pathology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention of this disorder are discussed separately.

Since 20 to 30 percent of neonates with NEC have concomitant bacteremia, empiric regimens should provide coverage for pathogens that cause late-onset bacteremia. Anaerobic coverage should be considered, especially if peritonitis or pneumoperitoneum, suggesting intestinal perforation, are suspected or confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, in one retrospective multicenter study, there was no difference in the composite outcome of death or intestinal strictures between patients exposed to anaerobic antimicrobial therapy versus matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among infants who underwent a surgical procedure, mortality was less likely in the group exposed to anaerobic antimicrobial therapy (odds ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.95). This study had some major limitations because of the cohort design, especially because matching was challenging, as it resulted in the exclusion of nearly 60 percent of the sample population.</p><p>Thus, there is inadequate evidence to support a specific regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In the early stages of illness, we obtain a complete blood count and differential, platelet count, serum electrolyte and creatinine measurements, blood urea nitrogen, and acid-base studies approximately every 12 to 24 hours. Some centers also monitor serial lactate levels.</p><p>In particular, low platelet count, metabolic acidosis, and increasing blood glucose are associated with worsening or persisting NEC. Normalization of these studies suggests improvement in the infant's condition, whereas persistently abnormal or worsening results suggest no change or further deterioration in the patient's clinical status. Specific abnormalities, such as thrombocytopenia, may require more frequent testing to evaluate the need for and response to treatment.</p><p>Some clinicians monitor stools for blood to follow the course of the disease; however, there is not confirmatory evidence showing that this approach is predictive of outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographic monitoring is an important guide to the diagnosis and progression of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78676\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78676 \">image 1</a>). We obtain an abdominal radiograph in the supine position every 6 to 12 hours during the initial phase of illness. Films in the lateral decubitus view with the infant's left side down also are obtained in order to visualize the presence of free air over the liver. If the infant does not tolerate being moved and pneumoperitoneum is suspected, a supine cross-table lateral view is substituted.</p><p>The severity of NEC based upon Bell's criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54166 \">table 1</a>) is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 1 (suspected NEC) is characterized by nonspecific radiologic signs (temperature instability, apnea and bradycardia, lethargy, mild abdominal distension).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2 (proven NEC) is characterized by the radiographic findings of pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous gas, and mild metabolic acidosis and ileus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3 (advanced NEC) is characterized by the finding of pneumatosis intestinalis plus significant systemic signs (eg, severe metabolic acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]) and subsequent perforation.</p><p/><p>As the infant improves, usually within two to three days, radiographs also improve and are obtained less frequently. Radiographic monitoring is discontinued when the pneumatosis resolves and bowel gas pattern normalizes. The diagnosis of pneumatosis also has been documented by point-of-care ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16139925\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is suspected or confirmed, a pediatric surgeon is consulted to assist the neonatology team in the evaluation and management of the infant, and to decide if and when surgery is needed. The timing of surgical intervention in a critically ill infant requires considerable judgment, as one wishes to preserve as much bowel length as possible, but an unstable patient may not be able to tolerate the surgical procedure.</p><p>Infants with NEC require surgical intervention when necrosis extends through the bowel wall and results in perforation. The decision to perform surgery is clear when pneumoperitoneum is recognized on the abdominal radiograph. However, peritonitis, extensive necrosis, or perforation can occur without evidence of free air on the radiograph. As a result, other signs that indicate peritonitis must be considered, including unremitting clinical deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], the presence of an abdominal mass, ascites, or intestinal obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372680353\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical procedures performed in infants with NEC include either exploratory laparotomy with resection of the affected intestinal region(s), or primary peritoneal drainage (PPD). Although laparotomy is more commonly performed, it is uncertain which procedure is most effective. Based upon the following limited data, peritoneal drainage appears to be a reasonable alternative to laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In particular, PPD may be the preferred initial surgical procedure in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (birth weight &lt;1000 g) because it can be performed at the bedside under local anesthesia. In contrast, laparotomy usually requires transport to the operating room and general anesthesia, and may require a second surgical procedure for reanastomosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary peritoneal drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary peritoneal drainage (PPD) is performed at the bedside in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). After the administration of pain medication, the abdomen is prepped with iodine solution, and local anesthesia is administered. A small transverse incision is made at McBurney's point (midway between the umbilicus and the anterior superior iliac crest in the right lower quadrant). The layers of the abdominal wall are bluntly dissected to enter the peritoneal cavity. In many cases, there will be a rush of air and the presence of meconium encountered. Cultures are taken, the peritoneal cavity is copiously irrigated with warm saline solution, and a Penrose drain is gently threaded into the abdomen and secured.</p><p>The drain site is observed over the subsequent days. When there is no evidence of persistent intestinal or meconium drainage from the drain site, the drain is backed out daily until it is removed. After the return of bowel function, a trial of feeding can be started or the patency of the gastrointestinal tract can be determined with a contrast study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparotomy usually involves resection of the affected bowel segment, and placement of a proximal enterostomy (usually an ileostomy) and distal mucous fistula. Reanastomosis, if required, usually is performed 8 to 12 weeks after the initial procedure, depending upon the infant's clinical condition. A contrast enema usually is performed before the reanastomosis to detect intestinal strictures. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Stricture formation'</a> below.)</p><p>If NEC affects only a short segment of bowel, and the resection is limited, some surgeons perform a primary anastomosis. This procedure avoids the development of complications associated with ileostomies, including fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, delayed resumption of oral feedings, poor growth, and stenosis of the enterostomy site. An alternative approach is placement of an intestinal patch and peritoneal drain instead of resection and enterostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>When a substantial length of bowel is affected, resection is restricted to segments of definite necrosis or perforation to avoid the risk of short bowel syndrome. If the potential viability of some segments is uncertain, one approach is to place peritoneal drains and plan a second operation in two to three days to reexamine the bowel and excise necrotic segments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16139931\"><span class=\"h3\">Comparison of procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outcome between the two procedures (laparotomy versus PPD) appears to be equivocal based on the data from the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter controlled study of 117 infants (&lt;34 weeks gestation) with perforated NEC, there were no differences between PPD and laparotomy in mortality rate (34.5 versus 35.5 percent, respectively) and the need for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> at 90 days postoperatively (47.2 versus 40 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Length of hospital stay between PPD and laparotomy was similar (126 &plusmn; 58 versus 116 &plusmn; 56 days, respectively). This study was designed to enroll 130 patients that would detect a reduction of a mortality rate from 50 to 25 percent with an 80 percent certainty (power). Because of loss of funding, the actual enrollment of 117 infants reduced the ability to detect a difference of this magnitude to 77 percent or less. As a result, clinically significant effects, especially those that were smaller than the primary outcome of 50 to 25 percent mortality reduction, may have been missed because of an insufficient number of enrolled patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A smaller randomized multicenter trial of 69 extremely low birthweight (ELBW) infants (birth weight &le;1000 g) with pneumoperitoneum due to bowel perforation from NEC or spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) also demonstrated no difference in the survival rates between the patients treated with PPD and those who underwent laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, 26 of 35 infants (74 percent) treated with PPD failed to improve with only drainage and subsequently required laparotomy and bowel resection. In a subsequent report, there were no postprocedural differences in heart rate, blood pressure, inotrope requirement, oxygenation status, and organ failure rate between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although the authors concluded that PPD did not offer additional benefit over laparotomy, the sample size of the trial was inadequately powered to detect short-term physiologic changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort study from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network demonstrated no difference in mortality rate between the two surgical approaches in ELBW infants with either NEC or SIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Nine of 37 (24 percent) survivors treated with PPD required subsequent laparotomy. However, PPD was more likely to result in a composite outcome of death or neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months postmenstrual age. However, this was not a randomized trial, and treatment was based upon the judgment of the attending pediatric surgeon and neonatology team. As a result, there were potentially important differences between the two treatment groups at baseline that favored the outcome of patients undergoing laparotomy, because PPD was performed in infants who were more premature (gestational age 24.7 versus 25.7 weeks), were more likely to be hypotensive, required more respiratory support, and were more likely to have a preoperative diagnosis of SIP.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At our institution, current management consists of PPD in ELBW infants and monitoring their status with serial abdominal examinations and radiographic studies. In addition, medical intervention including supportive care and antibiotic therapy is administered to all patients who undergo surgical procedures. After a period of approximately one to two weeks, the drain is removed, and the clinical exam is followed. In most cases that have shown clinical improvement, a contrast enema is obtained prior to feeding to detect stricture formation. However, in many cases, the infant spontaneously passes stool after the drain is removed, so feedings may begin without a contrast study. The sequelae of bowel stricture must be considered if any further feeding problems arise. Laparotomy is indicated in patients who fail to respond to PPD.

Medical management is appropriate in most cases. However, infants with advanced NEC and bowel perforation (stage IIIB) require surgical intervention. Care for the infant with (or suspected) NEC is provided by a multidisciplinary team, which includes surgical consultation that assists the neonatology team in the evaluation and management of the infant, and decides if and when surgery is needed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical management should be initiated promptly when NEC is suspected. It includes the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Supportive care &ndash; Supportive care includes bowel rest, gastric decompression with intermittent nasogastric suction, discontinuation of enteral intake, initiation of parenteral nutrition, correction of metabolic and hematologic abnormalities, and stabilization of the cardiac and respiratory function. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antibiotic therapy &ndash; After obtaining appropriate specimens for culture, we recommend a course of parenteral antibiotics that cover a broad range of aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). The empiric regimen should include coverage for organisms causing late-onset sepsis, because 20 to 30 percent of infants with NEC have concomitant bacteremia. The chosen regimen should take into consideration patterns of resistance among Gram-negative enteric organisms at the individual institution. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The clinical status is monitored by laboratory studies (eg, white cell and platelet count, and serum bicarbonate and glucose measurements) and abdominal radiography to see if the patient responds to medical management, or if the NEC continues to progress and if (and when) surgical intervention is required. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical intervention is required either when intestinal perforation occurs or when there is unremitting clinical deterioration despite medical management suggesting extensive necrosis. We suggest primary peritoneal drainage (PPD) as the initial surgical intervention for NEC, especially in extremely low birth weight infants (birth weight &lt;1000 g) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Response to PPD is monitored by serial abdominal examinations and radiographic studies. An alternative option is laparotomy with bowel excision. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Surgical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prognosis of NEC has improved with earlier recognition and treatment, with survival rates of about 70 to 80 percent of affected infants. In addition, approximately one-half of the survivors are normal. Long-term sequelae include gastrointestinal complications (eg, short bowel syndrome, intestinal strictures, and increased frequency of bowel movements with loose stools) and impairment of growth and neurodevelopmental outcome.
