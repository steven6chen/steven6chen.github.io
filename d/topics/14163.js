In many clinical situations, liver resection, when possible, provides the best survival outcomes. However, the limits of liver resection are determined by the probability of leaving behind a safe volume of functional liver that has an adequate vascular inflow, venous outflow, and biliary drainage. </p><p>The generally accepted safe minimum threshold for the future liver remnant (FLR) varies from 20 to 25 percent for a normal liver to &gt;40 percent for a cirrhotic liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. If the FLR volume is deemed unsafe or marginal, adjunctive or alternative methods to ensure an adequate postresection liver volume may include a staged resection, the associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy procedure, a hybrid procedure that combines liver resection with ablation techniques, and portal vein occlusion techniques such as preoperative portal vein ligation (PVL) or preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE).<strong> </strong></p><p>Preoperative PVE is the elective obliteration of portal blood flow to a selected portion of the liver a few weeks prior to planned major liver resection. PVE initiates hypertrophy of the anticipated FLR. Preoperative PVE is a valuable adjunct to major liver resection, particularly for right-sided tumors, and it may allow a more extensive resection or staged bilateral resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. The indications, contraindications, and techniques for PVE and a comparison of PVE with other techniques are reviewed here.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatic-resection#H1124058604\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatic resection&quot;, section on 'Preoperative imaging'</a>.)</p><p>A clear understanding and application of appropriate estimation of the volume and function of the liver is an important aspect of patient selection. Many methods are in clinical use, and each has advantages and disadvantages. There is always a discrepancy between the measured or estimated volume and the actual weight, as demonstrated from graft weight measurements in living donor liver transplantation. The same applies to functional assessment as well. </p><p>The reasons for such discrepancies include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assumption that the density of liver is 1.0 (ie, that the liver weight in grams = volume in mL). Although this is practically useful, the liver parenchyma is actually denser, and the conversion factor may be greater than 1.0. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assumption that liver parenchyma is homogenous. This is not true, as the proportion of the vasculobiliary components of the liver in relation to the hepatocellular mass is variable. Moreover, in patients with tumors, the size, number, and distribution will affect volumetry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In terms of function, the left lobe is marginally inferior to the right lobe even when corrected for volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2438396322\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver volumetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver volume can be measured using manual or software-assisted methods using a number of imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), or scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/3,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,13</a>]. Alternatively, liver volume may be estimated using validated formulas that use a combination of age, gender, and anthropometric parameters such as height, weight, and body surface area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Approximately 16 formulas are in use to derive estimated total liver volume (eTLV). The standardized functional liver remnant (sFLR) is the ratio between volumetrically measured FLR and the derived eTLV. Another method is the measured functional liver remnant (mFLR) in which both the remnant volume and the total liver volume are measured by CT volumetry. FLR in this method is usually expressed as a ratio of remnant volume to the total functional liver volume (total liver volume-tumor volume). </p><p>The chosen technique for measuring FLR depends upon the local availability of expertise and software. The results and principles of application are similar as long as the same technique is followed for both pre- and postembolization estimates. Thus, in the discussions below, we refer to FLR generically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2475090291\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional liver studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence from radionuclide studies that the increase in the functional capacity of the liver after preoperative PVE may be more than the increase in volumes that are measured using CT volumetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The increase in functional capacity can be measured by one of two radio nuclide techniques: <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labelled galactosyl-human serum albumin (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-GSA) or <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labelled mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The <sup>99m</sup>Tc-GSA technique relies on the binding of the tracer to specific receptors expressed on functional hepatocytes, while the labeled mebrofenin with SPECT is based on the uptake and excretion kinetics of mebrofenin by the hepatocytes. </p><p>Other techniques used for functional assessment include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> retention at 15 minutes (ICG-15), the <sup>13</sup>C-Methacetin breath test (LiMax test), and contrast-enhanced MR imaging using gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (gadolinium-EOB-DTPA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. ICG-15 is an accepted parameter for functional capacity of liver. A level &lt;10 percent is considered normal, although some labs quote a slightly higher value of up to 14 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2425761269\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM AND PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE) is the elective obliteration of portal blood flow to a selected portion of the liver a few weeks prior to planned major liver resection, with the intention of eliciting a hypertrophic physiologic response in the nonembolized portion. The purpose is to augment the volume and potentially the function of the future liver remnant (FLR) to a safe threshold and minimize the risk of post-hepatectomy liver failure and related complications such as sepsis, multiorgan failure, and mortality. Preoperative PVE usually takes the form of a right PVE, performed in preparation of a planned major right-sided resection such as an extended right hepatectomy (in a normal liver) or a right hepatectomy (in a cirrhotic liver). Very rarely, a left preoperative PVE may be indicated before a left-sided resection. </p><p>The sequela of selective portal vein occlusion, ipsilateral atrophy with contralateral hypertrophy, was first demonstrated in a rabbit model in 1920 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Forty years later, portal vein ligation was used as a part of a two-staged hepatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, the first PVE to facilitate safe liver resection was not reported until 1984 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The effectiveness of PVE has been documented for a variety of different cancers and in patients with varying clinical profiles. </p><p>The increase in liver volume is due to clonal expansion of the number of hepatocytes (hyperplasia) and not by an increase in size of existing hepatocytes (hypertrophy). Preoperative PVE causes immediate redistribution of portal blood flow to the nonembolized liver segments, which returns toward baseline levels by 11 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The increased flow stimulates a regenerative response. The arterial flow to the nonembolized segments is reduced only marginally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Key factors involved in the regenerative response include hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, insulin, noradrenaline, and cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The genes for some of these may be expressed as quickly as 30 minutes after hepatocyte injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>At four to six weeks after PVE, the expected increase of standardized FLR ranges from 8 to 13 percent, although some studies have reported higher rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/5,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24,25</a>]. When expressed as a percentage augmentation from baseline FLR (ie, without PVE), this corresponds to a 40 to 62 percent increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3767948694\" class=\"local\">'Liver volume and functional assessment'</a> above.) </p><p>The kinetics of liver regeneration following preoperative PVE are slower and of a different nature compared with those following liver resection. The rate of liver regeneration in normal liver peaks approximately two weeks after PVE at 12 to 21 cm<sup>3</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/day,</span> and plateaus by three weeks, with a rate at one month of approximately 6 to 11 cm<sup>3</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, studies have documented a continued growth of the liver up to one year post-PVE, with only about 25 percent of the total possible growth occurring in the first month, 50 percent by three months, and 75 percent by about eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Factors that adversely affect regeneration after PVE include increasing age, male gender, a high initial FLR volume, diabetes, cholestasis (with or without biliary drainage), and parenchymal liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/5,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28,29</a>]. Some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], but not all, studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/10,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,32,33</a>] have found a detrimental effect of prolonged pre-PVE chemotherapy on the volume gain.</p><p>The growth rate after PVE as well as the degree of hypertrophy (DH), which is the difference between the FLR percentage before and after PVE, have been shown to be important predictors of post-hepatectomy liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/15,25,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,25,34</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H305517573\" class=\"local\">'Functional liver remnant thresholds'</a> below.)</p><p>However, the probability of successful liver enlargement decreases as the volume of FLR that is needed increases.

The evolution of liver resection has lowered these thresholds. In the early experience, the FLR threshold in a normal liver for PVE in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma was 40 percent. In the early 2000s, the recommended minimum standardized FLR was lowered to 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/12,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,49</a>]. Further studies supported a threshold as low as 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/10,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,50,51</a>]. A consensus conference on resectability of liver metastasis in 2006 and another on multidisciplinary management of hepatocellular carcinoma in 2010 have endorsed the lower threshold of 20 percent minimum FLR in normal functioning livers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>Another point that should be kept in mind, particularly in a setting of hilar cholangiocarcinoma, is that PVE commits the surgeon to the ipsilateral resection. This often means an extended right hepatectomy. This places a significant constraint on the flexibility of operative decision making in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who have had a PVE. </p><p>In cirrhotic livers, in addition to the Child-Pugh status, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> retention at 15 minutes (ICG-R15) is often factored into treatment algorithms. As an example, a protocol from China considers Child B or Child C status to be contraindications to major hepatic resection (&gt;3 segments), and also an ICG-R15 of &gt;20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. But for patients with Child A cirrhosis, if the ICG-R15 is &lt;20 percent, then a minimum FLR of 30 percent is required for a right hepatectomy and 35 percent for an extended right hepatectomy.

However, the response in the left lateral segments is important, since segment IV would be resected and hence will not contribute to the FLR. Embolization of the segment IV portal vein branch along with the right portal vein (ie, extended embolization) was first reported in 2000 as right trisegment embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. If an ipsilateral approach to PVE is used, then segment IV embolization should be done first before right PVE; on the other hand, with a contralateral approach, the right PVE is done first before segment IV embolization. It is also essential to embolize the segment IV branches if segment IV is tumor bearing. Rarely, a left trisegment embolization, which includes embolization of the left main portal vein and the right anterior portal vein, may be indicated if the right posterior segment volume is deemed inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>There is evidence to suggest that with extended embolization, the rate and absolute increase in volume of segments II and III would be greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/78,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,80</a>].

A systematic review identified six studies comparing outcomes of patients undergoing major liver resection for colorectal liver metastases and found no significant differences in postoperative hepatic recurrence for those undergoing liver resection with or without PVE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2873096297\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison with other techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3364996795\"><span class=\"h3\">PVE versus portal vein ligation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Portal vein ligation (PVL),<strong> </strong>performed by laparotomy or by laparoscopy, is an alternative to PVE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

A meta-analysis of seven clinical studies involving 218 patients found that there was no significant difference when comparing PVE with PVL in terms of FLR hypertrophy (39 percent with PVE versus 27 percent with PVL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].

However, the magnitude of hypertrophic response is inferior to PVE (29 versus 61 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1504703925\"><span class=\"h3\">PVE versus the ALPPS procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ALPPS procedure is an alternative to preoperative PVE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/26,105-110\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,105-110</a>]. Although conceptually interesting, the patient is exposed to additional operative risk, and ALPPS is associated with high morbidity and mortality in most reported series. It has been suggested that this approach should only be used in highly selected patients. Salvage ALPPS may have a role in the treatment of patients who do not show an adequate hypertrophy response to preoperative PVE. When indicated, the procedure should be performed at hepatobiliary centers of excellence with experience with ALPPS. </p><p>ALPPS is a short-interval, two-staged liver resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. The first stage involves an open right PVL and in situ parenchymal transection in the right trisectionectomy plane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. The second stage is performed one to two weeks later and involves a right trisectionectomy. </p><p>The role of ALPPS in liver resection remains to be defined. The goal of this procedure is to provide an oncologically sound operation when there is a high likelihood of an inadequate FLR, as is often the case with bilateral disease. Data supporting ALPPS are limited, and preoperative PVE remains the preferred technique for patients with an inadequate FLR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Compared with PVE, ALPPS produces an accelerated hypertrophy of the FLR in a much shorter time interval. A small case series of patients undergoing ALPPS showed an average hypertrophy rate of 85 percent with major morbidity and mortality rates of 35 and 6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].

The extrapolated liver growth rate was 11 times higher with ALPPS (34.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> versus 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day)</span>.

The two deaths that followed PVE were due to late septic shock from cholangiolitic abscess, which may be attributed to PVE, and late pulmonary embolism. </p><p>Major complications are uncommon (2 to 3 percent) and include portal vein thrombosis, embolization of nontarget vessels, infection, bile leak, hemobilia, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, arterioportal shunt, liver hematoma, and pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/76,112-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,112-114</a>]. Variceal bleeding from rise in portal pressure has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].</p><p>Minor complications, such as fever and ill-defined abdominal discomfort with or without accompanying elevation of transaminases, are fairly common and self-limited, occurring in approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients. Transaminases peak at less than three times the normal values by post-PVE day 3 and return to baseline by 10 days. There may be a mild increase in bilirubin, but albumin and prothrombin time are not usually affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The dropout rate after PVE is approximately 25 percent for various reasons such as disease progression and inadequate hypertrophy, which occurs in approximately 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1338958162\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE) is the elective obliteration of portal blood flow to a selected portion of the liver a few weeks prior to planned major liver resection. PVE elicits a hypertrophic physiologic response in the nonembolized portion augmenting the volume and potentially the function of the future liver remnant (FLR) to a safe threshold to permit potentially curative liver resection. (See <a href=\"#H2772347224\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2425761269\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism and physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative PVE causes a modest increase in the standardized FLR in the range of 8 to 13 percent over a relatively short time period of four to six weeks. The absolute FLR percentage increase is between 40 and 60 percent of the baseline FLR volume. (See <a href=\"#H2425761269\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism and physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative PVE is primarily indicated when a marginal FLR precludes an otherwise potentially curative hepatectomy in selected patients with primary or metastatic liver tumors. Preoperative PVE is indicated if the FLR is (see <a href=\"#H2472470834\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&lt;20 percent in a normal liver </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&lt;30 percent in the context of <span class=\"nowrap\">cholestasis/hepatitis/chemotherapy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&lt;40 percent in Child A cirrhosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a small FLR that contraindicates hepatic resection, we suggest preoperative PVE, rather than no hepatic resection or an alternative procedure (eg, portal vein ligation [PVL], associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy [ALPPS]) prior to hepatic resection, provided there are no contraindications to the PVE (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Preoperative PVE is well tolerated and has a more favorable safety profile compared with available alternative techniques. (See <a href=\"#H2873096297\" class=\"local\">'Comparison with other techniques'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1401867828\" class=\"local\">'Disease-specific outcomes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1320620067\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In properly selected patients, preoperative PVE increases resectability rates and reduces the incidence of post-hepatectomy liver failure. Approximately 70 to 80 percent of patients who undergo preoperative PVE eventually undergo successful liver resection. Although the timing of hepatic resection varies, hepatic surgeons generally wait three to six weeks post-PVE before undertaking resection. (See <a href=\"#H421378028\" class=\"local\">'Timing of resection after PVE'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1401867828\" class=\"local\">'Disease-specific outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative PVE is typically performed via a percutaneous transhepatic approach in an interventional suite under conscious sedation with local anesthesia. When an extended right hepatectomy is planned, then extended embolization to include segment IV branches of the portal vein should be performed if technical expertise is available. An open surgical approach may be used if laparotomy is indicated for another purpose. (See <a href=\"#H3112775647\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3786205184\" class=\"local\">'Extended PVE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjunctive techniques to PVE include transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), concomitant segmental arterial ligation, hepatic vein embolization, and stem cell transplantation. For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, sequential TACE-PVE has volumetric as well as survival benefits. (See <a href=\"#H2881503223\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive techniques'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-portal-vein-embolization/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Abdalla EK, Adam R, Bilchik AJ, et al.
