It can cause pain in the lower part of the belly and trouble getting pregnant.</p><p>Endometriosis occurs when tissue normally found in a woman's uterus grows outside of the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78942\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78942 \">figure 1</a>). This tissue, which does not belong outside the uterus, can then break down, bleed, and cause symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463000866\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of endometriosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women with endometriosis have no symptoms. But most have pain in the lower part of the belly that can occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before or during monthly periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between monthly periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During or after sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When urinating or having a bowel movement (often during monthly periods)</p><p/><p>Other symptoms of endometriosis can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble getting pregnant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growths on the ovaries that a doctor can feel during an exam</p><p/><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not endometriosis. But if you have any of these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463000873\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for endometriosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. But your doctor or nurse might suspect you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p>The only way to know for sure if you have endometriosis is for a doctor to do surgery and look for endometriosis tissue outside the uterus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463000880\"><span class=\"h1\">How is endometriosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometriosis can be treated in different ways. The right treatment for you will depend on your symptoms and on whether you want to be able to get pregnant in the future.</p><p>Doctors can use medicines to treat endometriosis. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain medicines &ndash; There are medicines that can treat the pain caused by endometriosis. But these medicines do not make the endometriosis go away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth control medicines &ndash; Certain birth control medicines can help reduce pain symptoms. This treatment is not appropriate for women who are trying to get pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that stop monthly periods &ndash; These medicines stop the body from producing certain hormones. They can be helpful for women who do not improve with birth control medicines. For women who need to take them for longer than 6 months, doctors add treatment with other hormones.</p><p/><p>Some women choose to have surgery to treat endometriosis. Different types of surgery can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopy &ndash; In this type of surgery, a doctor will make a small cut in the belly and put a tube with a camera inside the body. Then he or she can see and remove endometriosis tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysterectomy &ndash; If no other treatments work, doctors might suggest a hysterectomy. This is surgery to remove a woman's uterus. Sometimes, the doctor will also remove the ovaries and tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57901\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57901 \">figure 2</a>). A woman cannot get pregnant after her uterus is removed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463000887\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am having trouble getting pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are having trouble getting pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse. There are different medicines and treatments that can help a woman get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463000894\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=painful-periods-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Painful periods (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing birth control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysterectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hysterectomy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Infertility in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic pelvic pain in women (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Endometriosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=painful-menstrual-periods-dysmenorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic pelvic pain in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Abdominal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ovulation induction with clomiphene (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-treatment-with-gonadotropins-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Infertility treatment with gonadotropins (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization-ivf-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: In vitro fertilization (IVF) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
