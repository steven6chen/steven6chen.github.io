As the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) declined in areas of the world where socioeconomic conditions were rapidly advancing, the frequency of isolating nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) began to increase, and their relevance to human disease became apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In 1959, Runyon proposed the first classification system for these organisms that divided human isolates of NTM into four groups on the basis of growth rates, colony morphology, and pigmentation in the presence and absence of light (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61936\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61936 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Though now outdated, this classification allowed mycobacterial laboratories to more readily identify individual species of NTM, resulting in clearer characterization of distinct diseases or syndromes associated with these organisms.</p><p>With the availability of 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and polymerase chain reaction-restriction length polymorphism analysis (PRA), the number of new species of NTM has risen dramatically with the naming of species such as <em>Mycobacterium genavense</em>, <em>Mycobacterium interjectum</em>, <em>Mycobacterium triplex</em>, <em>Mycobacterium celatum</em>, and <em>Mycobacterium lentiflavum</em>. Over 160 species have been recognized in the genus <em>Mycobacterium</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The microbiology of NTM will be reviewed here.

Less common human pathogens include the slowly growing species <em>Mycobacterium marinum</em>, <em>Mycobacterium xenopi</em>, <em>Mycobacterium simiae</em>, <em>Mycobacterium malmoense</em>, and <em>Mycobacterium ulcerans</em>, and the rapidly growing species <em>Mycobacterium abscessus</em>, <em>Mycobacterium fortuitum</em>, and <em>Mycobacterium chelonae</em>. Certain relatively common laboratory isolates, such as <em>Mycobacterium gordonae</em>, are important to clinicians because they often are contaminants and uncommonly are true pathogens.

Microscopic examination after staining and culture using specific media are the cornerstones of the identification of mycobacteria. All mycobacteria share the characteristic of &quot;acid-fastness,&quot; ie, after staining with carbol-fuchsin or auramine-rhodamine, they do not decolorize with acidified alcohol. Thus, the common term acid-fast bacilli (AFB) is essentially synonymous with mycobacteria. <em>Nocardia</em>, the main exception, is weakly or variably acid-fast, but often a modified acid fast stain is necessary to distinguish this characteristic in <em>Nocardia</em> species. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of nocardiosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Specimens may be stained with the Ziehl-Neelsen stain or one of its modifications, such as the Kinyoun stain, and examined by routine light microscopy. However, microscopy is relatively insensitive, since at least 10,000 organisms per milliliter of sputum are required for smear positivity. Thus, other procedures are often performed in order to increase the sensitivity of direct microscopy of clinical specimens.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most laboratories use a fluorochrome stain such as auramine-O or auramine-rhodamine and examine specimens by fluorescence microscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liquid specimens may be centrifuged first and the sediment stained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experienced microscopists may also detect mycobacteria in Gram stained specimens in which they appear as refractile gram positive or gram neutral rods. Under a 100x oil immersion objective, mycobacteria are slightly bent, often beaded rods 2 to 4 microns in length and 0.2 to 0.5 microns in width.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confirmation of the presence or absence of mycobacteria in clinical specimens has traditionally required culture, because of the relative insensitivity of direct microscopy. In general, clinical specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or serous fluids, can be inoculated directly onto media. In comparison, nonsterile specimens, such as sputum or pus, must be chemically decontaminated first in order to eliminate common bacteria and fungi that would overwhelm the culture. However, decontamination procedures may inhibit the growth of mycobacteria, especially NTM, as well.</p><p>Clinical specimens for mycobacterial cultures should be inoculated onto one or more solid media (eg, Middlebrook 7H11 media <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Lowenstein-Jensen media, the former of which is the preferred medium for NTM) and into a liquid medium such as BACTEC 12B broth or Mycobacteria growth indicator tube [MGIT] broth. Growth of visible colonies on solid media typically requires two to four weeks generally at 35 to 37&ordm;C for slowly growing NTM and 30&ordm;C for rapidly growing NTM and <em>M. marinum</em>. Primary cultures in modern liquid media, such as the radiometric BACTEC system, usually produce results within 10 to 14 days. However, this method is not 100 percent sensitive; as a result, it supplements but does not replace traditional solid media.</p><p>Traditional methods of speciating mycobacterial isolates were based upon growth characteristics on solid media and subsequent biochemical tests, requiring additional weeks for subcultures. These time-consuming methods are being replaced with more rapid techniques. These techniques include specific nucleic acid probes, which are now available for the most common isolates (<em>M. tuberculosis</em> complex, <em>M. kansasii</em>, <em>M. avium</em> complex, and <em>M. gordonae</em>), and HPLC, which evaluates mycolic acid patterns in AFB smear-positive sputum samples (<em>M. tuberculosis </em>and MAC) and in primary positive cultures and permits identification of some species within hours. HPLC is, however, not sufficient for definitive species identification for many NTM species, including the rapidly growing mycobacteria.</p><p>Other newer techniques, which include polymerase chain reaction-restriction length polymorphism analysis (PRA), 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing, multi-gene sequencing, and whole genomic sequencing, also allow NTM to be identified and speciated more reliably and rapidly from clinical specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Cost considerations limit widespread adoption of these techniques. However, the recognition that <em>M. abscessus</em> can be separated into more than one subspecies and that there are important prognostic implications of that separation lends urgency to the broader adoption of newer molecular techniques in the mycobacteriology laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Susceptibility testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional methods of testing mycobacteria for susceptibility to antituberculosis drugs were developed for <em>M. tuberculosis</em> but may not apply directly to NTM (see below). The most common, called the proportion method, compares growth in media containing a specified concentration of the drug to growth in the absence of the drug. Colony growth on drug-containing media that exceeds one percent of the number of colonies growing in the absence of the drug indicates resistance to that drug. For liquid media, such as the BACTEC system, this procedure has been modified to yield comparable results.</p><p>Only one &quot;critical concentration&quot; of drug is usually tested in contrast to other common bacteria where many drug concentrations are tested, yielding the familiar &quot;MIC&quot; or minimum inhibitory concentration. For rapidly growing mycobacteria, a broth microdilution system similar to that used for bacterial species is the preferred method. The broth microdilution method for susceptibility testing is also preferred for <em>M. marinum</em>, <em>M. kansasii</em>, and <em>M. avium</em> complex (MAC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM COMPLEX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditionally, <em>M. avium</em> complex was thought to include two species, <em>M. avium</em> and <em>Mycobacterium intracellulare</em>. Due to advances in molecular identification, MAC is actually composed of several different species including <em>M. avium</em>, <em>M. intracellulare</em>, <em>Mycobacterium indicus pranii</em>, <em>Mycobacterium chimaera</em>, <em>Mycobacterium arosiense</em>, <em>Mycobacterium vulneris</em>, <em>Mycobacterium bouchedurhonense</em>, <em>Mycobacterium colombiense</em>, <em>Mycobacterium marseillense</em>, <em>Mycobacterium yongonense</em>, and <em>Mycobacterium timonense </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]<em>.</em> <em>M. avium</em> and <em>M. intracellulare</em> are also separate species; distinguishing between them has been of uncertain clinical value for individual patients, but there is a growing consensus that this distinction is both meaningful and necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Nevertheless, most commercial labs do not identify the species within the complex.</p><p><em>Mycobacterium scrofulaceum</em> was once grouped with these organisms as the &quot;MAIS complex&quot; (<em>M. avium-intracellulare-scrofulaceum</em>) but this antedated modern diagnostic methods which readily separate <em>M. scrofulaceum</em>.</p><p>MAC are slowly growing organisms that are readily detected by acid fast smear and culture techniques. The organisms grow well in standard media such as BACTEC 12B broth and on Middlebrook 7H10 and 7H11 agar. In broth, the organisms do not show clustering or &quot;cording,&quot; and, on agar, MAC typically produces small, flat, translucent, smooth colonies that occasionally exhibit a pale yellow color. These colony morphologies differ from <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, which typically shows cording in broth and appears as rough, buff colored colonies on agar.</p><p>Highly accurate nucleic acid probes (Accuprobe, GenProbe, Inc) are commercially available that can identify MAC isolates within one day after recognizable growth is evident, a technique currently used by most reference laboratories. These organisms can also be rapidly identified by their mycolic acid patterns from the same samples by HPLC, although the capital investment required limits this methodology to high volume laboratories.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Susceptibility testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Susceptibility testing of MAC is difficult and controversial compared with <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. The single critical concentrations of drugs used for the testing of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> were initially chosen to separate treated from untreated strains and provided reasonable predictive values of clinical susceptibility and resistance for tuberculosis. These same values have not been useful for MAC, since almost all isolates are resistant to these single concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Despite these in vitro results, combination drug therapy is often clinically and microbiologically successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The two exceptions to this finding are macrolides and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>, for which the MICs have been shown to correlate clinically with in vivo response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. With the broth microdilution method, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> susceptible MAC isolates have an MIC &le;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. Similarly, MAC isolates with acquired mutational resistance to amikacin, which is associated with an MIC &gt;64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> do not respond favorably to amikacin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Because this represents acquired mutational resistance, similar to the mechanism of acquired macrolide resistance, it is necessary for clinicians to ensure that there are adequate companion medications in the treatment regimen to prevent the emergence of amikacin resistant organisms.</p><p>Routine in vitro susceptibility testing of MAC is not performed by most laboratories. An exception is testing for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> resistance, which can be detected by a mutation in the 23S ribosomal macrolide binding site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS) and the 2007 American Thoracic Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(ATS)/Infectious</span> Diseases Society of America (IDSA) statement recommendations suggest that macrolide susceptibility testing should be performed for all clinically important MAC isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Susceptibility testing against other agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifabutin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifabutin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clofazimine-united-states-available-via-national-hansens-disease-program-and-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clofazimine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, is not recommended since in vitro results have no correlation with clinical (in vivo) response. It may be reasonable to test newer quinolones and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> especially with macrolide-resistant MAC isolates (CLSI).</p><p>Additional efforts have focused on the potential usefulness of specific MIC determinations as a tool to guide drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Unfortunately, this technique has yet to be assessed in a comparative clinical trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MYCOBACTERIUM KANSASII</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike other NTM, <em>M. kansasii</em> has never been found in soil or natural water supplies, but has been recovered consistently from tap water in cities where <em>M. kansasii</em> is endemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. <em>M. kansasii</em> is seen on smear and recovered in culture by techniques designed for <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. It grows readily in the BACTEC broth, as well as on Middlebrook 7H10 agar and Lowenstein-Jensen agar. The organism typically produces rough large colonies that turn bright yellow with exposure to light (photochromogen). A species-specific nucleic acid probe for the identification of <em>M. kansasii</em> is commercially available (Accuprobe, GenProbe, Inc); this assay can be used once growth has occurred in culture.</p><p><em>M. kansasii</em> is readily identified by biochemical tests and by HPLC. On acid fast smears, <em>M. kansasii</em> typically appears as a large, long bacillus which has unusual beading when stained with Ziehl-Neelsen or Kinyoun stains. This finding suggests <em>M. kansasii</em> rather than <em>M. tuberculosis</em>.</p><p>Acceptable susceptibility testing methods include agar proportion and broth micro dilution. Traditional proportion method susceptibilities of <em>M. kansasii</em>, using the single critical concentrations for <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, are most useful for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethambutol</a>.

Thus, resistance to either isoniazid or streptomycin at these concentrations should be ignored and should play no role in decision making about therapy. Almost all isolates are susceptible to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> of isoniazid or 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> of streptomycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The 2007 <span class=\"nowrap\">ATS/IDSA</span> statement on the diagnosis and treatment of NTM recommends testing of <em>M. kansasii</em> isolates only for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> susceptibility initially, with susceptibility to other drugs tested only if the isolate is resistant to rifampin at 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. <em>M. kansasii</em> are resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a> at all test concentrations in vitro, as are all species of the nontuberculous mycobacteria.

Additionally, a proposal has been made to the CLSI to report clarithromycin MICs of <em>M. kansasii</em> because clarithromycin-containing regimens are often useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RAPIDLY GROWING MYCOBACTERIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) include numerous species, but the main clinically relevant species are <em>M. fortuitum</em>, <em>M. chelonae</em>, and <em>M. abscessus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. They are generally considered to be environmental saprophytes which are widely distributed in nature; they have been isolated from soil, dust, natural surface and municipal water, wild and domestic animals, and fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/5,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21</a>]. The organisms grow readily on Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11 agar and BACTEC 12B broth, as well as routine bacteriologic media such as 5 percent sheep blood agar or chocolate agar, within seven days. Temperature requirements may also be important since some strains of <em>M. chelonae</em> grow optimally at 30&ordm;C rather than 35 to 37&ordm;C.</p><p><em>M. fortuitum</em> is the most common of the RGM encountered in clinical practice or in the clinical microbiology laboratory. The laboratory impression is that these organisms do not always stain well with the Ziehl-Neelsen or Kinyoun method and may not be recognized readily with the fluorochrome method. RGM are also highly susceptible to the NaOH decontamination procedures which are used to remove other bacteria from specimens. Thus, quantitation of the amount of RGM organisms present by smear or culture can be difficult and should be assessed carefully.</p><p>Separation of <em>M. fortuitum</em> from <em>M. chelonae</em> and <em>M. abscessus</em> can be accomplished in the laboratory if at least two tests (usually iron uptake and nitrate reduction) are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Separation of <em>M. chelonae</em> and <em>M. abscessus</em> cannot reliably be accomplished with HPLC or commercial DNA probes, but can be accomplished biochemically (utilization of citrate), by drug susceptibility patterns and by polymerase chain reaction-restriction length polymorphism analysis (PRA). The clinical source of the mycobacterial isolate can be an important clue to the identification of the organism.

If an <em>M. abscessus</em> or <em>M. fortuitum</em> isolate is exposed to a macrolide, the erm gene activity is induced with subsequent in vivo macrolide resistance that may not have been reflected by the initial in vitro MIC of the organism for the macrolide. Therefore, the organism may appear to be susceptible in vitro to the macrolide but will not respond to the macrolide in vivo. Detection of this in vivo macrolide resistance requires incubation of an NTM isolate with macrolide prior to determining an MIC for the macrolide. </p><p>This appears to be one mechanism for the discrepancy between in vitro susceptibility results and in vivo responses for <em>M. abscessus</em>. Certain <em>M. abscessus</em> isolates, moreover, may also have a mutation inactivating the erm gene, resulting in retention of in vitro and in vivo macrolide susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, both molecular identification of the erm gene as well as phenotypic analysis of macrolide susceptibility are necessary.</p><p>The recommended susceptibility testing method for RGM is the broth microdilution technique with MIC determinations and resistance breakpoints similar to those used for other bacterial species.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">INFREQUENT OR DIFFICULT TO CULTURE NTM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of infrequently encountered species have been recently described or have become clinically more important. These include <em>M. xenopi</em>, <em>M. simiae</em>, <em>M. malmoense</em>, <em>M. genavense</em>, <em>Mycobacterium haemophilum</em>, and <em>Mycobacterium smegmatis</em>. Susceptibility testing is generally performed on these species, but what drugs to test and how useful they are is just beginning to be understood. Some species require special conditions for growth, such as <em>M. haemophilum</em> (iron or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> supplementation, 30&ordm;C incubation) and <em>M. genavense</em> (BACTEC 12B or 13A broth with six weeks incubation). The recommended susceptibility methods for <em>M. marinum</em> include agar proportion, and microdilution broth MIC at 30&ordm;C. However, Routine MICs are not recommended because all untreated strains have the same susceptibility pattern. Drug testing is necessary only in special circumstances such as therapy failure (CLSI).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H216947832\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the availability of 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and polymerase chain reaction-restriction length polymorphism analysis (PRA), the number of new species of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) has risen dramatically with the naming of species, such as <em>Mycobacterium genavense</em>, <em>Mycobacterium interjectum</em>, <em>Mycobacterium triplex</em>, <em>Mycobacterium celatum</em>, and <em>Mycobacterium lentiflavum</em>. Approximately 160 species have been recognized in the genus <em>Mycobacterium</em>. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within the genus <em>Mycobacterium</em>, four groups of human pathogens can be delineated on the basis of microbiologic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61936\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61936 \">table 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> complex</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Mycobacterium leprae</em></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Slowly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rapidly growing mycobacteria (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common nontuberculous species causing human disease in the United States are the slowly growing species of the <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex (MAC) and <em>Mycobacterium kansasii</em> and the rapidly growing species <em>Mycobacterium abscessus</em>. Less common human pathogens include the slowly growing species <em>Mycobacterium marinum</em>, <em>Mycobacterium xenopi</em>, <em>Mycobacterium simiae</em>, <em>Mycobacterium malmoense</em>, and <em>Mycobacterium ulcerans</em>, and the rapidly growing species <em>Mycobacterium massiliense</em>, <em>Mycobacterium fortuitum</em>, and <em>Mycobacterium chelonae</em>. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microscopic examination after staining and culture using specific media are the cornerstones of the identification of mycobacteria. All mycobacteria share the characteristic of &quot;acid-fastness,&quot; ie, after staining with carbol-fuchsin or auramine-rhodamine, they do not decolorize with acidified alcohol. Confirmation of the presence or absence of mycobacteria in clinical specimens has traditionally required culture, because of the relative insensitivity of direct microscopy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Microscopy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Culture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Highly accurate nucleic acid probes are commercially available that can identify MAC isolates within one day after recognizable growth is evident, a technique currently used by most reference laboratories. A similar nucleic acid probe is also available for the identification of <em>M. kansasii</em>. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Mycobacterium avium complex'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Mycobacterium kansasii'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine in vitro susceptibility testing of MAC is not performed by most laboratories. An exception is testing for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> resistance, which can be detected by a mutation in the 23S ribosomal macrolide binding site. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS) and the 2007 American Thoracic Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(ATS)/Infectious</span> Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Statement recommendations suggest that macrolide susceptibility testing should be performed for all clinically important MAC isolates.
