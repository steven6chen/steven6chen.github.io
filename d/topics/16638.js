Achieving an optimal outcome in patients with severe extremity injuries requires a multidisciplinary approach with oversight by the general or trauma surgeon and commitment from other specialists including orthopedic, vascular, and plastic surgeons and rehabilitation specialists. In most instances, a course of limb salvage can be attempted even if the patient has a mangled extremity; however, occasionally, the injury to the extremity is so severe that primary amputation at the initial operation is required to save the patient's life. Complications of surgical treatment for severe extremity injury are common; early recognition and treatment are important to minimize morbidity and mortality. </p><p>The surgical management of severe extremity injuries will be reviewed here. The initial management of severe extremity injury is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909592418\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTREMITY EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extremity evaluation is structured around the four functional components of the extremity (nerves, vessels, bones, soft tissues). Injury to three of these four elements constitutes a &quot;mangled extremity.&quot; The evaluation and radiologic evaluation of the severely injured extremity is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient#H122605471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation and management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient#H122605572\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;, section on 'Extremity evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909587619\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTREMITY ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knowledge of extremity anatomy and functional physiology is important for proper preoperative and postoperative extremity assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909587626\"><span class=\"h2\">Lower extremity anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bony structures of the lower extremity include the femur, tibia, and fibula. The musculature is contained within defined compartments including the anterior, posterior, and medial compartments of the thigh (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56894\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56894 \">figure 1</a>) and the anterior, lateral, posterior, and deep posterior compartments of the leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>The nerves of the lower extremity are derived from the lumbar plexus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76701\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76701 \">figure 3</a>) and include the sciatic, femoral, saphenous, tibial, and peroneal (fibular) nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72523\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72523 \">figure 4</a>). The femoral nerve (L2 through L4) is lateral to the common femoral artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66562\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66562 \">figure 5</a>). The femoral nerve provides motor branches to hip and knee extensors and sensation to the anterior thigh, femur, knee joint, and medial leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50419\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419 \">figure 6</a>). The saphenous nerve is the extension of the femoral nerve and is purely sensory.</p><p>The sciatic nerve (L4 through S3) runs posteriorly down the thigh, continuing below the knee after dividing into the tibial and common fibular nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77473\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77473 \">figure 7</a>). It supplies the hip flexors, motor function of the lower leg, and nearly all the sensory function of the lower extremity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50419\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419 \">figure 6</a>). The superficial and deep peroneal (fibular) nerves are derived from the common fibular nerve. The deep peroneal (fibular) nerve passes distally with the anterior tibial artery while the tibial nerve accompanies the posterior tibial artery.</p><p>The lower extremity is perfused by the common femoral artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51298 \">figure 8</a>). The common femoral artery branches into the superficial and deep femoral vessels. The superficial femoral artery runs anteriorly down the thigh between the adductor and quadriceps muscles within the anterior compartment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72956 \">figure 9</a>). In the distal third of the femur, the superficial femoral artery is in close proximity to the femur. The superficial femoral artery passes through the adductor canal to become the popliteal artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77245\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77245 \">picture 1</a>), which divides at the level of the tibial tuberosity into the anterior tibial artery and tibioperoneal trunk, which further divides into the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54800%7EEM%2F65590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54800 graphicRef65590 \">picture 2A-B</a>). The anterior tibial artery accompanies the deep peroneal (fibular) nerve along the posterior margin of the tibia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629 \">figure 2</a>). The peroneal artery passes adjacent the medial margin of the fibula throughout its course distally. The posterior tibial artery is accompanied by the tibial nerve within the deep posterior compartment. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909587633\"><span class=\"h3\">Collateral circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The collateral circulation in the lower extremity is derived from the deep femoral artery (profunda femoris) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72956 \">figure 9</a>). Collaterals are poorly developed in younger patients who tend to develop severe acute ischemia with arterial disruption. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909587640\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper extremity anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bones of the upper extremity include the humerus, radius, and ulna. The musculature is contained within defined anterior and posterior compartments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59437\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59437 \">figure 10</a>). </p><p>The brachial plexus is formed by the ventral rami of the lower cervical and upper thoracic nerve roots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50576%7ESURG%2F70189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50576 graphicRef70189 \">figure 11A-B</a>). It supplies cutaneous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53006 \">figure 12</a>) and muscular innervation to the upper extremity. The cords of the brachial plexus contribute to each of the five major nerves of the upper extremity (axillary, musculocutaneous, radial, median, and ulnar). The axillary nerve is purely sensory. The radial nerve is vulnerable to injury with humeral fracture since it winds around the humerus between the medial and lateral heads of the triceps. </p><p>The upper extremity is perfused by the axillary artery, which is a continuation of the subclavian artery. Near the head of the humerus, the axillary artery gives off the circumflex humeral artery and continues as the brachial artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71903\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71903 \">figure 13</a>). The brachial artery passes between the biceps and triceps muscles accompanied by the ulnar and median nerves adjacent to the humerus. The ulnar nerve deviates to pass around the lateral condyle while the brachial artery and median nerve pass to the antecubital fossa, where the artery divides into the radial, interosseus, and ulnar arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540 \">figure 14</a>). Distally at the wrist, the ulnar artery and nerve and the radial nerve are closely apposed to the ulna and radius, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69097\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69097 \">figure 15</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909587647\"><span class=\"h3\">Collateral circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The collateral circulation in the upper extremity is robust around the shoulder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66933 \">figure 16</a>) and elbow, and the upper extremity is generally more tolerant of acute focal arterial occlusion compared with the lower extremity. Multiple injuries or involvement of the collateral vessels lower the level of tolerance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909592820\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMB SALVAGE VERSUS AMPUTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A decision to salvage a limb versus amputation is always difficult. A management algorithm from the Western Trauma Association illustrates the complexity of this decision in patients with severe extremity trauma as well as the lack of high-quality evidence to guide this critical decision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F95992\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef95992 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Primary amputation may need to be considered in patients who have no options for limb salvage that would lead to meaningful functional recovery of the limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, based on our experience with combat injuries, there are very few absolute indications for primary amputation.</p><p>If limb salvage can be accomplished at the index operation without threatening the patient's life, we suggest making the effort even if the patient has multiple risk factors for limb loss. This strategy allows time for the patient and family to accept amputation if it becomes necessary. Provided there is some chance for functional recovery of the limb, initial limb salvage is cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Patients with a severely crushed extremity, or patients with traumatic amputation or near-amputation who have destruction of the tissues distal to the injury, a mangled stump, excess intervening tissue loss, or in whom the amputated extremity is missing, should undergo a formalized amputation. </p><p>If there is a fracture in the same extremity proximal to the amputation, stabilizing the fracture preserves residual limb length, which, for the lower extremity, may improve the ability to ambulate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other generally accepted principles of open fracture management should be followed. (See <a href=\"#H909588578\" class=\"local\">'Fracture management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909588543\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of surgical management is limb salvage. Patients with life-threatening injuries should undergo a damage control approach, and a small number of patients with devastating injuries will require amputation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909588550\"><span class=\"h2\">Damage control surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When emergent surgery is indicated to control life-threatening bleeding in the abdomen or chest, extremity fractures should be quickly reduced and stabilized with splinting or in-line traction. Damage control torso surgery takes priority over extremity trauma as long as sites of extremity bleeding remain controlled. Tourniquets and dressings may need to remain in place on the extremity until life-threatening hemorrhage is controlled. </p><p>After life-threatening torso injuries are addressed, the extremity injury can be assessed. Priorities include definitive control of bleeding sites with vascular ligation or placement of a vascular shunt, debridement of devitalized or grossly contaminated tissue, and quick stabilization of any fractures, if possible. Following these measures, the soft tissue wound can be managed with temporary closure using gauze dressings or negative pressure wound dressings. Further plans are made for repeat evaluation once the patient has been stabilized in the intensive care unit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909588557\"><span class=\"h3\">Vascular ligation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, ligation (arterial or venous) is best tolerated with distal or minor vascular injury. There is some degree of redundancy of circulation in the forearm and leg. Specifically, the radial or ulnar artery of the forearm can often be ligated when the other is not damaged. Similarly, ligation of any one of the three vessels of the leg (anterior tibial, peroneal, posterior tibial) is a damage control option provided that either the anterior or posterior tibial vessel is patent to provide in-line flow to the foot.</p><p>Whenever possible, we prefer vascular shunting over arterial ligation as a damage control technique for managing injuries to more major arterial structures. Arterial ligation of major vessels should be undertaken with caution only after options for reconstruction have been carefully considered, since ligation risks the development of limb-threatening ischemia. If the vascular injury needs to be ligated, the patient should be closely monitored in the postoperative period for evidence of progressive ischemia that may indicate a need for revascularization or amputation depending upon the patient's other injuries and clinical status. </p><p>Similarly, ligation of major veins can cause venous hypertension. This can increase the rate of arterial graft failure in the acute setting and can also increase the incidence of long-term complications such as limb swelling and skin breakdown from venous stasis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909588564\"><span class=\"h3\">Vascular shunting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A less morbid damage control approach (compared with ligation) for patients with extremity vascular injury is vascular shunting, a technique that has been available for over 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A vascular shunt is a synthetic tube that is inserted into the vessel and secured proximally and distally. </p><p>The effectiveness of temporary vascular shunting in patients with severe extremity injury has been shown in studies of combat casualties and in high-volume civilian practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. In one retrospective review, the use of temporary intravascular shunts over a 10-year period in 786 patients was reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Shunts were placed in the context of damage control to allow for reconstruction of Gustilo IIIc fractures or limb replantation. In this series of patients at high risk for limb loss, the limb salvage rate was 82 percent.</p><p>Vascular shunts are typically used for larger, more proximal arteries and veins such as the femoral, popliteal, and brachial vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/6-8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,10,11</a>]. Prolonged disruption of flow proximally is associated with increased morbidity due to a greater burden of tissue ischemia compared with injury to more distal vessels. In the setting of shock, the time to the onset of neuromuscular ischemia may be shortened. Studies in a hypotensive animal model suggest that neuromuscular ischemia can occur in as little as one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this model, shunting expedited reperfusion and improved nerve and muscle recovery. Vascular shunting may also be more crucial for injuries in which collateral circulation has been disrupted, such as when associated soft tissue wounds are sizable. </p><p>Temporary vascular shunting is preferred in the presence of the following clinical circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Life-threatening non-extremity injuries </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamic instability, coagulopathy, acidosis, hypothermia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unstable skeleton</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major wound <span class=\"nowrap\">contamination/infection</span> or wound deficits that preclude soft tissue coverage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular injury requiring a repair more complicated than a primary repair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resource-limited environment </p><p/><p>Shunts can remain in place up to six hours, but definitive vascular reconstruction should be performed as soon as the patient is sufficiently stable to undergo the procedure. Systemic anticoagulation is not typically used to maintain shunt patency due to the potential for bleeding from other injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909588578\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a fracture is identified, it is reduced as much as possible and splinted. If an open fracture is suspected, the patient should be taken to the operating room to debride and stabilize the fracture (usually with external fixation) either after life-threatening injuries have been managed or concurrently while less emergent chest, abdominal, or head injuries are being addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The timing of definitive stabilization of fractures depends upon the nature and severity of the fracture and the presence of significant vascular or soft tissue injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110486\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110486 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909588585\"><span class=\"h3\">Debridement and stabilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the initial operation, devitalized tissue and foreign material are surgically debrided from the wound. The location and extent of any soft tissue injury and its communication with the skeletal injury are evaluated. Open fractures should then be graded using the Gustilo-Anderson grading system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient#H151204170\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;, section on 'Open fracture grading'</a>.)</p><p>The wound is then copiously irrigated with six to nine liters of normal saline. We use a low-pressure irrigation system because higher pressure (&ge;50 psi) has the potential to drive foreign debris and bacteria into the deeper tissues, disrupt intact tissues, and inhibit bone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. A multicenter trial aimed at clarifying the optimal approach to managing open fracture investigated the outcomes of castile soap compared with normal saline irrigation delivered by means of high (&gt;20 psi), low (5 to 10 psi), or very low irrigation pressure (1 to 2 psi) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients with traumatic fractures were randomly assigned to one of six groups (2551 randomized; 2447 included in final analysis). Primary endpoints included reoperation within 12 months of the index surgery for the promotion of wound or bone healing or treatment of a wound infection. Secondary endpoints included nonoperatively managed infection and wound or bone healing problems within 12 months of the index surgery. There were no significant differences for primary or secondary endpoints when comparing level of pressure. Reoperation occurred in 109 of 826 patients (13.2 percent) in the high-pressure group, 103 of 809 (12.7 percent) in the low-pressure group, and 111 of 812 (13.7 percent) in the very-low-pressure group. For type of irrigation, reoperation occurred in significantly more patients in the soap compared with saline group (14.8 versus 11.6 percent). We agree with the study authors' conclusion that very-low-pressure saline irrigation (performed with a bulb syringe) is an acceptable, low-cost strategy for the irrigation of open fractures. </p><p>The skeletal stabilization procedure of choice is external fixation, which can be performed in any surgical environment (including resource limited) with infrequent need for modification and few complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Initial internal fixation is preferred if extensive soft tissue destruction, associated vascular injury, or significant contamination of an open fracture wound are not present. (See <a href=\"#H909588592\" class=\"local\">'Definitive fracture fixation'</a> below.)</p><p>External fixation or splinting of the skeleton is used until the wound is clean enough to perform definitive internal stabilization. The soft tissue defect is evaluated every 24 to 96 hours in the operating room depending upon the appearance of the wound at the last assessment. </p><p>If a vascular injury is diagnosed in the setting of associated orthopedic injuries, the operative sequence may have bearing on the success of revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In general, achieving bony stabilization greatly facilitates the vascular reconstruction. External fixation is usually performed quickly; however, if any problems are foreseen, a vascular shunt can be placed prior to external fixation to limit warm ischemia time to the distal limb. (See <a href=\"#H909588564\" class=\"local\">'Vascular shunting'</a> above.)</p><p>Once the limb has been brought out to length and stabilized, vascular reconstruction can then proceed without fear of disrupting the anastomosis during subsequent bone manipulation. (See <a href=\"#H909588599\" class=\"local\">'Revascularization'</a> below.)</p><p>Some surgeons advocate placement of cement beads with impregnated antibiotic solution into the wound bed adjacent to the fracture. Although this approach delivers high concentrations of antibiotics locally, a randomized trial comparing systemic antibiotics alone to antibiotic beads alone showed no significant difference in infection rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of osteomyelitis following trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909588592\"><span class=\"h3\">Definitive fracture fixation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitive stabilization of complex open orthopedic injuries depends upon the degree of bone lost, the extent of soft tissue injury, and the nature and severity of associated injuries. Definitive fracture fixation is not performed until the patient is hemodynamically stable and other life-threatening injuries have been managed. Patients with isolated extremity injuries and patients with minimal associated non-extremity injuries can undergo definitive fracture stabilization without delay. </p><p>Early stabilization of fractures improves pain control, protects the surrounding soft tissues, and facilitates mobilization of the patient. If the patient is well resuscitated with a mild-to-moderate disease burden and has a low-grade open fracture, intramedullary (IM) nailing of long bone fractures is the preferred approach. </p><p>For patients who are initially managed with external fixation, conversion to IM nailing within 28 days of external fixation results in a lower incidence of infection (3.7 versus 22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Some clinicians prefer to allow fixation sites to heal during a &quot;safety interval&quot; by casting the patient prior to definitive IM nailing. Others employ this technique only when pin site infections have occurred but otherwise convert directly from external fixation to IM nailing once the patient is stable and soft tissue coverage of open fractures has been achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>A multicenter trial randomly assigned 1319 patients to reamed IM nailing versus unreamed IM nail stabilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Patients undergoing reamed IM nailing of closed fractures were significantly less likely to undergo reoperation (relative risk [RR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.96), less likely to undergo fasciotomy for intraoperative compartment syndrome (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-1.25), and less likely to experience fracture dynamization from a broken or bent screw (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.80). These benefits were not observed in the open fracture group. Several other small studies have suggested that reamed IM nailing is safe and beneficial in patients with low-grade open fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The adjunctive use of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) added to the fracture bed during definitive stabilization has been evaluated to improve bony union. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 trials found no significant difference in healing rates with BMP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

In one longitudinal study of patients with severe lower extremity trauma, 50 percent had persistent severe disability over the seven-year study period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Patient characteristics that are associated with poorer outcomes include older age, female gender, nonwhite race, lower education level, living in a poor household, current or previous smoking, and poor health status before the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Functional recovery depends greatly upon the social and economic resources available to the patient, which can be more of a factor than the severity of the initial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>].</p><p>Blunt extremity injuries are associated with a higher rate of amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>]. In a retrospective review of 62 patients with 93 blunt vascular injuries, the rate of amputation was 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. By contrast, a series of 204 patients, of which 86 percent were penetrating femoral arterial injuries, there were six (3 percent) acute amputations and one delayed amputation at nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In a review of 152 patients who presented with upper or lower extremity injuries requiring a vein interposition graft (91 percent blunt mechanism), secondary amputation during the index hospital stay was greater in the lower extremity than the upper extremity (13.3 versus 2.9 percent), and early graft occlusion was often followed by limb loss, particularly in the lower limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p>For below-knee arterial injuries, the number and location of affected vessels impact the likelihood of amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/76,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,78</a>]. In a registry review, 122 patients with below-the-knee arterial injuries were identified. Amputation was not associated with Injury Severity Score (ISS), sex, or age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. As above, compared with penetrating injury, patients with blunt arterial injury below the knee had higher amputation rates (26.8 versus 7.5 percent). Amputation rates were 50 percent in patients with three injured tibial vessels, 29 percent with two injured vessels, and 17.6 percent with one injured vessel. An injured anterior tibial artery was associated with a higher amputation rate when compared with either posterior tibial artery or peroneal artery injuries (6 of 17 patients; 35.3 percent and 3 of 34 patients; 8.8 percent, respectively). Similarly, in a review of 86 patients with vascular injury below the knee identified by computed tomographic (CT) angiography, amputation rates were 68.2 percent for three injured vessels, 16.0 percent for two injured vessels, and 0 percent for one injured vessel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Functional recovery is more likely with an isolated amputation. One review of 395 patients found that 20 percent of patients had multiple amputations, 22 percent had isolated upper extremity amputations, and 59 percent had isolated lower extremity amputations. Following amputation, 17 percent returned to military duty, the majority of whom had a single extremity amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. </p><p>Comparing outcomes for different levels of lower extremity amputation, a systematic review evaluated 3105 patients and found significantly lower physical component scores for progressively shorter residual limb lengths (below-knee, through-knee, and above-knee amputation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. A significantly greater proportion of patients with a below-knee (72 versus 55 percent) or through-knee amputation (78 versus 55 percent) were able to walk 500 meters compared with an above-knee amputation or bilateral amputations (72 and 78 versus 50 percent, respectively). However, patients with a through-knee amputation wore their prosthesis less and had significantly more pain (85 versus 58 percent) compared with those with an above-knee amputation.</p><p>There is no single risk factor that increases the likelihood of delayed amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], but the combination of complex pain symptoms and neurologic dysfunction appears to increase the risk, particularly if the initial injury was a severe hindfoot injury or distal tibial fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Of the remaining 82 patients, 10 (12 percent) underwent secondary amputation after a median follow-up of 22 months. Factors that were significantly different between the limb salvage group and the secondary amputation group were Gustilo-Anderson fracture grade, high-energy injury mechanism, mangled extremity severity score, AO fracture classification, vascular injury, and fasciotomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective comparison of 850 civilian and 115 military open tibia fractures found a higher overall injury severity and limb injury severity in combat casualties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. There were 45 amputations in the civilian group (5.3 percent) and 24 amputations in 21 military patients (18.3 percent). There was no difference in the civilian versus military amputation rate for Gustilo-Anderson grade I through IIIA fractures (1.2 versus 0 percent) or Gustilo-Anderson grade IIIB fractures (6.9 versus 10 percent). However, amputation rates were significantly higher in the military population (28.8 percent versus 69 percent). In both groups, limb ischemia was predictive of failed limb salvage, although many patients with ischemia on initial evaluation had successful limb salvage. In this study, follow-up was limited to the index hospital stay for the civilian group and up to 60 days in the military group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a detailed review of 104 distal combat-related lower extremity injuries, 20 percent were managed with vascular reconstruction and were compared with 80 percent managed without [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The overall amputation rate (primary and secondary) was not different (23 versus 19 percent) between revascularized and nonrevascularized patients.

Mortality is a reflection of the severity of extremity injury, overall injury severity, and the development of complications (eg, venous thromboembolism). Mortality correlates to the volume of blood lost as a result of the extremity injury, which can be significant with junctional vascular injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Isolated extremity injuries have lower rates of mortality. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909589969\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma to the extremities represents one of the most common injury patterns seen in emergency medical and surgical practice. About 400,000 extremity injuries were reported in 2010 to the National Trauma Data Bank, resulting in an estimated 3700 major civilian amputations annually. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient#H1315120070\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A brief extremity examination is performed during the initial trauma assessment but should be repeated in detail once life-threatening injuries have been addressed. Injury to three of the four functional elements (nerves, vessels, bones, soft tissues) constitutes a &quot;mangled extremity&quot; (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-mangled-extremity-severity-score-mess-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H909592418\" class=\"local\">'Extremity evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient#H122605471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation and management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient#H122605572\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;, section on 'Extremity evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage control techniques are used to manage the extremity injury in patients with concomitant life-threatening torso or head injuries. Damage control torso surgery takes priority over the extremity injury as long as sites of extremity bleeding remain controlled. Fractures are managed with traction, splinting, or external fixation; vascular injuries with shunting of larger injured vessels or ligation of smaller vessels; injured nerves are rapidly identified and tagged if time permits; and soft tissues are irrigated and debrided to remove gross contamination, foreign material, and devitalized soft tissues. (See <a href=\"#H909588550\" class=\"local\">'Damage control surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Achieving an optimal outcome in patients with severe extremity injuries requires a multidisciplinary approach with oversight by the general or trauma surgeon and commitment from other specialist surgeons. Definitive treatment includes internal fixation with intramedullary nailing of long bones; arterial and venous reconstruction with autologous vein interposition graft(s); decompression or repair of peripheral nerves; and immediate or interval coverage of soft tissues. (See <a href=\"#H909588578\" class=\"local\">'Fracture management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H909588599\" class=\"local\">'Revascularization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H909588620\" class=\"local\">'Nerve repair'</a> above and <a href=\"#H909588627\" class=\"local\">'Soft tissue debridement/coverage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The postoperative course for patients with lower extremity injury is highly variable depending on the nature and severity of extremity injury, associated injuries, and the patient's comorbidities. Patients should receive mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism as soon as is feasible given the high risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in this population. The risk of thromboembolic complications rises sharply if pharmacologic prophylaxis is delayed beyond three days. (See <a href=\"#H909590718\" class=\"local\">'VTE prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H909590753\" class=\"local\">'Venous thromboembolism'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients#H38\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;, section on 'High risk general and abdominal-pelvic surgery patients'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications from severe extremity injury are common and can be life- or limb-threatening, and, thus, early recognition and treatment are important to minimize morbidity and mortality. Complications include wound complications (wound breakdown, infection), venous thromboembolism, rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria (crush injury, ischemia-reperfusion, extremity compartment syndrome), and heterotopic ossification. The threshold for performing extremity fasciotomy is low in patients with severe extremity injury. (See <a href=\"#H909590739\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H909588613\" class=\"local\">'Extremity fasciotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In civilian studies, functional outcomes for severe extremity injuries are not significantly different in patients who have undergone limb salvage compared with amputation, although most patients prefer limb salvage initially. Long-term functionality is more dependent upon patient social factors than upon the severity of the injury. Mortality for civilian extremity injury ranges from 5 to 10 percent.
