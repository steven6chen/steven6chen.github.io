Approximately half of patients with alcohol use disorder experience alcohol withdrawal when they reduce or stop drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-withdrawal-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>Predictors for the development of withdrawal in patients with alcohol use disorder include consumption of more drinks per occasion and the presence of more alcohol-related problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-withdrawal-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>] and is likely to be related to greater physiologic dependence. Tools to assess for alcohol use disorder such as the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test &ndash; (Piccinelli) Consumption (AUDIT-PC) can be used to identify these risk factors in a standardized fashion; for example, one study showed that an AUDIT-PC score of four or more was 91 percent sensitive and 89.7 percent specific for the development of alcohol withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-withdrawal-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients who have not had any withdrawal symptoms more than 24 hours after cessation are unlikely to develop such symptoms.</p><p>Though alcohol withdrawal is usually mild, an estimated 20 percent of patients experience more advanced manifestations such as hallucinosis, seizures, and delirium tremens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-withdrawal-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Seizures and delirium tremens, which are sometimes grouped as &ldquo;severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome,&rdquo; are a frequent reason for both general inpatient and intensive care unit admissions; for example, alcohol withdrawal syndrome was found to account for more than 10 percent of intensive care unit admissions to a Detroit hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-withdrawal-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The onset and duration of withdrawal symptoms vary based on the severity of the syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75499\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75499 \">table 1</a>).

Patients often experience loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Physical signs include sinus tachycardia (heart rates may exceed 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min),</span> systolic hypertension, hyperactive reflexes, and tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-withdrawal-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. Symptoms of mild withdrawal resolve within one to two days. </p><p>Some patients with mild withdrawal will go on to develop additional manifestations of withdrawal, such as alcohol hallucinosis, withdrawal seizures, or withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens). The latter are sometimes considered together as &ldquo;severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome.&rdquo; Patients can have withdrawal seizures or hallucinosis without manifesting symptoms of mild withdrawal. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1496762173\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol hallucinosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol hallucinosis typically begins within 12 to 24 hours after the last drink and resolves in another 24 to 48 hours. The risk for alcohol hallucinosis may be related to genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-withdrawal-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased thiamine absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-withdrawal-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Alcoholic hallucinosis refers to hallucinations that are usually visual and commonly involve seeing insects or animals in the room; auditory and tactile phenomena may also occur. In contrast to withdrawal delirium, alcoholic hallucinosis is not associated with altered cognition such as disorientation, and vital signs are usually normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H753483017\"><span class=\"h2\">Withdrawal seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol withdrawal-related seizures occur within 6 to 48 hours after drinking either stops or is significantly reduced.

Risk factors may include concurrent withdrawal from benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotic drugs; other risk factors include relatively low potassium and platelet levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-withdrawal-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It has been observed that the risk of seizures increases as patients undergo repeated withdrawals, which has been described as the &ldquo;kindling effect.&rdquo; Genetic determinants are under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-withdrawal-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Seizures are typically generalized tonic-clonic convulsions, occurring singly or in clusters of two or three. In a study, 60 percent of patients with seizures related to alcohol cessation had multiple seizures, and in 85 percent of these patients, the recurrence took place within the first six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-withdrawal-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Patients with complex chronic conditions, such as insulin-dependent diabetes or hypertension on multiple medications, require at the very least management in a medically-managed detoxification program. Patients with unstable chronic conditions or acute conditions (such as pneumonia or pancreatitis) require additional medical monitoring in an inpatient hospital setting. ICU monitoring may be required (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73377 \">table 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Determine the likelihood of withdrawal from two or more substances.

In a patient with a history of recent heavy alcohol use, alcohol withdrawal is a leading diagnosis, but a broad differential is important both in cases when patients are not able to give a reliable history and in cases were comorbid medical conditions exacerbate the presentation of withdrawal. The differential should include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection, such as pneumonia, meningitis, encephalitis, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis &ndash; The presence of a fever should prompt the clinician to assume that an infection is present until proven otherwise. A history of focal symptoms such as a cough, sweats, rigors, or abdominal pain, a physical examination with signs of possible infection, such as abnormal breath sounds, and the presence of leukocytosis on a complete blood count are clues that an infection may be the cause of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms. When suspected, imaging, blood cultures, and other testing can help identify an infectious source. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of infection in the older adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute coronary syndrome &ndash; The patient&rsquo;s history and cardiac risk factors are clues to the presence of acute coronary syndrome. An electrocardiogram and testing for cardiac biomarkers are important initial testing when acute coronary syndrome is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-acute-management-of-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the acute management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary embolus &ndash; Pulmonary embolus is an important consideration in hospitalized or postoperative patients who develop unexplained tachycardia. History should probe for dyspnea, pleuritic pain, cough, or symptoms of a deep venous thrombosis. A physical exam should look for dyspnea, abnormal lung sounds, jugular venous distention, or limb swelling. Oxygen saturation and electrocardiogram testing should be performed; further testing is based on the pretest likelihood of pulmonary embolus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism &ndash; The history may give clues as to the likelihood of hyperthyroidism, rather than alcohol withdrawal; symptoms of hyperthyroidism will usually have a more prolonged time course than alcohol withdrawal (ie, weeks to months) and may be associated with other symptoms such as menstrual abnormalities or weight loss. The exam may show typical features of hyperthyroidism such as lid lag. A low thyroid-stimulating hormone level is diagnostic of hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> panic disorder &ndash; Anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> panic disorder can be difficult to distinguish from alcohol withdrawal in patients with a history of heavy alcohol use. Anxiety about withdrawal symptoms can intensify the presentation of alcohol withdrawal. The patient&rsquo;s history and course are the most helpful in distinguishing the conditions when they are not comorbid; in particular, panic attacks are of shorter duration than symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, typically lasting up to an hour rather than days, and gastrointestinal symptoms may be less dominant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intoxication &ndash; Intoxication with stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine, amphetamines, or synthetic cathinones (such as &ldquo;bath salts&rdquo;) can resemble aspects of alcohol withdrawal, including the agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, and in some cases, hallucinations. Physical examination of patients with stimulant intoxication may reveal mydriasis and stereotyped behaviors such as picking, which are less common in early alcohol withdrawal. The patient&rsquo;s substance use history and urine drug testing can distinguish the conditions, though notably many synthetic cathinones are not detectable in standard drug testing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdrawal from other sedating substances &ndash; Withdrawal from benzodiazepines, opioids, and other sedating substances may resemble mild alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepine withdrawal in particular can be virtually indistinguishable from alcohol withdrawal, although tachycardia and hypertension are typically more pronounced in the latter. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Opioid withdrawal may be associated with mild hypertension, tachycardia, tremor, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting, but on exam, patients have pronounced mydriasis, piloerection, and rhinorrhea, which are absent in alcohol withdrawal. Most patients with opioid withdrawal are also particularly troubled by muscle and abdominal cramps, which are less pronounced in alcohol withdrawal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-withdrawal-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid withdrawal: Clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medically supervised opioid withdrawal during treatment for addiction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To rule out withdrawal from another substance, the patient&rsquo;s history, urine drug testing, and sometimes adjunctive information such as a review of a state controlled substance database for benzodiazepine prescriptions, are essential. The clinician should be aware that the patient may have several different withdrawal syndromes concurrently, each necessitating a different treatment strategy. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272362826\"><span class=\"h3\">Alcohol withdrawal seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for an alcohol withdrawal seizure includes epilepsy and seizures provoked by conditions such as hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, medication, substance intoxication, or substance withdrawal (particularly benzodiazepines); following a patient&rsquo;s first seizure, a thorough evaluation including the patient&rsquo;s history, laboratory testing, and imaging are required to distinguish between possible etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61807\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61807 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F106961\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106961 \">table 5</a>). Subsequent seizures that follow the reduction or cessation of alcohol use, and do not have new features such as head trauma or fever, do not require the same degree of evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H566683598\"><span class=\"h3\">Alcohol hallucinosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visual hallucinations are present in a variety of conditions including retinal pathology, visual loss, psychiatric disease such as schizophrenia, and delirium. The visual hallucinations in alcohol withdrawal are usually (though not always) distinctive because they are associated with other signs and symptoms of withdrawal such as tremor, tachycardia, hypertension, and diaphoresis. In contrast to hallucinations associated with delirium (whether related to alcohol withdrawal or other medical conditions), the patient generally has normal attention and orientation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with visual hallucinations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2146467063\"><span class=\"h3\">Withdrawal delirium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to alcohol withdrawal-associated hallucinosis or seizures, withdrawal delirium always follows earlier manifestations of withdrawal. Thus, in many patients with withdrawal delirium, the etiology is quite clear. Notable exceptions are the postoperative setting, or following a period of intubation and sedation for a medical condition in the ICU; in these contexts, patients&rsquo; first evident symptom of withdrawal may be delirium. Here, a broader array of etiologies must be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period#H3085118\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and management of unhealthy alcohol use in the perioperative period&quot;, section on 'Alcohol withdrawal syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with withdrawal delirium may or may not have autonomic instability. Particularly when this autonomic instability is absent or minor, the differential diagnosis encompasses most causes of delirium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59893 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When autonomic instability accompanies withdrawal delirium, the differential is narrowed somewhat; considerations include sepsis, encephalitis, meningitis, hyperthermia, or drug induced processes such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, anticholinergic toxicity, or intoxication with certain stimulants or dissociative anesthetics. Drugs to consider include cocaine, methamphetamine, phencyclidine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, or synthetic cathinones.</p><p>Obtaining history from family <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> close contacts familiar with the patient&rsquo;s patterns of alcohol use is pivotal in establishing alcohol withdrawal as a likely cause, particularly if the patient presents with delirium and other features of withdrawal, such as seizures, were not witnessed; in many cases, comprehensive laboratory and drug testing with or without imaging will be needed to rule out other possible etiologies.
