The prevalence of nontraumatic SCI is unknown, but it is estimated that it is three to four times greater than traumatic SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. SCI produces a wide variety of changes in systemic physiology that can lead to a number of complications, which rival the neurologic deficits in their impact on function and quality of life.</p><p>Medical complications after SCI are both common and severe. In the Model Spinal Cord Injury Systems Database, rehospitalizations occurred in 55 percent of patients in the first year after SCI and continued at a stable rate of about 37 percent per year over the next 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Genitourinary and respiratory complications and pressure ulcers were the most common reasons for hospitalization. Increased patient age and severity of the spinal cord lesion also impacted on the risk of complications requiring hospitalization.</p><p>This topic reviews the management of common complications of chronic SCI, whether due to trauma or other conditions. Acute manifestations and complications of SCI are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFE EXPECTANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Life expectancy is reduced among survivors of spinal cord injury (SCI). Mortality rates are highest in the first year. For patients surviving at least one year after traumatic SCI, life expectancy is approximately 90 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. Higher neurologic level and severity of injury and older age at the time of SCI negatively impact survival.</p><p>The most common causes of death after traumatic SCI are diseases of the respiratory system followed by cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. In earlier decades (prior to 1972), urinary complications were the leading cause of death. The risk of suicide is also increased among patients with SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Uninhibited or exaggerated sympathetic responses to noxious stimuli below the level of the injury lead to diffuse vasoconstriction and hypertension. A compensatory parasympathetic response produces bradycardia and vasodilation above the level of the lesion, but this is not sufficient to reduce elevated blood pressure. SCI lesions lower than T6 do not produce this complication, because intact splanchnic innervation allows for compensatory dilatation of the splanchnic vascular bed.</p><p>The estimated frequency of this complication is quite variable, ranging from 20 to 70 percent of patients with SCI lesions above T6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Autonomic dysreflexia is unusual within the first month of SCI but usually appears within the first year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Typical stimuli include bladder distention, bowel impaction, pressure sores, bone fracture, or occult visceral disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Sexual activity can be a trigger. Autonomic dysreflexia can also complicate medical procedures, as well as labor and delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic disorders complicating pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Spinal cord injury'</a>.)</p><p>Common clinical manifestations are headache, diaphoresis, and increased blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Flushing, piloerection, blurred vision, nasal obstruction, anxiety, and nausea may also occur. Bradycardia is common; however, some patients have tachycardia instead. The severity of attacks ranges from asymptomatic hypertension to hypertensive crisis complicated by profound bradycardia and cardiac arrest or intracranial hemorrhage and seizures. The severity of the SCI influences both the frequency and severity of attacks.</p><p>Management of acute attacks includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measuring and monitoring blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately sitting the patient upright to orthostatically lower blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removal of tight-fitting garments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Searching for and correcting noxious inciting stimuli.

CAD risk factors, such as adverse lipid profile (low levels of high-density lipoproteins, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and abnormal glucose metabolism (impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and diabetes) are more prevalent in chronic SCI patients than the able-bodied population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Factors that contribute to the development of these disorders include decreased muscle mass, increased fat, and inactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Studies suggest that the prevalence of CAD is 3 to 10 times higher in SCI patients compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, a nation-wide cohort study in Taiwan found that SCI was associated with an increased risk of stroke (HR = 2.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>CAD mortality also appears to be higher among SCI patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One contributing factor may be that SCI lesions above the T5 level may lead to atypical presentations for cardiac ischemia; manifestations may include autonomic dysreflexia or changes in spasticity rather than typical chest pain.</p><p>Risk factor management and treatment for CAD are similar to that of able-bodied individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Exercise options for SCI patients include hand-crank ergometry, hand cycling, swimming, and functional electrical stimulation of muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Body weight-supported treadmill training has been reported to improve glucose regulation in incomplete SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, diminished sympathetic responses, reduced cardiac output, impaired ventilation, and decreased muscle mass lead to reduced exercise capacity in chronic SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Physiologic responses to exercise, including increased heart rate, increased cardiac contractility, and vasoregulation, are also impaired with higher-level SCI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The autonomic nervous system dysfunction that results from SCI disrupts normal cardiovascular homeostasis. With SCI above the T6 level, baseline blood pressure is usually reduced, and baseline heart rate may be as low as 50 to 60 beats per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18</a>]. This is generally not a clinical problem, but may contribute to hemodynamic instability and exercise intolerance.</p><p>Orthostatic hypotension due to peripheral vasodilatation is more common in the first several months of SCI and tends to dissipate with the development of muscle tone in the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, it may also occur in chronic SCI, especially with excessive bed rest and diminished fluid intake. Gradual position changes, compression stockings, and abdominal binders decrease venous pooling and may improve orthostatic tolerance. Occasionally, increased salt intake, alpha adrenergic agonists (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=midodrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midodrine</a>), or mineralocorticoid agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a>) may be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of orthostatic and postprandial hypotension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute cervical SCI is associated with a risk of cardiac arrhythmia due to excess vagal tone, as well as complicating hypoxia, hypotension, and fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Arrhythmias are much less frequent in chronic SCI. However, patients with complete cervical SCI appear to have an ongoing risk of cardiopulmonary arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical and high thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) affect respiratory muscles. The severity of ventilatory failure and requirement for assisted ventilation depends on the level and severity of the SCI. Lesser degrees of ventilatory failure may produce dyspnea and exercise intolerance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-physiologic-changes-following-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory physiologic changes following spinal cord injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury#H15671403\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory complications in the adult patient with chronic spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Respiratory insufficiency'</a>.)</p><p>Because of impaired cough and difficulty mobilizing lung secretions, patients after SCI are also at increased risk for pneumonia. Although the incidence of pneumonia is highest in the first year following SCI, these patients remain at increased risk over their lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Older patients are at higher risk than younger patients. Efforts to prevent pneumonia include chest physiotherapy and vaccination.

Prophylactic use of low-molecular-weight heparin is the treatment of choice for most patients with SCI. While there are no good clinical trial data to guide duration of treatment, we suggest that it should be continued in paralyzed patients for at least three months after SCI, after which the risk appears to approximate that of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Specific regimens are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">URINARY COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal cord injury (SCI) produces bladder dysfunction, often referred to as the neurogenic bladder. Other complications can result from this, including infections, vesicoureteral reflux, renal failure, and renal calculi.</p><p>Urologic evaluation with regular follow-up is recommended for all patients after SCI; even ambulatory patients with SCI may have bladder dysfunction that can lead to complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Complications such as vesicoureteral reflux, renal failure, and nephrolithiasis may not produce symptoms, and if untreated, can have serious consequences. The frequency and specific testing involved (serum creatinine, cystoscopy, urodynamic studies, renal ultrasound) are not well defined but depend in part on the nature of the patient's urologic problems and other risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCI disrupts the two major functions of the bladder, storage and emptying of urine. Bladder control is a complex activity requiring the coordinated function of the cerebral cortex, pontine and sacral micturition centers, and peripheral nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;, section on 'Autonomic fibers'</a>.) In SCI, the sensation for bladder fullness as well as motor control of bladder and sphincter function are impaired. Depending on the acuity, level, and completeness of the spinal cord lesion, a number of problems can result:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder or detrusor hyperactivity produces reflexive bladder emptying. Patients may be troubled by bladder spasms as well as urgency and frequency, often with incontinence. Over time, this can lead to decreased capacity of the bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sphincter hyperactivity can impair complete emptying of the bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, a combination of detrusor and sphincter hyperactivity, can lead to bladder contractions against a closed sphincter, leading to elevated bladder pressures and vesicoureteral reflux.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder flaccidity is produced in lower motor neuron injuries affecting the cauda equina or conus medullaris as well as with acute upper motor neuron injuries (spinal shock). This leads to chronic urinary retention with overflow incontinence and incomplete emptying.</p><p/><p>Most patients with incomplete SCI and all patients with complete SCI, regardless of the level of the lesion, require assistance with bladder function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although there are no clinical trials that guide the long-term management of bladder dysfunction in SCI, accumulated clinical experience has led to some management strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The efficacy of these approaches may be manifest by the declining incidence of urinary tract-related morbidity and mortality in SCI patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/4,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,21</a>].</p><p>The goal of a SCI bladder program is to preserve renal function while eliminating urine at regular and socially acceptable times, avoiding high bladder pressures, retention, incontinence, and infection. This should begin as early as possible after SCI, with removal of the indwelling Foley catheter.</p><p>Clean technique intermittent catheterization (CIC) has a lower infection rate compared with the use of indwelling catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. CIC is performed at regular intervals, usually every four hours. A bladder volume of less than 500 cc of urine is targeted in order to avoid bladder distention, excessive intravesicular pressure, and reflux, as well as to reduce the incidence of infections. The timing of CIC and the amount of fluid intake is adjusted to reach this goal. A fluid intake restriction of two liters a day is common for patients with SCI. If present, a sensation of fullness and attempt at voluntary voiding is encouraged prior to CIC, since some incompletely injured persons will regain normal voiding function.</p><p>Intermittent urinary incontinence is expected. Condom catheters (for men) and adult diapers are important short-term interventions. After ruling out an infection and adjusting the frequency of CIC and fluid intake, medications are considered. Urodynamic studies should be considered to assess physiology and guide pharmacologic intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticholinergic medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxybutynin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tolterodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tolterodine</a>) decrease bladder tone, suppress bladder contractions, and may reduce urinary frequency and incontinence. Tricyclic antidepressants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a> have the added side effect of increasing urethral resistance tone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha adrenergic medications (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> and phenylpropanolamine) can increase bladder storage in patients with pathologic relaxation of the sphincter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholinergic medications (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bethanechol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bethanechol</a>) may help complete bladder emptying in those with hypotonic bladders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha-blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prazosin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terazosin</a>) help sphincter relaxation, lowering bladder pressures during contraction. These can be prescribed for treatment of detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, but may aggravate hypotension.</p><p/><p>Most patients are managed with a combination of CIC and oral anticholinergic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>For patients unable to perform CIC and without available caregivers, a chronic indwelling catheter may be necessary.

The indwelling catheter is changed every month to minimize infections. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxybutynin</a> chloride (5 mg bid) can decrease catheter-induced bladder spasms. With indwelling catheters, there is an increased risk of prostatitis, epididymitis, and urethral stricture. Suprapubic tube placement can help minimize the risks of infection and stricture. A cystoscopy every two years is recommended to monitor for the increased incidence of bladder cancer and stone development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Studies of detrusor injections of botulinum toxin A in patients with detrusor hyperactivity suggest that this treatment is safe and highly effective in controlling symptoms and improving quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/29,31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31-34</a>].

Although heterotopic ossification is common after SCI, only 10 to 20 percent of patients have clinical symptoms, with decreased range of motion and inflammatory symptoms in the affected joints. The large joints below the level of injury are typically affected, most commonly the hip. The pathogenesis of this phenomenon is incompletely understood, but it is believed to originate from osteoprogenitor stem cells lying dormant within the affected soft tissues. With the proper stimulus (as with hip surgery, spinal cord injury, and stroke), these stem cells may differentiate into osteoblasts that form osteoid and eventually bone.

High levels of pain and lack of social support identify patients at high risk for depression and suicidality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>].</p><p>Depression and anxiety following SCI should be treated; it should not be assumed that symptoms are a &quot;normal&quot; reaction to the circumstances and do not require treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Recommended interventions include psychologic counseling, pharmacologic intervention, and peer support groups.

Consequences can include hyperthermia during exercise or high ambient heat and hypothermia in lower ambient heat. There can be a blunted fever or a hypothermic response to infection. Others have noted episodes of hyperthermia or hypothermia in the absence of infection or environmental temperature change in SCI patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONAL DEFICITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The level and completeness of the spinal cord injury (SCI) are the principal determinants of the needs, goals, and expectations in functional abilities. Age, general health, body habitus, concurrent injuries, spinal instrumentation, intelligence, and motivation also influence recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>].</p><p>Functional recovery after a SCI begins in the acute care setting as soon as the patient is medically stable with range-of-motion and resistive exercise, upright positioning, and transfer work. In the inpatient rehabilitation setting, physical and occupational therapists experienced in SCI rehabilitation develop individualized programs that emphasize strengthening, joint protection, and compensatory strategies, combined with creative use of assistive devices and equipment to maximize function. There are no studies that suggest one form of therapy is more effective than another; despite evolving technological advances, the simplest traditional approaches are often the best [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/156,157\" class=\"abstract_t\">156,157</a>].</p><p>The general expectations for functional recovery based on motor level are outlined in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73350\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73350 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Life expectancy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic dysreflexia can complicate SCI above T6. This is an exaggerated sympathetic response characterized by headache, diaphoresis, and increased blood pressure that occurs with noxious stimuli such as pain from bladder distension, constipation, or pressure sores. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Autonomic dysreflexia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SCI also have an increased incidence of CAD. Hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrhythmias can be problematic in the acute and subacute SCI and are less frequent problems in chronic SCI. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of ventilatory failure and requirement for assisted ventilation depends on the level and severity of the SCI. Lesser degrees of ventilatory failure may produce dyspnea and exercise intolerance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-physiologic-changes-following-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory physiologic changes following spinal cord injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury#H15671403\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory complications in the adult patient with chronic spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Respiratory insufficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase risk of pneumonia is highest in the first year following SCI, but patients remain at increased risk over their lifetime.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCI produces bladder dysfunction, often referred to as the neurogenic bladder. Other complications can result from this, including infections, vesicoureteral reflux, renal failure, and renal calculi. Clean intermittent catheterization, supplemented by medications as needed is the usual initial treatment. Some patients require a chronic indwelling catheter. Botulinum toxin and sacral nerve modulators are being investigated as alternative treatment options. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Urinary complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual dysfunction after SCI can include decreased libido, impotence, and infertility. Erectile dysfunction may respond to treatment with a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Sexual dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel dysfunction after SCI usually requires treatment with a bowel evacuation protocol and a multi-dimensional approach. A regular diet that includes adequate fiber is an important part of management. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoporosis affects bones below the level of the SCI and increases the risk of fracture. The role of bisphosphonates in this setting is under investigation. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Bone metabolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positioning and mobilization can help ameliorate contractures and pressure ulcers after SCI. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Pressure ulcers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spasticity is common after SCI and has positive as well as negative effects. Treatment is empiric and is aimed at minimizing pain while maximizing function. Options include oral medication, intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a>, botulinum toxin, and nerve blocks. Refractory spasticity may require surgery. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Spasticity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurogenic pain after SCI is often refractory but may respond to standard analgesic therapy, antiepileptic drug therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antidepressant therapy. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Pain syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression frequently complicates SCI; patients are at high risk for suicidality and should be monitored. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Psychiatric complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional neurologic deficits are determined by the level and completeness of the SCI and are ameliorated by appropriate rehabilitation interventions. If patients experience neurologic decline, neuroimaging is indicated to exclude syringomyelia, posttraumatic myelomalacic myelopathy, or other neurologic pathology.
