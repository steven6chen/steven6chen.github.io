Since topical anesthesia of the airway for bronchoscopy always includes the vocal cords, airway protective reflexes are depressed or absent after completion of the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H203532318\" class=\"local\">'Emergence and postoperative care'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients initially gargle 4% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> to produce topical anesthesia of the mouth and base of the tongue. This is followed by direct application of atomized 1 or 2% lidocaine by spraying structures in the oropharynx and laryngopharynx. Then the flexible bronchoscope is introduced. Additional 2% lidocaine is sprayed via the bronchoscope port onto the cords (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94913\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94913 \">picture 3</a>), down into the trachea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94915\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94915 \">picture 4</a>), and finally onto the carina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94916\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94916 \">picture 5</a>). If necessary, the lower airways may be anesthetized by injecting local anesthetic through the distal channel of the bronchoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67231\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67231 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79391 \">figure 2</a>). Total dose of lidocaine should not exceed 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. However, total dose calculation is challenging since much of the initial 4% lidocaine gargle is expectorated, and swallowed lidocaine is subject to the first-pass effect in the gastrointestinal tract. Typically, we use 50 mL of 4% lidocaine for gargling followed by 10 to 20 mL of 1 or 2% atomized lidocaine for delivery via the bronchoscope. Although this total volume greatly exceeds 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> nearly all the 4% lidocaine is expectorated, and much of the atomized lidocaine is swallowed.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prilocaine</a> is avoided for topical airway anesthesia. Although it has excellent penetration of the respiratory mucosa, it may cause methemoglobinemia, which is particularly undesirable in patients with respiratory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-bronchoscopy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Agent selection depends on the planned procedure and patient-specific factors and preferences. In general, medications with rapid onset and short duration of action are preferred to allow rapid titration of sedation and analgesia during the procedure, as well as a quick recovery.

It is particularly useful for suppressing airway reflexes if administered by infusion. Paradoxically, bolus dosing of remifentanil may stimulate a strong urge to cough or in extreme cases, bronchospasm, and bolus dosing is also more likely to cause apnea compared with infusion.

Other disadvantages include room pollution due to frequent removal of the bronchoscope, as well as high consumption of the selected volatile agent because of frequent suctioning and the high fresh gas flows necessary to compensate for leaks around the bronchoscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3517943024\"><span class=\"h4\">Total intravenous anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advantages of a TIVA technique during flexible bronchoscopy include the ability to administer anesthetic agents independent of ventilation, without waste of anesthetic agents or operating room pollution. Similar to TIVA use for other procedures, disadvantages include inability to monitor blood concentrations of intravenous anesthetic agents, greater risk of awareness, and higher cost. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence#H7869294\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Maintenance and emergence&quot;, section on 'Total intravenous anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>The sedative-hypnotic component of a TIVA technique for bronchoscopy is typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>. Dose is titrated to the minimum required to prevent awareness (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence#H4116923945\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Maintenance and emergence&quot;, section on 'Sedative-hypnotic agent: Propofol'</a>). Ideally, neuromonitoring of the processed or unprocessed electroencephalogram (EEG) is employed during TIVA, with alarms set to detect high EEG indices that indicate possible awareness, particularly if an NMBA is administered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Awareness with recall following general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Neuromonitoring'</a>.)</p><p>The opioid component of a TIVA technique for bronchoscopy is typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a>, administered as a loading dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg,</span> followed by a continuous infusion at 0.1 to 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute</span>. Dose is reduced in older patients and those with severe comorbidities. In young, healthy patients, an initial remifentanil infusion of 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute</span> is typical, with titration to a higher infusion dose as needed. Although bronchoscopy can be an intensely stimulating procedure, there is little discomfort following the procedure. Thus, titration of remifentanil is ideal for ablation of airway and hemodynamic responses to noxious stimuli, followed by a desirable rapid emergence at the end of the procedure.

Placement of an airway device has the advantage of expediting the procedure because the bronchoscopist can access the airway quickly via a bronchoscope adapter attached to the LMA or ETT, without needing to navigate from the mouth to the vocal cords. Adequate continuous ventilation is usually achieved by ventilating around the scope after its passage through the adapter, although frequent suctioning can cause a large leak. </p><p>Factors favoring selection of an LMA include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desire to avoid muscle relaxation </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need for inspection or biopsy of the glottis, upper airway, or adjacent structures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brief anticipated duration of procedure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low anticipated ventilator pressures</p><p/><p>Factors that favor the selection of an ETT include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High risk of aspiration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long anticipated duration of procedure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High anticipated ventilator pressures</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1738749547\"><span class=\"h4\">Laryngeal mask airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Passage of a flexible bronchoscope via an LMA requires local anesthesia of the vocal cords to avoid laryngospasm. This is typically accomplished with topical application of local anesthetic administered via the bronchoscope. Advantages of this approach include avoidance of muscle relaxation (ie, paralysis) and the ability to perform a complete inspection of the glottis and proximal trachea. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3194946635\"><span class=\"h4\">Endotracheal tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When an ETT is used, the size (ie, internal diameter [ID]) of the tube must be sufficiently large to accommodate the bronchoscope and allow effective ventilation. Although an 8.0 mm ID tube is selected for many flexible bronchoscopy cases, a larger ETT is occasionally necessary. For example, the Olympus endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope has an external diameter of 6.9 mm. When an 8.0 mm ID ETT is used, the remaining cross-sectional area after insertion of the EBUS scope is equivalent to that of a 4.0 mm ID ETT, which is too narrow to allow effective ventilation. Thus, an 8.5 or 9.0 mm ID ETT is selected if EBUS is planned. &#160;</p><p>If a small ETT is necessary (eg, a patient with glottic or tracheal stenosis), the anesthesiologist must ensure that the planned bronchoscope will fit through the selected ETT before induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Other options include using a smaller bronchoscope or using an LMA.

TIVA is the only anesthetic choice if JV is to be used because inhalation anesthetics cannot be administered via a JV system (see <a href=\"#H85662128\" class=\"local\">'Jet ventilation'</a> below). We typically administer an NMBA to induce complete muscle relaxation. This prevents patient movement and facilitates exposure of the glottis for the bronchoscopist.</p><p>Similar to a TIVA technique for flexible bronchoscopy, we typically administer a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a> (see <a href=\"#H3517943024\" class=\"local\">'Total intravenous anesthesia'</a> above), although alternative or additional agents may be selected, as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence#H7869294\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Maintenance and emergence&quot;, section on 'Total intravenous anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1201284957\"><span class=\"h3\">Inhalation anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the bronchoscopist's ability to secure the airway with the rigid bronchoscope is uncertain (eg, tracheal stenosis, presence of a foreign body), we select an inhalation anesthetic induction technique, typically with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, in order to maintain spontaneous ventilation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhalation-anesthetic-agents-clinical-effects-and-uses#H918523793\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhalation anesthetic agents: Clinical effects and uses&quot;, section on 'Induction of general anesthesia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction#H295889239\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;, section on 'Inhalation anesthetic induction'</a>). No NMBA is administered during spontaneous ventilation. Also, opioid administration is minimized during induction to avoid hypoventilation and apnea. This &ldquo;don&rsquo;t burn your bridges&rdquo; approach affords a margin of safety if the bronchoscopist is unable to rapidly secure the airway.</p><p>After induction of general anesthesia, before attempts at securing the airway, we usually switch to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a> as the volatile anesthetic agent, rather than continuing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> administration. Isoflurane is the most soluble potent volatile agent available in North America (or halothane may be used, if available). Thus, changes in anesthetic depth are less rapid when inhalation anesthetic administration is briefly interrupted (eg, when the rigid bronchoscope must be removed to perform airway interventions or during temporary periods of apnea). Anesthetic depth is more stable because a spontaneously breathing patient will not have apnea, and an apneic patient will not immediately awaken from general anesthesia produced with isoflurane or halothane. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence#H55659579\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Maintenance and emergence&quot;, section on 'Isoflurane'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhalation-anesthetic-agents-properties-and-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhalation anesthetic agents: Properties and delivery&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Once the airway has been secured by the bronchoscopist&rsquo;s interventions (eg, removal of a foreign body or treatment of tracheal stenosis), we typically discontinue the volatile anesthetic and switch to a TIVA technique; an NMBA is usually administered as part of the TIVA technique. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-tracheal-surgery#H976956216\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for tracheal surgery&quot;, section on 'Rigid bronchoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>Disadvantages of an inhalation technique include difficulty in providing adequate anesthetic depth that prevents coughing and movement during bronchoscopic instrumentation. Typically, a 1.5 to 2.0 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is necessary (with MAC defined as the concentration of an inhaled agent in the alveoli that is required to prevent movement in response to a surgical stimulus in 50 percent of patients). However, accurate measurements of the end-tidal anesthetic agent cannot be obtained because anesthetic gases leak around the bronchoscope. Another disadvantage of an inhalation technique is the pollution of the operating room with anesthetic gases that occurs with such leakage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1993057043\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilation techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Controlled ventilation during rigid bronchoscopy in the anesthetized patient may be accomplished with standard PPV or a JV system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3580467400\"><span class=\"h3\">Positive pressure ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PPV is accomplished by connecting an anesthesia circuit to the side connector of the rigid bronchoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53603\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53603 \">picture 6</a>). Ventilation is typically controlled by hand in order to accommodate the bronchoscopist&rsquo;s need for periods of apnea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation during anesthesia in adults&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>A disadvantage for this technique is the need for the bronchoscopist to completely cover the proximal end of the bronchoscope that is outside the body each time the anesthesiologist generates positive pressure with hand ventilation. This impairs the bronchoscopist's ability to work and necessitates frequent interruption of ventilation (ie, periods of apnea). Also, as noted above, there is significant leakage of gases around the bronchoscope. Although the bronchoscopist can place a throat pack in the oropharynx to ameliorate this, hypoventilation often occurs and measurements of end-tidal gases (eg, oxygen, carbon dioxide, inhalation anesthetic agents) may be inaccurate. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85662128\"><span class=\"h3\">Jet ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>JV is an alternative ventilation technique during rigid bronchoscopy suitable for patients having a patent airway with a diameter large enough to allow an adequate pathway for egress of ventilation gases. Use of a jet ventilator requires TIVA because inhaled anesthetics cannot be administered via a JV system. An NMBA is often administered to induce complete muscle relaxation. (See <a href=\"#H957143806\" class=\"local\">'Total intravenous anesthesia'</a> above.) </p><p>Typical settings for JV during rigid bronchoscopy are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory rate: 20 to 30 breaths per minute. Higher frequency JV is not usually required. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Driving pressure: 18 to 25 mmHg. The minimum driving pressure to achieve appropriate chest rise and adequate oxygenation varies; a large patient with a heavy chest wall will require higher driving pressure than a smaller patient. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspiratory time: 30 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fraction of inspired oxygen concentration (FiO<sub>2</sub>): Variable (as low as 0.3 during use of a surgical laser and up to 1.0 if hypoxemia is present).</p><p/><p>Many rigid bronchoscopes have a purpose-built port with a Luer-Lok connection for JV tubing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68008\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68008 \">picture 1</a>). This is desirable since it provides a secure location for attaching the jet ventilator tubing, preventing too much slippage in or out. However, it is possible to accomplish JV via a catheter inserted directly into a rigid bronchoscope (eg, an airway exchange catheter).</p><p>We use the only electronic JV system that is commercially available in the United States (the Monsoon III jet ventilator manufactured by Acutronic Medical Systems AG). This ventilator has sampling catheters that measure airway pressures within the JV catheter before the administration of each breath, as well as during inspiration (via a second sampling catheter). If either pressure exceeds the maximal setting, ventilation is immediately suspended by the device. Thus, build-up of high pressures that may cause a pneumothorax is prevented. </p><p>Although manual JV is employed in some centers, this technique requires extreme caution due to a high risk for barotrauma. The anesthesiologist must ensure that there is no airway obstruction and that an adequate pathway exists for egress of gas from the chest. Since high pressures may be delivered to the patient&rsquo;s lungs during manual JV, a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can develop rapidly, with resultant hemodynamic collapse <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> traumatic injury. Each one pound-force per square inch (psi) by jet ventilation is equivalent to 75 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, compared with standard hospital wall outlets for oxygen that are calibrated to 50 psi (equivalent to &gt;3500 cmH<sub>2</sub>O).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2743824827\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergence and postoperative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway management during emergence from general anesthesia after a rigid bronchoscopy procedure may be challenging. One option is to remove the rigid bronchoscope while the patient is still deeply anesthetized, with replacement with an endotracheal tube (ETT) or laryngeal mask airway (LMA), or use of a facemask for continued delivery of controlled or assisted ventilation until spontaneous breathing has resumed.</p><p>An alternative strategy is to hold the rigid bronchoscope firmly in place so that it does not exert undue pressure on soft airway tissues or teeth, while continuing either PPV or low frequency JV through the bronchoscope as the patient awakens. Once the patient becomes responsive, the rigid scope is removed as quickly and smoothly as possible. An infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a> &ge;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min</span> may be necessary to minimize struggling during bronchoscope removal that could result in airway injury. With this technique, extubation is decisively accomplished as soon as the patient can follow commands, typically prior to spontaneous respiratory efforts or recovery of airway reflexes.</p><p>Similar to emergence after flexible bronchoscopy, secretions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood are frequently suctioned after rigid bronchoscopy (see <a href=\"#H203532318\" class=\"local\">'Emergence and postoperative care'</a> above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1136982077\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy, either topical anesthesia of the airway combined with sedation or a general anesthetic may be acceptable.
