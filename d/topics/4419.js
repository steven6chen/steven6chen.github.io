They are caused by either autonomic imbalance or ischemia and necrosis of the conduction system. The most common clinical consequence is bradycardia, which may or may not be symptomatic. Complete heart block with a slow escape rhythm is a potentially fatal event in this setting if not detected and treated. In addition, it is important to recognize which bradyarrhythmias are transient and which are likely to progress to irreversible and symptomatic high-degree atrioventricular block.</p><p>The major conduction abnormalities associated with acute MI will be reviewed here. Supraventricular arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraventricular-arrhythmias-after-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND BLOOD SUPPLY OF THE CONDUCTION SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After leaving the atrioventricular (AV) node, the bundle of His divides at the juncture of the fibrous and muscular boundaries of the interventricular septum into the right and left bundle branches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63340\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63340 \">figure 1</a>). The right bundle branch courses down the right side of interventricular septum near the endocardium in its upper third, deeper in the muscular portion of the septum in the middle third, and then again near the endocardium in its lower third. The right bundle does not branch throughout most of its course, but it begins to ramify as it approaches the base of the right anterior papillary muscle with fascicles going to the septal and free wall of the right ventricle. The apical free wall at the base of the right anterior papillary muscle is the earliest site of right ventricular activation.</p><p>The left bundle branch penetrates the membranous portion of the interventricular septum under the aortic ring. Shortly thereafter, it divides into several discrete branches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An anterior fascicle that crosses the left ventricular outflow tract and terminates in the Purkinje system of the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A posterior fascicle that fans out extensively inferiorly and posteriorly.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In about 65 percent of hearts, a separate fascicle to the interventricular septum.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all patients there is early septal activation, either by a discrete septal branch or septal extensions of the posterior fascicle.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It should also be noted that fibers in the His bundle are predestined to form the left bundle branch.</p><p/><p>In order to fully understand the relationship between myocardial infarction and dysrhythmia, it is helpful to review the vascular supply of the different components of the conduction system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70956 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinoatrial node &ndash; Supplied by the right coronary artery (RCA) in 60 percent of patients; by the left circumflex artery (LCX) in 40 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrioventricular (AV) node &ndash; Supplied by the RCA in 90 percent (AV nodal branch); by the LCX in 10 percent of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>His bundle &ndash; Supplied by the RCA (AV nodal branch) with a minor contribution from the septal perforators of the left anterior descending artery (LAD).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Main or proximal left bundle branch &ndash; The LAD provides most of the blood supply for the left bundle branch, particularly for the initial portion.

For example, the incidence is lower in studies of patients who received reperfusion therapy compared with older studies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is frequently difficult to distinguish between electrocardiographic (ECG) conduction abnormalities that are chronic (pre-existing) and those that are new abnormalities associated with the infarction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different studies used different definitions of &ldquo;high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.&rdquo; Some studies limited analysis to patients with complete AV block, others to those with Mobitz II second-degree AV block and complete AV block, and others to all second- and third-degree AV block.</p><p/><p>The National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 2 (NRMI-2) in the United States evaluated the incidence of <strong>bundle branch block</strong> in 297,832 patients admitted to a hospital with an acute MI between 1994 and 1997: 6.7 percent of patients had a left bundle branch block (LBBB) and 6.2 percent had a right bundle branch block (RBBB) on the initial ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A similar rate of LBBB (9 percent) was noted in a prospective analysis of over 88,000 patients in Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Because both of these series only assessed the presence of BBB on the initial ECG, these data provide no information on the incidence of new conduction disease in acute MI. </p><p>The largest experience with <strong>high degree AV block</strong> in the fibrinolytic era comes from a review of almost 76,000 patients with ST-elevation MI (STEMI) enrolled in four large randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The overall incidence was 6.9 percent: 9.8 percent with inferior MI and 3.2 percent with anterior MI.</p><p>In the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) era, one study showed that high degree AV block occurred in 3.2 percent of patients, 5.9 percent of patients with right coronary artery occlusion, and in 1.5 percent of patients with other infarct-related arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. These generally occurred within the first two days. A similar incidence was found in another registry (2015) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Conduction disturbances based on infarct location'</a> below.)</p><p>The incidence of <strong>complete heart block</strong> (CHB) in acute MI in thrombolytic trials was about to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>], and the combined end point of CHB or second degree AV block was seen in 7 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17</a>]. The incidence of AV block appears to be declining in more recent primary PCI cohorts; in the HORIZONS-AMI trial, the combined incidence of Mobitz II and complete AV block was only 1.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anticoagulant-therapy-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction#H21647881\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anticoagulant therapy in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'UFH compared with bivalirudin'</a>.)</p><p>While there are fewer studies concerning AV block in acute MI since widespread use of PCI, the incidence of AV block appears to have declined. Among 2073 STEMI patients treated with primary PCI in the Danish National Patient Register, only 67 (3.2 percent) had documentation of second or third degree AV block at presentation or during hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Another study examined 6662 STEMI patients enrolled in a prospective registry in Brittany, France between 2006 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. About 74 percent of patients underwent primary PCI and 90 percent had PCI at some point in the index hospitalization. A total of 234 patient (3.5 percent) had Mobitz II or third degree AV block; 149 (2.2 percent) on admission and 85 (1.3 percent) later in the hospitalization. AV block was more common among those with right coronary occlusion (5.9 percent) than those with other infarct-related arteries (1.5 percent). Rates of AV block developing during hospitalization were lower for patients undergoing primary PCI (1.2 percent) or thrombolysis (0.5 percent) than those with no reperfusion treatment (2.6 percent). </p><p>Similar findings have been reported in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) registry enrolled 59,229 patients with acute coronary syndromes (37 percent with STEMI, 33 percent with non-ST elevation MI [NSTEMI]) at 126 hospitals in 14 countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Mobitz II or third degree AV block occurred in 2.9 percent of patients (5 percent of STEMI patients, 1.9 percent of NSTEMI patients). AV block occurred in 54 percent at presentation and in 46 percent later in the hospitalization. The right coronary artery was the culprit vessel in 64.7 percent of patients with AV block and 31.3 percent of patients without AV block (p&lt;0.001). Thirty-five percent of patients with AV block had a temporary pacemaker inserted and 5.9 percent received a permanent pacemaker. Temporal analysis showed a declining incidence of AV block between 1999 and 2007 (-0.2 percent per year, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>Most reports that have assessed the incidence and prognostic significance of high degree AV block after MI have not distinguished between STEMI and NSTEMI. One study from the SPRINT study group reported on 610 patients with a first NSTEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Second or third degree AV block developed in 45 patients (7 percent). Data also suggest that AV block is less common with NSTEMI than with STEMI. In the GRACE registry, Mobitz II or third degree AV block occurred in 5 percent of patients with STEMI and 1.9 percent of patients with NSTEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>New BBB complicating acute MI is rare (0.73 and 0.15 percent of patients developed RBBB and LBBB, respectively, in the first 60 minutes after presentation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Conduction disturbances can occur after a &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; MI, as occurs with a septal (alcohol) ablation procedure for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This issue is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Nonpharmacologic treatment of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction&quot;, section on 'Complete heart block'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDUCTION DISTURBANCES BASED ON INFARCT LOCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management and prognosis of patients with bradyarrhythmias or conduction abnormalities after a myocardial infarction (MI) depends in part upon the location of the infarct. Often the anatomic location of the infarct can be gleaned from the electrocardiogram. In other cases, echocardiography or coronary arteriography supplies this information. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and blood supply of the conduction system'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Management of AV block'</a> below.)</p><p>For example, the management and prognosis of high degree atrioventricular (AV) block differs depending on infarct location:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High (second or third) degree AV block associated with inferior wall MI is located <strong>proximal to</strong> the His bundle in 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22</a>]. For this reason, complete heart block often results in only a modest and usually transient bradycardia with junctional or escape rhythm rates above 40 beats per minute. It is not uncommon, however, for the junctional escape pacemaker rate to exceed 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. The QRS is usually narrow in this setting. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High degree AV block associated with anterior MI is more often located <strong>distal to</strong> the AV node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is usually symptomatic and has been associated with a high mortality rate due in large part to greater loss of functioning myocardium. The current mortality may be lower than in the pre-reperfusion era due to improvements in the management of congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock, but the risk remains substantial.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Inferior MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conduction disturbance in inferior MI may occur upon presentation or after hours or days. Sinus bradycardia, Mobitz type I (Wenckebach), and complete heart block (CHB) are commonly seen, since the sinoatrial (SA) node, AV node, and His bundle are primarily supplied by the right coronary artery (RCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and blood supply of the conduction system'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sinus bradycardia</strong> is the most common arrhythmia associated with inferior MI. It is present in up to 40 percent of patients in the first two hours, decreasing to 20 percent by the end of the first day. It is usually attributable to increased vagal tone in the first 24 hours after infarction. Transient sinus node dysfunction occurring later may be due to sinus node or atrial ischemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>First degree AV block</strong> (characterized by prolongation of the PR interval) can arise in the AV node, the bundle of His, or the bundle branches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-degree-atrioventricular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First degree atrioventricular block&quot;</a>.) First degree AV block at the level of the AV node is common after occlusion of the coronary artery (right or circumflex) which gives rise to the AV nodal artery. RCA occlusion can lead to first degree AV block via ischemia of the AV node, by enhanced acetylcholine release from the inferoposterior myocardium, or possibly by making the AV node hypersensitive to the action of acetylcholine. First degree AV block due to occlusion of the RCA with involvement of the AV node is usually transient, generally resolving in five to seven days and requiring no specific therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Occlusion of the left circumflex artery, which may present as an inferior MI on the electrocardiogram, may affect the AV node directly in the 10 percent of individuals in whom it supplies the AV node.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inferior MI is typically associated with the more benign <strong>second degree AV block </strong>of the Wenckebach type (Mobitz type 1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73051%7ECARD%2F62040\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73051 graphicRef62040 \">waveform 1A-B</a>); Mobitz type II block is uncommon in this setting, generally occurring with anterior MI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79539\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef79539 \">waveform 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mechanism is similar to that described above for first degree AV block. Mobitz type I block is usually transient, resolving in most cases within five days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-i-wenckebach-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type I (Wenckebach block)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somewhat more than one-half of cases of <strong>high degree AV block</strong> are present on admission and somewhat less than one-half develop later in the hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Complete AV block (CHB) with inferior MI generally results from an intranodal lesion. It is associated with a narrow QRS complex, and develops in a progressive fashion from first to second to third degree block. It often results in an asymptomatic bradycardia (40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min)</span> and is usually transient, resolving within five to seven days. In the substudy from the TRACE trial described above, the incidence of CHB was significantly higher among patients with an inferior MI than among those with an anterior MI (9.4 versus 2.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In the primary PCI era, one study showed that high degree AV block occurred in 5.9 percent of patients with right coronary artery occlusion and in 1.5 percent of patients with other infarct-related arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Another study from a large United States registry showed a rate of CHB of 3.8 percent of patients with inferior ST elevation MI (STEMI) and 0.9 percent of patients with anterior STEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sometimes, RCA occlusion produces persistent complete AV block. This latter finding suggests concurrent involvement of the left coronary system, resulting in poor collateral flow. In one large United States registry, 11.5 percent of patients in inferior STEMI received a permanent pacemaker prior to discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conduction disturbances occurring with anteroseptal MI are less frequent but more serious, and the degree of arrhythmic complications is usually directly related to the extent of infarction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>First degree AV block</strong> &ndash; Prolongation of the PR interval due to slowed AV nodal conduction does not occur in anterior MI, since the AV node is usually supplied by the right or circumflex coronary artery, as opposed to the left anterior descending coronary artery, which is the cause of anterior infarctions in most cases. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High (second or third) degree AV block</strong> &ndash; Second degree AV block with anterior MI is usually at the level of the AV node or below and is almost exclusively a Mobitz type II block. The clinical course may be unpredictable, with CHB developing with little warning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-ii\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type II&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>CHB with anterior MI generally occurs abruptly in the first 24 hours.

An important consideration in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is that a bradycardia, even if asymptomatic or transient, can cause decreased coronary blood flow and reduced myocardial perfusion. The most commonly used therapies for symptomatic bradycardia in the setting of acute MI are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> or temporary transcutaneous or right ventricular pacing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Atropine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bradyarrhythmias that occur early in the setting of an inferior MI (within the first 24 hours) may respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>, while those occurring later are often atropine resistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22</a>]. Treatment is not indicated in asymptomatic patients, but is useful if symptoms are present such as dizziness, syncope, or confusion from reduced cardiac output. Atropine is administered in 0.5 or 1 mg increments to a total of 3 mg. Caution should be used with administering atropine in the setting of active ischemia or in the setting of bundle branch block (BBB) or Mobitz Type 2 AV block because precipitation of ventricular fibrillation has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Refractory hypotension after correction of the bradycardia with atropine usually indicates volume depletion or concurrent right ventricular infarction.

It should be used with appropriate procedural sedation. Placement of transcutaneous pacing pads is also reasonable when observing a patient at risk for development of AV block while a decision regarding temporary transvenous pacing is being made. </p><p>The following point should be considered in deciding whether to place a temporary pacemaker:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with inferior infarction, CHB may be transient and hemodynamically tolerated.
