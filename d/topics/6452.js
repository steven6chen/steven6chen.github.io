Thus, even when adequately treated, many CKD patients will have anemia as defined above. This is because the treatment of anemia involves erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs); multiple studies have now shown that targeting a normal Hb with ESAs increases risks of adverse outcomes.

Patients may have anemia related to CKD but are also at risk for all the other causes of anemia that occur in the general population. The initial evaluation of anemia is generally the same for CKD patients as in the general population. The evaluation should include CBC, red blood cell (RBC) indices, reticulocyte count, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), percent transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin, serum folate and vitamin B12 levels, and testing for occult blood in stool.

We agree with the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines that the potential benefits of reducing blood transfusions and anemia-related symptoms should be balanced against the harm in individual patients (such as stroke, vascular access loss, and hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3038381427\"><span class=\"h3\">Route of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that, for CKD patients, an ESA, whether epoetin or darbepoetin, be administered subcutaneously. Studies have shown that the subcutaneous dose of epoetin required to achieve a target Hb is approximately 30 percent less than that required with intravenous administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Intravenous and subcutaneous administration of darbepoetin are of similar efficacy. For nondialysis CKD patients, subcutaneous administration is more convenient for the patient as it allows self-administration. The avoidance of intravenous administration also allows the better preservation of veins for future hemodialysis access.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial epoetin dose is approximately 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/week</span>. However, the use of lower doses would also be reasonable, particularly in patients with pretreatment Hb levels near 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.</p><p>In practice, most patients are dosed by unit dosing (eg, a vial), rather than on a strict <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg</span> basis. Thus, we initiate therapy in most patients beginning at 4000 or 10,000 units subcutaneously once weekly or 10,000 to 20,000 units subcutaneously every other week. Weekly or even less frequent dosing regimens have been shown to be effective and safe, although long-term studies are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>]. A meta-analysis including seven randomized trials demonstrated no difference in Hb when epoetin was administered every two to four weeks compared with more frequent (weekly) dosing intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Darbepoetin is typically initiated with doses of 60 to 200 mcg subcutaneously every two to four weeks. If necessary, subsequent adjustments are made in interval <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dose.</p><p>We suggest that the lowest effective ESA dose be used. Higher ESA doses (primarily epoetin doses greater than 10,000 units per week or equivalent darbepoetin doses) have been associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular events independent of Hb level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

We individualize therapy in some patients who may have improvements in quality of life at Hb &ge;11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and will be prepared to accept the possible risks associated with higher Hb targets. We do not target Hb concentration &gt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.</p><p>The optimal target Hb level for CKD patients is not well defined. Our recommendations for target Hb reflect both regulatory and fiscal policies in the US, as well as results of clinical studies. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) boxed warning on ESAs states that, for nondialysis CKD patients, one should consider ESA treatment only when the Hb level is &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and reduce or interrupt the ESA dose if the Hb level exceeds 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Among both dialysis and nondialysis CKD patients, multiple studies have shown that Hb targets &ge;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> are associated with adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>].</p><p>A number of randomized trials have compared Hb target levels for predialysis patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/25,26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26,29</a>]. The best data are from the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy (TREAT) trial, in which 4038 patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] between 20 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darbepoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darbepoetin alfa</a> to achieve a target Hb level of 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or to placebo, with darbepoetin administered if the Hb level was &lt;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The primary endpoints were the composite outcomes of death or a cardiovascular event (nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], heart failure, stroke, and hospitalization for myocardial ischemia) and death or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The mean achieved Hb level was 12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and 10.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in the darbepoetin and placebo groups, respectively.</p><p>At a median follow-up of 29 months, both groups had similar risks of death or a cardiovascular event or death or ESRD. However, there was an increased risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darbepoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darbepoetin alfa</a> (101 versus 53 patients with placebo; hazard ratio [HR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.38-2.68), while red cell transfusions were significantly more common in the placebo group (496 versus 297 patients). Fatigue was only modestly less common with darbepoetin. There was also an increased risk of death due to malignancy in the darbepoetin group, primarily in patients with a past history of malignancy.</p><p>It should be noted that, in the TREAT study and others comparing lower and higher Hb targets in patients with CKD, the mean age of study participants was typically in the 50- to 60-year range, and many patients had cardiovascular disease. Whether younger patients and those without other comorbid conditions are also at greater risk of complications when higher Hb levels are targeted remains to be studied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adverse effects associated with erythropoietin in predialysis patients are similar to those observed in hemodialysis patients.
