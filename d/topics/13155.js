The specific gene mutations involved and their mechanism of affecting beta globin production are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of the thalassemic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This imbalance in turn leads to impaired red blood cell (RBC) maturation and destruction of developing RBC precursors in the bone marrow, called ineffective erythropoiesis or intramedullary hemolysis; as well as hemolysis, with reduced RBC survival in the peripheral blood. The severe anemia can result in extramedullary hematopoiesis and increased iron absorption, which can lead to excess iron stores even in the absence of transfusions. </p><p>The variability in the severity of anemia is explained mostly by the severity of the globin imbalance, which depends on the specific mutation and whether one or both beta globin alleles are affected. Other modifying factors such as the co-inheritance of alpha thalassemia or hemoglobin E may also contribute.

The major determinant of disease severity is the specific beta globin mutation (ie, whether it results in partial or total loss of beta globin production) and the zygosity of the individual (ie, whether the individual inherits one or two beta thalassemic mutations). (See <a href=\"#H2504772024\" class=\"local\">'Unbalanced globin chain synthesis'</a> below.)</p><p>The other major variables that can affect disease severity also alter the alpha to beta globin ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the nature of the beta globin produced: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Concomitant alpha thalassemia</strong> &ndash; Alpha thalassemia is due to impaired production of alpha globin chains; there are four alpha globin chain genes (as opposed to two for beta globin). As expected from a disorder that reduces alpha globin production, co-inheritance of alpha thalassemia trait ameliorates the severity of beta thalassemia by partially normalizing the alpha to beta globin ratio without greatly affecting the amount of total hemoglobin.

The clinical phenotype is similar to beta thalassemia but less severe. Hemoglobin E is commonly seen in India and Southeast Asia.

Excess free alpha chains cannot be incorporated into hemoglobin; they may remain soluble or aggregate and precipitate. The resulting abnormalities in the developing and mature red blood cells (RBCs) lead to two major phenomena, both of which contribute to anemia: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ineffective erythropoiesis</strong> &ndash; Ineffective erythropoiesis refers to reduced production of RBCs in the bone marrow due to a combination of apoptotic cell death and hemolysis of developing RBC precursors. In beta thalassemia this is associated with extramedullary hematopoiesis (production of RBCs in other tissues besides the bone marrow, such as the liver and spleen). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemolysis</strong> &ndash; Hemolysis of mature RBCs in beta thalassemia is primarily extravascular, involving phagocytosis of abnormal RBCs in the reticuloendothelial system. </p><p/><p>Some RBCs in beta thalassemia are hypochromic and microcytic due to decreased overall hemoglobin production. In addition, other grossly abnormal RBC shapes can be seen on the peripheral blood smear, including target cells, teardrop cells (dacrocytes), fragmented forms (schistocytes), and burr cells (echinocytes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76666\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76666 \">picture 1</a>). These shape abnormalities are due to effects on the RBC membrane and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Nucleated RBCs are also common, especially following splenectomy.

The beta-like chain (also called &quot;non-alpha&quot; chain) used as an alpha globin partner undergoes a shift during development, from epsilon in the embryo to gamma in the fetus to beta in the adult. The shift is accomplished by alternative gene expression and splicing from the beta globin locus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65642 \">figure 1</a>). Throughout the process, the ratio of alpha to beta chain synthesis is tightly controlled, such that it does not deviate much from 1.00 &plusmn; 0.05. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure and function of normal hemoglobins&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Beta thalassemia is caused by mutations that impair beta globin chain production leading to an excess of alpha chains relative to beta chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The free alpha chains cannot form tetramers; they are unstable and can aggregate and precipitate adjacent to the RBC membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Precipitated alpha chains can form &quot;large, single inclusions&quot; in RBC precursors and circulating RBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>An increase in production of the beta-like gamma chain (responsible for forming fetal hemoglobin) and the delta chain (responsible for forming HbA2) usually occurs but is insufficient to restore the balance between alpha and beta-like chains or to prevent alpha chain accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The mechanisms of increased fetal hemoglobin production are discussed separately.

In contrast, in beta thalassemia, incorporation of these proteins frequently is disorderly and discontinuous, especially in areas of alpha chain aggregates and at earlier stages of erythroid development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>These cytoskeletal abnormalities are thought to be due in large part to oxidant injury, either of globin chains that bind to them or of the cytoskeletal or integral membrane proteins directly, as evidenced by loss of free thiols within globin chains and other membrane proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. Oxidation is a normal phenomenon in RBCs (hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin at a rate of about 0.5 to 3 percent per day); however, in normal RBCs the oxidized methemoglobin subsequently is reduced (restored to native hemoglobin) via cytochrome b5 reductase (formerly called methemoglobin reductase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In thalassemic RBCs, isolated alpha and beta chains are susceptible to oxidation to form hemichromes, some of which are irreversibly modified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. These iron containing hemichromes can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn can oxidize adjacent RBC membrane proteins and lipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. </p><p>Oxidant injury is in turn worsened by free iron, levels of which are in turn increased by the effects of oxidant injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3093801428\" class=\"local\">'Iron overload'</a> below).

Proteolysis of some cytoskeletal and membrane proteins may also occur, although this has not been studied directly. Beta thalassemic erythroid precursors containing apparent alpha globin chain precipitates also have reduced protein synthetic capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>These abnormalities in erythroid precursors lead to increased apoptosis in the bone marrow, while the abnormalities in the mature RBC lead to rigidity, increased membrane expression of phosphatidylserine (PS), and neoantigens, all in turn leading to increased hemolysis, especially in the reticuloendothelial system. (See <a href=\"#H392164461\" class=\"local\">'Ineffective erythropoiesis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4261086734\" class=\"local\">'Hemolysis'</a> below.)</p><p>Abnormal cytoskeletal proteins in beta thalassemia include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Band 3</strong> &ndash; Band 3 (also known as anion exchanger 1 [AE1]) is the major integral transmembrane protein. It is the principle anion exchanger in the RBC membrane; it also has a major structural role in membrane integrity. Isolated triton-extracted membrane cytoskeletons from individuals with beta thalassemia contain about twice as much band 3 protein as controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Band 4.1</strong> &ndash; Band 4.1 is a cytoskeletal protein that stabilizes spectrin-actin interactions.

There is conflicting information about the assembly of spectrin in thalassemic RBCs, although it appears that overall levels of spectrin and its binding partners (eg, ankyrin, actin) may be reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. </p><p/><p>The normal organization and assembly of these proteins are illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79183\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79183 \">figure 2</a>).

The finding of cellular dehydration is somewhat counterintuitive, but it explains the appearance of dense cells on the peripheral blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60097\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60097 \">figure 3</a>) and the high mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) observed on the complete blood count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Dehydration of thalassemic RBCs is thought to be due to excessive and inappropriate activation of the potassium-chloride (K-Cl) cotransport system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62852\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62852 \">figure 4</a>), both in bone marrow precursors and circulating reticulocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/35,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38</a>]. Excess transport of ions out of the RBC causes a corresponding loss of water by osmotic mechanisms.

The magnitude of ineffective erythropoiesis was initially underappreciated, until studies using radiolabeled iron were performed that demonstrated that in beta thalassemia major, intramedullary cell death affected as much as 60 to 75 percent of developing RBC precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Subsequently the extent of apoptosis and erythroid expansion (numbers of developing erythroblasts) were shown to be increased in parallel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Characteristic stages of ineffective erythropoiesis in beta thalassemia include expansion of erythroid progenitor cells and accelerated differentiation followed by maturation arrest and apoptosis at the polychromatophilic erythroblast state (two steps before the reticulocyte) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Erythroid expansion is driven by increased erythropoietin levels, although this may be blunted somewhat by inflammatory cytokines. GDF11, a cytokine in the transforming growth factor beta family, promotes the expansion of erythroid progenitor cells. Blockade of GDF11 in an animal model of thalassemia has been shown to correct several features of ineffective erythropoiesis including anemia, hemolysis, and iron overload.
