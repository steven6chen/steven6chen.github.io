It is caused by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, which causes progressive accumulation of &alpha;-D-galactosyl moieties, such as globotriaosylceramide (the glycolipid substrate for alpha-galactosidase A), within multiple cell types and tissues of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Numerous mutations have been found in the alpha-galactosidase A gene (<em>GLA</em> gene) on the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq22) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Clinical manifestations usually become evident by 10 years of age. Initial manifestations typically include neuropathy and characteristic skin lesions known as angiokeratomas. As patients age, cardiovascular and renal disease become increasingly prominent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. An overview of the clinical manifestations of Fabry disease and other related disorders is presented in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56567\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56567 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide within endothelial, perithelial, and smooth muscle cells of the vascular system, dorsal root ganglia, and cells of the autonomic nervous system, result in the neurologic manifestations of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These include a small-fiber peripheral neuropathy and an increased propensity for ischemic stroke in affected males and female heterozygotes.</p><p>This topic will review the neurologic manifestations of Fabry disease and their treatment.</p><p>Other clinical aspects of Fabry disease are presented elsewhere.

Alternatively, it may cause recurrent painful episodes triggered by stress, fever, heat, fatigue, joint pain, or exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The pain is sometimes misconstrued as &quot;growth pain.&quot; Although pain tends to diminish with age secondary to progressive nerve fiber loss, it may be of sufficient severity to lead to suicide attempts.</p><p>Patients have decreased cold and warm perception that first manifests in the feet associated with decreased epidermal nerve fiber density in the affected regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Electron microscopy of peripheral nerves reveals loss of unmyelinated and small myelinated nerve fibers and lamellar inclusions in the perineurium and the dorsal root ganglia likely consisting of glycosphingolipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Nerve conduction studies are consequently normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain relief</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of chronic neuropathic pain in patients with Fabry disease remains empiric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Preventive pain therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> appears to be beneficial.</p><p>One potential advantage of anticonvulsants is that compliance may be monitored and the risk of toxicity reduced by following serum levels. However, these levels do not have a direct correlation with neuropathic pain response.</p><p>Narcotic agents should be avoided if possible. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents should also be avoided, as these tend to be ineffective and may lead to renal toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Gabapentin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of the anticonvulsants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> is most often used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Advantages of gabapentin include low toxicity, a low incidence of drug interactions, and lack of liver metabolism. The nearly complete renal clearance is potentially concerning in patients with Fabry disease, who are at risk for kidney disease. Therefore, renal function should be assessed before beginning gabapentin treatment and the dose should be adjusted accordingly, as renal function affects serum levels and half-life.</p><p>In children less than 12 years old, the starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> is 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day divided into three doses. The dose may be slowly increased up to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily. For older children and adults the initial dose is typically 300 mg three times per day (900 mg total per day). The maximum total dose may be in the range of 1800 to 2400 mg per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Other anticonvulsants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of other anticonvulsants have been used for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Of the older drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> have been used most often [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, phenytoin is not commonly used for chronic treatment in children because of concerns about adverse cosmetic effects that include hirsutism, gingival hyperplasia and coarse facial features. In addition, chronic phenytoin treatment has been associated with the potential for cerebellar atrophy and peripheral neuropathy. Carbamazepine appears to be effective but causes induction of the P450 system in the liver, which can be a concern in patients on multiple drugs that are metabolized by the liver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Amitriptyline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amitriptyline</a>, at doses well below those used in the treatment of depression, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. At the lower doses used for neuropathic pain, serious side effects are uncommon. Nonetheless, an electrocardiogram should be obtained before and after beginning treatment since amitriptyline can cause adverse changes in cardiac conduction.</p><p>The recommended starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> in children is 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> at night. This can be slowly increased over two to four weeks up to 0.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> nightly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CEREBROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebral involvement in Fabry disease is due mainly to vasculopathy and a dilative arteriopathy in affected males and female carriers and may result in transient ischemic attack (TIA) and almost always ischemic stroke. There is evidence of a resting cerebrovascular hyperperfusion in males with Fabry disease, which may cause increased shear stress and vessel wall damage over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The manifestations of stroke in Fabry disease are no different from ischemic stroke due to other common etiologies, and any stroke-related clinical deficit might occur. White matter abnormalities, seen best on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI images, are asymptomatic or related to subtle neuropsychological deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-26</a>]. Cerebrovascular complications are rare in children, but increase through adult life.</p><p>In data from 2446 patients in the observational Fabry Registry, the following results were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke affected 138 patients (6 percent), including 86 of 1243 males (7 percent) and 52 of 1203 females (4 percent). Most strokes were ischemic (87 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median age at first stroke for males and females was 39 and 45.7 years, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proportion of patients with a first stroke prior to the diagnosis of Fabry disease in males and females was 50 and 38 percent, respectively. The proportion who experienced a stroke prior to renal or cardiac events for males and females was 71 and 77 percent.</p><p/><p>From these data, the risk of stroke in male subjects 35 to 45 years of age with the classic form of Fabry disease is approximately 10-fold higher compared with the general population of similar age. In addition, stroke often occurs before the renal or cardiac manifestations of Fabry disease.</p><p>In an earlier literature review, the average age of onset for cerebrovascular symptoms of Fabry disease was 34 years for hemizygotes (n = 43) and 40 years for heterozygotes (n = 10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The most frequent cerebrovascular manifestations in hemizygotes were hemiparesis, vertigo, dizziness, diplopia, dysarthria, nystagmus, nausea, vomiting, head pain, hemiataxia, and ataxia of gait. Heterozygotes were prone to memory loss, dizziness, ataxia, hemiparesis, loss of consciousness, and hemisensory symptoms. The most common angiographic and pathologic features were elongation, ectasia, and tortuosity involving the vertebral and basilar arteries.</p><p>The cerebrovascular disease burden, in particular the white matter lesion load, increases with age. In an MRI study, lesions were present in no male patient under age 26 compared with all patients over age 54 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Of the patients with white matter lesions, neurologic symptoms were present in 37.5 percent.</p><p>White matter lesions also appear over time in female carriers. The Fabry Outcome Survey found that cerebrovascular events occurred in a high proportion of female and male patients (27 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The mean age of cerebrovascular event onset was below 30 years in men and below 45 years in women. In a subsequent case series of patients with symptomatic Fabry disease, the frequency of marked white matter lesions was similar among male and female patients (4 of 13 versus 5 of 14 [31 versus 36 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The high burden of white matter lesions and cerebrovascular events in women with Fabry disease (an X-linked disorder) may be explained by the lack of cross-correction from enzyme-replete to enzyme-deficient cells in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The risk of stroke is, in part, related to the ratio of mutated to normal cells in the vascular system resulting from random X-inactivation occurring in early development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Stroke prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard ischemic stroke prevention measures are considered effective in secondary (and possibly primary) prevention for patients with Fabry disease, although this conclusion is based solely upon clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>These measures include the use of antiplatelet agents and, in particular, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>. In our clinical experience, stroke recurrence is frequent in patients with Fabry disease who are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. Therefore, for primary (in adult males with the classic form of the disease and a family history of stroke) and secondary stroke prevention, we suggest clopidogrel 75 mg once daily rather than aspirin. The combination drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-and-extended-release-dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin-extended-release dipyridamole</a> may be useful. Antihypertensive agents and statins are often used. These treatments are discussed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fabry-disease-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fabry disease: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following are summaries of the effects of enzyme replacement therapy on short-term neurologic complications in the phase <span class=\"nowrap\">II/III</span> clinical trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) trial involved 26 hemizygous males treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase alfa</a> (0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> infusion or placebo, which was administered every two weeks for 12 doses (24 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Active treatment significantly decreased plasma and urine Gb3 levels. The primary outcome measure, neuropathic pain assessed by questionnaire, was significantly improved with active treatment, but not placebo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the International Fabry Disease Study, 58 patients (including 2 females) were randomly assigned to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-beta-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase beta</a> or placebo administered every two weeks for 20 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The primary end point (fraction of patients free of microvascular endothelial deposits of Gb3 in the kidney), was realized in 69 and zero percent in the active and placebo groups, respectively. The fraction of patients with reduced pain, on the other hand, was similar in both groups.</p><p/><p>Reports of long-term neurologic outcomes following enzyme replacement therapy are limited.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One open-label extension study of the International Fabry Disease Study Group treated 58 patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-beta-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase beta</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every two weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. After 30 months (original placebo group) or 36 months (original treatment group) of enzyme replacement therapy, pain scores, as assessed by the McGill questionnaire, remained low in all patients. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurred in 5 of 58 patients (8.6 percent), one of whom had a prior history of stroke. There was no comparison control group, but the historic rate of stroke in the Genzyme data on file as reported by the authors was 13.7 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another open-label extension study included 25 adult men with Fabry disease who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase alfa</a> (0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> every other week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Stroke was not a prespecified outcome measure. However, during the 4 to 4.5 years of the study while on enzyme replacement therapy, four patients (16 percent) had a stroke or TIA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Fabry Outcome Survey included 545 patients from 11 European countries, of whom 314 had received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agalsidase-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">agalsidase alfa</a> for at least one (60 percent) or two (29 percent) years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Measures of pain and interference of pain with daily activities were variably improved at one and two years. There was a sustained improvement in quality of life at one and two years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Canadian Fabry disease initiative study, which followed adult subjects with Fabry disease for approximately five years, there was no difference in the rate of acute neurologic events comparing a cohorts of patients who started enzyme replacement therapy earlier in the course of disease (n = 86) with those who started such therapy later (n = 92) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, the number of events was small.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A longitudinal cohort study of over 200 adults and 7 children with Fabry disease found no association between time on enzyme replacement therapy and the risk of stroke or TIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, these and other data suggest that enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease decreases neuropathic pain, but does not reduce the risk of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations/abstract/34,40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,40,42</a>].
