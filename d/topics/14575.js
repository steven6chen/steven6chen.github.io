Frank cutaneous psoriasis is not always evident, and the extent of articular involvement may vary from mild enthesitis (inflammation of sites at which ligaments, tendons, and other fibrous structures insert into bone) to polyarticular involvement of multiple axial (spine, sacroiliac joints) and peripheral joints.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of psJIA are discussed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of psJIA are discussed separately, as is psoriatic arthritis in adults.

As in other subtypes of JIA, destructive arthritis may continue in the face of normal laboratory studies. Similarly, as with JIA generally, the role of conventional radiography in the day-to-day management of arthritis also is small since bony changes take months or years to become evident. Treatment should not be withheld because radiologic changes are not yet evident. Rather, careful clinical monitoring of the physical exam remains of paramount importance in following children with psoriatic arthritis. Monitoring for uveitis is discussed separately.

This imperative is particularly critical for the growing skeleton, where injury to growth plates and growth centers can cause permanent derangement of bone shape and length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Absence of pain and lack of functional impairment are imperfect guides to successful therapy since children may adapt remarkably well to ongoing arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Such children may still go on to experience substantial joint injury, developing functional impairment later in childhood or as young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The basic treatment algorithm of psJIA is similar to that employed in other subtypes of JIA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64063\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64063 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Overall, more than 80 percent of psJIA patients are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a>, and more than half receive tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists over the course of their illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are employed initially as the sole therapy by some rheumatologists but typically do not induce remission and are <strong>inappropriate</strong> as monotherapy for synovitis that persists beyond two months of treatment.

PsJIA has not been specifically studied, but decision analysis in oligoarticular JIA suggests that a strategy of upfront IA glucocorticoid injection is preferable to a trial of NSAIDs followed by IA for refractory disease due to the low probably (approximately 16 percent) that NSAIDs will induce remission within two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DMARDs are indicated at diagnosis in patients with involvement of multiple joints. The most commonly used DMARD is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a>. Methotrexate is associated with a higher risk of hepatotoxicity in adults with psoriatic arthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis, but methotrexate is typically well tolerated in children with psJIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Sulfasalazine</a> is an alternative, especially for lower-extremity large-joint arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to achieve remission is addressed by substitution or addition of a second oral DMARD, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>, or more commonly by institution of anti-TNF therapy with any of the available agents.

Clinical similarities between adult and pediatric psoriatic arthritis suggest that these form a spectrum of disease, a possibility supported by some genetic evidence, although the relevance of these findings remains to be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

In addition, systemic glucocorticoids can provoke a flare of cutaneous psoriasis when tapered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some data also suggest a risk for worsening psoriasis with antimalarials such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxychloroquine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These agents are therefore avoided when possible, although low- to moderate-dose systemic glucocorticoids are sometimes employed as short-term &quot;bridge&quot; therapy while awaiting the effect of slower-acting DMARDs in highly symptomatic patients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22628181\"><span class=\"h2\">Spondylitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of psoriatic spondylitis is based primarily upon experience with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Based upon observational data, our practice is to initiate anti-TNF therapy in all children with confirmed sacroiliitis, employing NSAIDs as adjuvant therapy if needed to provide complete symptomatic relief. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spondyloarthritis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spondyloarthritis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-guidelines-for-use-of-anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-agents-in-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-in-peripheral-and-non-radiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General guidelines for use of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents in ankylosing spondylitis and in peripheral and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Axial disease in psJIA tends to run a milder course than AS. However, treatment should be initiated in patients with psJIA who experience axial symptoms or show limitation of spinal mobility, even if changes have not yet developed on plain radiograph. Of note, spinal radiographs are much less sensitive in detecting early sacroiliitis than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and, therefore, we typically defer plain radiographs in favor of noncontrast MRI as the preferred mode of imaging in children with symptoms suggestive of sacroiliitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The benefit of continuous NSAID therapy is uncertain. In one adult trial, standing-dose versus as-needed NSAIDs resulted in measurable radiographic improvement, but the effect was small, and the finding was not replicated in a second, comparably sized RCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. There are no data that evaluate the role of NSAIDs in the setting of anti-TNF therapy. Standard DMARDs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sulfasalazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>, are of minimal benefit. Anti-TNF therapy is highly effective for axial disease as assessed both by symptoms and by MRI evidence of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Studies in adults with longstanding disease have not shown reduced radiographic progression, although data do support the possibility that early initiation of therapy may result in a more favorable outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. Early initiation may be particularly important in young people because early-onset spondyloarthropathies may run a more destructive course than later-onset disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22628189\"><span class=\"h2\">Uveitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for uveitis in psJIA is similar to that in other subtypes of JIA. Chronic anterior uveitis is treated initially with topical corticosteroids, usually together with oral or subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a>. Resistant disease often responds to an anti-TNF antibody such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">infliximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">adalimumab</a> (the anti-TNF receptor fusion protein <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">etanercept</a> is less effective for uveitis).

Conventional psoriasis treatment is appropriate for skin disease associated with psJIA, although, frequently, articular manifestations drive early use of systemic agents that are also highly effective for skin disease, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a> and TNF blockers. In patients with resistant skin disease, data from adult psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis suggest that therapy directed at the interleukin (IL) 17 pathway may provide relief for both skin and joints.

Nevertheless, compared with other patients with JIA, observational data suggest that those with psoriatic arthritis accumulate more inflamed joints and are less likely to enter sustained remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Among patients with psJIA followed for at least five years, from the prebiologic era (before approximately 2000 in pediatric rheumatology), persistently active disease was found in 70 percent and physical activity limitations in one-third [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In another series of children with JIA first admitted between 1980 and 1985 and followed for at least 15 years, 33 percent of patients with psJIA still required disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Poor outcomes and long-term disability were seen principally in patients who experienced a long delay in diagnosis or in whom effective therapy was not instituted, often through clinician or family reluctance to take the steps necessary to induce remission. In contrast, 91 percent of patients with psJIA in a large cohort of children diagnosed with JIA from 2005 to 2010 attained inactive disease within two years, and 47 percent achieved remission (defined as inactive disease &gt;12 months after discontinuing treatment) within five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3973151810\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used as initial monotherapy by some rheumatologists. However, NSAIDs typically do not induce remission and, therefore, are generally better used as adjuncts to DMARDs in patients with widespread or moderate to severe disease. Arthritis in individual large joints, as well as dactylitic digits, may be treated with glucocorticoid injections. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are indicated at diagnosis in patients with involvement of multiple joints or who fail to achieve remission with intra-articular (IA) glucocorticoids. Failure to achieve remission is addressed by addition of a second DMARD or, more commonly, by institution of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.
