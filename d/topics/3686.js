BMI is equal to the body weight (in kilograms) divided by the height (in meters) squared (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71431 \">table 1</a>). It correlates with adiposity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-the-obese-child-and-adolescent/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>] and complications of childhood overweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-the-obese-child-and-adolescent/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. Because BMI does not directly measure body fat, it may overestimate adiposity in a child with increased muscle mass (eg, an athlete), and underestimate adiposity in a child with reduced muscle mass (eg, a sedentary child). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-body-composition-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of body composition in children&quot;, section on 'Estimates of adiposity'</a>.) </p><p>All children older than two years should have their BMI calculated at least annually from measured height and weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-the-obese-child-and-adolescent/abstract/4,5,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,18,19</a>]. The results should be plotted on an appropriate growth curve to determine the BMI percentile and trend (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60784%7EPEDS%2F68478\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60784 graphicRef68478 \">figure 2A-B</a>).

Health care providers typically underestimate weight status on casual examination, so it is important to use measured heights and weights to determine and track obesity status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-the-obese-child-and-adolescent/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].
