However, identifying at triage or early in the ED evaluation which patients should be evaluated with an ECG is sometimes difficult. As one important example, a substantial number of patients ultimately diagnosed with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), particularly older patients, women, and diabetics, present with complaints other than chest discomfort. Such presentations are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Atypical symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>One research group has proposed the following rule for identifying patients at high risk for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who should be evaluated with an ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any patient over 30 with chest pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any patient over 50 with any of the following: dyspnea, altered mental status, upper extremity pain, syncope, or weakness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any patient over 80 with abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting</p><p/><p>This rule was derived and validated using information from over 3 million ED visits included in a state-wide health surveillance database. Included in the database were 6,464 cases of STEMI diagnosed during 2007 to 2008 that provided the dataset for the study. When applied to the validation sample (3,294 STEMI cases), the rule had a sensitivity of 91.9 percent (95% CI 90.9-92.8) and a specificity of 76.2 percent (95% CI 76.1-76.2). </p><p>This proposed rule should not replace clinical judgement (in fact the authors encourage clinicians to obtain an ECG based upon such judgement). As an example, a patient in whom a noncardiac diagnosis is likely (eg, younger patient with obvious zoster (shingles) lesions and no other symptoms) may not need an ECG. Nevertheless, this study provides some evidence for clinicians trying to devise appropriate triage protocols for the ED or to determine in which patients, including those not presenting with chest pain, an ECG assessment is needed. </p><p>Prospective validation of this decision rule is needed before widespread adoption can be recommended. Among the rule&rsquo;s limitations are its relatively low sensitivity and the age cut-offs, which may be too high in some settings. It is worth reiterating the importance of paying close attention to older patients, diabetics, and women with symptoms consistent with ACS and using a low threshold for obtaining an ECG in such patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ECG ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8275033\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial interpretation and criteria for ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific approaches to patients judged to have definite or probable acute coronary syndrome (ACS) based upon a targeted history and physical examination are initially guided by the accompanying 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The utility of epidemiologic risk factors in determining acute, individual risk has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">High-risk patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is at high-risk for ACS if ST segment depression (&ge;0.05 mV [0.5 mm]) is present in two or more contiguous leads or serum biomarkers are elevated.

Of note, relief of symptoms following the administration of therapeutic interventions (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>, &quot;GI cocktail&quot; of viscous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> and antacid) does <strong>NOT</strong> reliably distinguish nonischemic from ischemic chest pain.
