Serotypes A, B, Ba, and C cause trachoma, and serotypes D to K cause genital tract infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trachoma is endemic in over 42 countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is generally confined to resource-limited settings in developing nations of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, Pacific Islands, and remote Aboriginal communities in Australia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70030\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70030 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Worldwide, over 200 million people live in trachoma-endemic areas and 7.2 million live with advanced trachoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Active infection with <em>C. trachomatis</em> is mostly seen in young children with a peak incidence around four to six years, while subsequent scarring and blindness are seen in adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78281\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78281 \">figure 2</a>). In many regions, women have two to six times the rate of trachoma than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], which may be due to women's ongoing exposure to children with <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trachoma is spread by direct contact with eye, nose, and throat secretions from affected individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63925\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63925 \">figure 3</a>). It can also be spread by contact with fomites such as handkerchiefs, towels, or washcloths contaminated with these secretions. Eye-seeking flies such as <em>Musca sorbens</em> can carry <em>C. trachomatis</em>, but there is no animal or insect reservoir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19553762\"><span class=\"h2\">Survey assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since most patients with active trachoma are asymptomatic and are young children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78281\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78281 \">figure 2</a>), survey methods are needed to identify populations at risk. The choice of a survey method must take into account the anticipated trachoma prevalence and concerns specific to a local community. Population-based surveys remain the gold standard for determining prevalence and for establishing and monitoring intervention programs. Rapid assessment protocols also have an important role.</p><p>In population-based surveys, children aged one to nine years in regions at risk are surveyed to determine the prevalence of active trachoma (TF), and adults over 40 are surveyed to determine the prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis (TT) and cicatricial disease. The resulting prevalence data can be used to determine whether a control program is needed. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>However, population-based surveys have several limitations. Without a large sample size, this method may fail to detect a low prevalence of disease. Surveys are also expensive, time consuming, and may divert resources and attention from other important health issues in the community. For these reasons, rapid assessment protocols have been devised for more efficient trachoma screening:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trachoma rapid assessment (TRA) uses known socioeconomic conditions to select the highest risk areas of a region for initial screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The information can then be used to determine to prioritize where further surveys and treatment are needed, although it does not provide a prevalence estimate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acceptance Sampling Trachoma Rapid Assessment (ASTRA) screens children until a predetermined number with active disease are identified, at which point screening is ceased and work can commence on implementation of treatment programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Such surveys can be completed rapidly to facilitate early implementation of treatment programs when needed.</p><p/><p>According to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, all members of a community should receive mass antibiotic treatment when the prevalence of active trachoma among children &le;9 years of age is greater than 10 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78281\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78281 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of trachoma can be divided into two phases: active trachoma and cicatricial disease. Active trachoma is mostly seen in young children; cicatricial disease and blindness are seen in adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78281\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78281 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations are used to categorize the severity of infection in the Simplified World Health Organization (WHO) Trachoma Grading System (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54009 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. To grade the severity of infection, each eye should be examined with at least 2.5x magnification and a good light (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54272\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54272 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81505\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81505 \">picture 1</a>). The conjunctiva should be evaluated for inflammation or discharge, and it should be noted whether eyelashes rub against the cornea and whether eyelashes have been removed. The cornea should be examined for evidence of inflammation or opacification, and the upper lid should be everted to visualize the upper tarsal conjunctiva for evidence of follicles, inflammation, or scarring.</p><p>The Simplified WHO Trachoma Grading System is summarized below and in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54009 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trachomatous inflammation, follicular (TF) &ndash; Five or more follicles of &gt;0.5 mm on the upper tarsal conjunctiva, as in panel A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73800 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trachomatous inflammation, intense (TI) &ndash; Papillary hypertrophy and inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva obscuring more than half the deep tarsal vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81505\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81505 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trachomatous conjunctival scarring (TS) &ndash; Grossly visible scars on the tarsal conjunctiva, as in panel A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54671\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54671 \">picture 3</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) &ndash; At least one ingrown eyelash touching the globe or evidence of epilation (eyelash removal), as in panel A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62649\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62649 \">picture 4</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corneal opacity (CO) &ndash; Corneal opacity blurring part of the pupil margin, as in panel C (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62649\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62649 \">picture 4</a>)</p><p/><p>The signs in the WHO Trachoma Grading System are useful for decisions regarding intervention. The prevalence of active trachoma (TF or TI) in children aged one to nine is the key index for determining whether an area needs mass antibiotic treatment and hygienic interventions. The prevalence of trichiasis (TT) determines the probable need for surgical services. The prevalence of corneal opacity (CO) is a rough measure of the burden of visual impairment due to trachoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Active trachoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An initial isolated infection with <em>C. trachomatis</em> causes a mild, self-limited follicular conjunctivitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54272\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54272 \">figure 4</a>). Although some individuals with active trachoma have a mucopurulent discharge, the majority of cases are relatively asymptomatic, and a screening program is generally required to establish the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19553762\" class=\"local\">'Survey assessment'</a> above.)</p><p>The major physical finding of active trachoma is the characteristic follicle on the superior tarsal conjunctiva (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52885\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52885 \">figure 5</a>). The follicles are large, white or pale yellow foci of inflammatory material with a diameter of 0.5 to 2 mm, as in panel A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73800 \">picture 2</a>). An individual with five or more follicles should be categorized as WHO grade TF or TI depending on the severity of inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54009 \">table 1</a>). Papillae may appear alongside the follicles as pinpoint red dots but can become much larger and can coalesce to give the conjunctiva a thickened and edematous appearance, as in panel B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81505\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81505 \">picture 1</a>). In later disease, the follicles leave grossly visible shallow pits in the cornea (Herbert's pits) that are pathognomonic for trachoma, as in panel B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73800 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>These findings of active trachoma are largely observed in children. Older individuals with <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection often do not display a follicular response but may develop a papillary reaction, particularly if there is secondary bacterial infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cicatricial disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity and duration of active trachoma infection predicts the likelihood of progression to cicatricial disease in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Repeated episodes of infection cause marked conjunctival inflammation, leading to eyelid scarring, as in panel A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54671\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54671 \">picture 3</a>). A thick band near the lid margin (Arlt's line) may also be seen, as in panel B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54671\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54671 \">picture 3</a>). These findings correspond with WHO grade TS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54009 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Eyelid scar tissue eventually contracts and can distort the lid margin leading to entropion (inward rolling of the eyelid) and subsequent trichiasis (ingrown eyelashes), as in panel A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62649\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62649 \">picture 4</a>). These findings correlate with WHO grade TT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54009 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Individuals with trichiasis have a greatly increased risk of blindness and, for this reason, trichiasis is staged as minor (one to five eyelashes touching the globe) or major (more than five eyelashes touching the globe). The finding of trichiasis should prompt surgical intervention (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below).</p><p>Eyelash abrasion on the cornea leads to corneal edema, ulceration, and scarring. If untreated, corneal pannus (inflammatory vascular tissue) eventually develops, as in panel B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62649\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62649 \">picture 4</a>), followed by corneal opacification, as in panel C (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62649\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62649 \">picture 4</a>), and loss of vision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19552949\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In endemic areas, the diagnosis of trachoma is made on the basis of the clinical manifestations of the infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19</a>]. The findings are then used to categorize the severity of disease using the Simplified World Health Organization Trachoma Grading System (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54009 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], which is used by most trachoma control programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Laboratory tests available for the diagnosis of <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection include immunofluorescent cytology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Giemsa cytology, and culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These are useful in research studies or for diagnosis in areas with low prevalence. As the positive predictive value of clinical diagnosis for trachoma falls with decreasing prevalence, microbiologic diagnosis may become a more important tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. PCR tests provide the highest sensitivity; within trachoma elimination programs, serological tests may provide an objective measure of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19553596\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternative causes of conjunctivitis should also be considered. These include bacterial, viral, and allergic etiologies.

Patients often have associated atopy and may suffer from eczema, hay fever, or asthma. A white, stringy discharge of mucus is common. Symptoms can be seasonal. The diagnosis is made clinically based on suggestive clinical history and consistent signs and symptoms.

The tarsal conjunctiva may have a follicular appearance, and a tender, enlarged preauricular node may be present. Features that distinguish viral conjunctivitis from trachoma include a history of upper respiratory tract infection, rapid progression over several days, and the presence of a mucopurulent discharge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conjunctivitis&quot;, section on 'Viral conjunctivitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial conjunctivitis &ndash; Patients with bacterial conjunctivitis present with redness and purulent discharge in one or both eyes. Discharge appears at the lid margins and corners of the eye, and more discharge appears within minutes of wiping the lids. Follicle formation is rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conjunctivitis&quot;, section on 'Bacterial conjunctivitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypersensitivity conjunctivitis &ndash; Chronic exposure to drugs, eye cosmetics, soaps, or other chemicals can lead to a hypersensitivity reaction that can appear follicular in nature. A detailed history is vital to identify and remove the causative agent.

The eye infection presents as a unilateral (or sometimes bilateral) follicular conjunctivitis of weeks to months duration that has not responded to topical antibiotic therapy. It does not progress to scarring and trichiasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis#H851297358\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conjunctivitis&quot;, section on 'Adult inclusion conjunctivitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome &ndash; Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome is an atypical form of cat scratch disease that can include conjunctivitis, conjunctival granuloma, and adjacent preauricular lymphadenopathy.

Azithromycin is preferred because it is given as a single oral dose, although it is generally available only as part of the international donation program organized by Pfizer through the International Trachoma Initiative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Azithromycin is considered safe for use in children from the age of six months and for pregnant women.</p><p>Topical agents may be a useful alternative in areas where oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> is not readily available. Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> treatment may be used in pregnancy. Alternatively, topical azithromycin (1.5%) for three days (inserted in the morning and evening) may be as effective as oral azithromycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Randomized trials have shown that a single dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> is as effective as a long course of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> for the treatment of active trachoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].

In this trial, 80 percent of patients with minor trichiasis (one to five eyelashes touching the globe) who underwent BTR had subsequent complete lid closure with no evidence of ingrown eyelashes, compared with only 29 percent of patients treated with epilation (eyelash removal) by electrolysis or cryoablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. For major trichiasis (more than five eyelashes touching the globe), BTR was superior to tarsal advance and rotation (favorable outcomes in 77 versus 41 percent).

Recurrence may be due to progressive natural history of the disease or repeat infection with further scarring.

The benefit of perioperative azithromycin may be more significant in the setting of severe trichiasis (lashes touching the cornea or more than five lashes touching the globe) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. A randomized trial conducted in the Gambia assessing adjuvant postoperative azithromycin demonstrated that, for those who received azithromycin, at one year there was no reduction in the trichiasis recurrence rate (over 40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Subsequently, a randomized trial of 1452 patients in Ethiopia showed that single-dose azithromycin reduced postoperative trichiasis recurrence rates by one-third compared with topical tetracycline (7 versus 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Corneal transplant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been limited evaluation of corneal transplant (penetrating keratoplasty) for treating corneal opacification.

Because blindness due to trachoma is irreversible, the strategy focuses on prevention. Surgical correction of trichiasis prevents the development of corneal opacification, while antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvements may disrupt the cycle of reinfection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19554198\"><span class=\"h2\">Mass treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic therapy for trachoma is best managed within an entire region rather than on an individual basis, since <em>C. trachomatis</em> is highly infectious and transmitted rapidly in areas of poor hygiene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/11,20,29,30,59-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20,29,30,59-63</a>].</p><p>We are in agreement with WHO guidelines that recommend that a region should undergo mass antibiotic treatment when the prevalence of active trachoma among one- to nine-year-old children (as assessed clinically) is greater than 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

If the prevalence among one- to nine-year-old children is less than 10 percent, antibiotic treatment should be administered to households of individuals with active trachoma.</p><p>It is uncertain whether the strategy described above is always appropriate; in some reports, one or two treatments may be sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>], and decline in the prevalence of clinical trachoma can lag behind the fall in the prevalence of infection detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of conjunctival swabs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. RNA-based testing may be more sensitive for detection of ocular chlamydia than DNA-based testing, although the clinical significance of this is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>In areas where the prevalence is greater than 50 percent, repeated mass antibiotic distribution may be a viable tool for trachoma elimination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-71</a>]. This was illustrated in a study of three Ethiopian villages including 710 patients who received biannual mass oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> distribution; over a 30-month period, the mean prevalence declined from 43 to &lt;1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>It is uncertain whether there is benefit of biannual treatment over annual treatment.

However, a subsequent randomized trial comparing annual with biannual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> treatment noted comparable rates of infection at 18, 32, and 40 months following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Another trial observed that biannual treatment of children alone was comparable to annual treatment of the entire community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Mass antibiotic treatment of children may confer &quot;herd protection&quot;: the prevalence of infection in the community has been shown to decrease when antibiotic treatment is provided only to children under 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In addition, some data suggest that mass antibiotic treatment for trachoma confers additional benefits (unrelated to trachoma), including reduction in childhood mortality (due to other infections, including respiratory infections, diarrhea, and malaria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/64,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19555783\"><span class=\"h2\">Facial cleanliness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with grossly visible nasal discharge, ocular discharge, or flies on their faces are at least twice as likely to have active trachoma as children with clean faces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].</p><p>There has been one randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of facial cleanliness for prevention of trachoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].

Antibiotics alone lowered the frequency of active disease in all communities, although the prevalence of active disease was returning toward pretreatment levels by 12 months. However, antibiotics combined with community-based health education significantly reduced the prevalence of intense trachoma (odds of having severe trachoma in intervention villages were 0.62 compared with villages receiving antibiotics alone).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental improvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. trachomatis</em> is highly infectious and transmitted rapidly in areas of poor hygiene.

Modifications in water use, fly control, latrine use, health education, and proximity to domesticated animals have all been proposed to reduce transmission of <em>C. trachomatis</em>. These changes pose numerous challenges for implementation and rigorous study, although some interesting observations have been made with regard to water use and fly control.</p><p>Availability of clean water is a critical resource for facial cleanliness. In a study from Tanzania, the risk of trachoma in the household increased with distance from a water source, although there was no association with the quantity of water brought into the house [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. It may be that the distance between a home and its water supply influences a family's prioritization of water use for hygienic purposes. Thus, modifying the perception of how water should be used in the home may be at least as important as making water more accessible.</p><p>Household fly density is a potentially amenable risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In a randomized trial in Tanzania, the insecticide <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">permethrin</a> was used for fly control in one group of villages while another group was monitored as controls; mass treatment with single-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> was provided to both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Permethrin significantly reduced fly counts at most time intervals. However, the trachoma rate did not differ significantly at six months or one year (43 versus 44 percent). The authors concluded that insecticide spraying after mass antibiotic treatment does not reduce trachoma prevalence.</p><p>In comparison, an earlier trial in Gambia without mass antibiotic therapy found that insecticide spraying produced a reduction in trachoma prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. This trial also evaluated the effect of latrine provision for fly control, and, compared with controls, a reduction in trachoma prevalence was also shown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachoma/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trachoma is a contagious eye infection caused by <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. Active infection with <em>C. trachomatis</em> is mostly seen in young children, while subsequent scarring and blindness (cicatricial disease) is seen in adults. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of an endemic area requires a population assessment to look for the characteristic clinical manifestations of the disease.

Subsequent annual treatment should be administered for three years, at which time the prevalence should be reassessed. Annual treatment should continue until the prevalence drops below 5 percent; thereafter, mass antibiotic treatment may be discontinued. It is important that the facial cleanliness and environmental improvement strategy components be continued together with ongoing monitoring.

If azithromycin is not available, ophthalmic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> (1% eye ointment twice a day for six weeks) can be used. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To minimize risk of blindness, patients with trichiasis should have a surgical procedure to protect the cornea from ongoing contact with eyelashes.
