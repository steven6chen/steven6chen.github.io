Normally, a person's hip joint can move smoothly in many directions.</p><p>When people have problems with their hip joint, the hip can be painful, stiff, and have trouble moving normally. Different conditions can cause problems with the hip joint, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoarthritis &ndash; This is the most common type of arthritis and often comes with age.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip problems that people are born with or get during childhood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip injuries</p><p/><p>Hip replacement is a treatment that can reduce hip pain and improve the way the hip moves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23883885\"><span class=\"h1\">When are hip joint problems treated with hip replacement?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hip joint problems from arthritis can be treated with hip replacement right away. But doctors often suggest trying other treatments first, such as weight loss, medicines, physical therapy, or devices such as canes or walkers. If these treatments do not help enough, then doctors might suggest hip replacement.</p><p>One reason doctors suggest trying other treatments first, especially for younger people, is that a replacement hip joint can wear out over time. Hip replacements usually last at least 10 to 15 years, and some last longer. The number of years a replacement joint lasts depends on different things, such as how active the person is.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23883892\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during hip replacement surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hip replacement surgery takes place in an operating room in a hospital. A doctor will give you medicines to make you sleep and to numb your body. Then your doctor will make a cut on your outer hip and thigh. He or she will replace your hip joint with a manmade hip joint, called a prosthesis. A prosthesis can be made out of plastic, metal, or ceramic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65030\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65030 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23883899\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After surgery, most people stay in the hospital for 2 to 4 days. While you are in the hospital, you will get:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to treat your pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic medicines to prevent infections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to prevent blood clots in the legs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special boots or stockings to prevent blood clots in the legs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy &ndash; Most people are able to stand and walk (with help) within 1 day after surgery. The physical therapist will teach you exercises to make the muscles around your hip stronger. He or she will work with you on bending, walking, and climbing stairs so that you can move normally.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23883906\"><span class=\"h1\">Where do I go after I leave the hospital?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people go home. But some people stay in a nursing home or rehabilitation facility for a short time in order to get stronger before going home. Wherever you go, you will need to do your exercises and have physical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23883913\"><span class=\"h1\">When will I be able to do my usual activities again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people can do their usual activities again within 3 to 6 months. Your doctor or nurse will tell you if there are any activities that you should avoid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23883920\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can people have from hip replacement?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People can have different problems from hip replacement, but serious problems are uncommon. Problems from hip replacement can happen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During hip replacement &ndash; For example, a bone can break, or nerves or blood vessels can be damaged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right after hip replacement &ndash; People can get an infection or blood clots in the legs. Also, the thigh bone or prosthesis can pop out of place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Years after hip replacement &ndash; The hip joint can become loose and pop out of place, become stiff, or wear out.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23883927\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if hip replacement is right for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help you decide if hip replacement is right for you, talk with your doctor or nurse. You can ask him or her:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of hip replacement?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to hip replacement?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides hip replacement?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have hip replacement?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23883934\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hip-pain-in-older-people-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hip pain in older people (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hip-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hip fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-blood-clots-in-the-legs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the legs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-replacement-arthroplasty-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Total hip replacement (arthroplasty) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Joint infection (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
