Advantages of office biopsy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal to no cervical dilation is required.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local or no anesthesia is generally required.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Performing the procedure in an office setting is less expensive than a procedure in the operating room.</p><p/><p>There is an excellent correlation between the histopathology of endometrial specimens taken by biopsy instruments in the office and D&amp;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, since less than 50 percent of the endometrium is sampled, malignancy can be missed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69145\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69145 \">table 2</a>). Despite some limitations, numerous studies have shown that the endometrium is adequately sampled with biopsy techniques:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 39 studies involving 7914 women compared the results of endometrial sampling with histopathology at D&amp;C, hysteroscopy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The significant findings from this analysis were:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The Pipelle device was more sensitive for the detection of endometrial cancer and atypical hyperplasia than all other sampling devices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The sensitivity for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer (by Pipelle) in postmenopausal women was 99.6 percent and in premenopausal women was 91 percent.

The posttest probability of endometrial cancer after a positive test was 82 percent (95% CI, 60 to 93 percent), and after a negative test it was 0.9 percent (95% CI, 0.4 to 2.4 percent). In this analysis, 15 percent (138 of 945) of specimens were inadequate (no sample or insufficient tissue for assessment), and one case of cancer was subsequently found among these patients.</p><p/><p>All sampling devices perform better when pathology is global rather than focal; this has been demonstrated repeatedly in multiple studies. As an example, the importance of the volume of disease was illustrated in a study of 65 patients with known cancer who underwent Pipelle biopsy prior to hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Endometrial sampling was most reliable when at least one-half of the endometrium was affected by disease. Five patients had tumors present only in an endometrial polyp.</p><p>For this reason, additional endometrial assessment should be performed if abnormal uterine bleeding persists after a &quot;benign&quot; endometrial biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Benign endometrial histology includes atrophy (absence of a hormonal effect), proliferative endometrium (estrogen effect), secretory endometrium (progestin effect), disordered or dyssynchronous endometrium (implies irregular shedding of the endometrium secondary to unopposed estrogen), and endometritis. Further endometrial assessment should also be considered when the endometrial biopsy is nondiagnostic, but a high suspicion of cancer remains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nondiagnostic biopsies may be associated with polyps, fibroids, endometrial cancer, or other lesions occupying an area of the uterus that was not sampled. Additional endometrial assessment may include a combination of repeat endometrial biopsy or D&amp;C hysteroscopy combined with transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS). </p><p>If endometrial biopsy does not yield sufficient tissue for pathological diagnosis, then the clinical setting should dictate further management. We suggest TVUS if the woman is postmenopausal and the bleeding has not been persistent; a thin endometrial stripe in this setting is most consistent with atrophy and does not require further invasive studies. A thick endometrial stripe, persistent bleeding, or bleeding in women who are in the menopausal transition or are postmenopausal should be followed by additional endometrial sampling, such as hysteroscopy with curettage.</p><p>The diagnosis of early-grade endometrial cancer by pathologic evaluation is sometimes controversial, as the distinction between high-grade precancers and cancer may be unclear, and different examiners may have different opinions regarding the diagnosis. If there is a management decision that may be affected by this distinction, additional slide review or additional markers may be requested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dilation and curettage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, endometrial biopsy in the office has generally replaced diagnostic D&amp;C, but there is still a role for this procedure for some women.

However, hysteroscopy requires more skill and is more costly and invasive than most other modalities of endometrial assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hysteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hysteroscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who have one of the indications above and who proceed to diagnostic D&amp;C should also be consented for diagnostic hysteroscopy at the same time. Multiple studies have shown that hysteroscopy can aid in the detection of focal lesions of the endometrial lining that may be missed by D&amp;C alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, in one large study of 1286 women, endometrial cancer was missed in 10 women (34.5 percent) using hysteroscopy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Therefore, for women at risk for endometrial cancer, we advise performing <strong>both</strong> procedures (visualization and biopsy). This is consistent with guidelines from the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists that advises that when hysteroscopy is used, biopsy should be performed of any discrete lesions as well as of the random background endometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Small polyps can usually be removed at the same time.</p><p>The decision as to whether to perform a diagnostic hysteroscopy in the operating room or in the office depends upon provider preference and equipment, the indications for the procedure, and patient <span class=\"nowrap\">comfort/preference</span>. The option of <span class=\"nowrap\">operative/therapeutic</span> hysteroscopy should also be discussed with the patient. Because therapeutic hysteroscopy involves greater risk than diagnostic hysteroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], its use should be reserved for women at low risk of endometrial cancer, and in whom the value of hysteroscopic resection of a lesion is clear (ie, heavy bleeding in a premenopausal woman who desires to maintain her fertility).</p><p>Patients in whom a diagnosis of cancer is possible should have a diagnostic procedure followed by definitive treatment.</p><p>In women at risk for cancer, the risk of possible cancer dissemination due to intraperitoneal spillage of the endometrial cells is discussed below.

Any focal endometrial lesion requires a biopsy. </p><p>Sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness is performed by scanning the uterus in a sagittal view. The result reported is the double layer endometrial thickness measured in an anteroposterior dimension from one basalis layer to the other, excluding any fluid within the cavity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3255536\"><span class=\"h4\">Women with postmenopausal bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women with postmenopausal bleeding and not on hormonal replacement therapy, an endometrial thickness of less than or equal to 4 or 5 mm is associated with a low risk of endometrial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Cancer becomes increasingly more frequent relative to benign disease as the endometrial thickness approaches 20 mm, which was the mean endometrial thickness in 759 women with endometrial cancer in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (SRU) advise that either TVUS (with an endometrial thickness of &le;4 mm [ACOG] or &le;5 mm [SRU]) or endometrial sampling are effective as a first diagnostic step in women with postmenopausal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In addition, ACOG advises that TVUS is useful as a second-line test when endometrial sampling yielded insufficient tissue. In such cases, they advised that if the endometrial thickness is &le;4 mm, then malignancy is rare. In addition, ultrasound may identify a structural lesion (eg, polyp). </p><p>These recommendations are supported by a meta-analysis of 35 prospective studies that included data from almost 6000 women with postmenopausal bleeding. The sensitivity and specificity of TVUS for detection of endometrial cancer at a 4 mm thickness threshold were 96 and 53 percent, and at a 5 mm threshold the sensitivity and specificity were 96 and 61 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Maximizing the sensitivity is the most important goal in using TVUS to evaluate postmenopausal bleeding, since the priority is to detect all cancers. A low specificity is less concerning, since positive results are followed with endometrial sampling prior to definitive treatment. The authors of this analysis calculated that the probability of endometrial cancer (based upon the average risk associated with postmenopausal bleeding) was 1 percent following a normal (&lt;5 mm endometrial thickness) TVUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>However, subsequent meta-analyses have reached different conclusions. The best designed meta-analysis used individual patient data from 13 studies, including almost 3000 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This study reported that the sensitivity of TVUS for detection of endometrial cancer for 4 mm and 5 mm were 95 and 90 percent, respectively; at 3 mm, the sensitivity was 98 percent. A limitation of this analysis was that many studies were excluded because individual patient data were not available.</p><p>Another meta-analysis consisted of 57 studies with 9031 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The four highest quality studies used the &le;5 mm cut-off level. Using the pooled estimates from these four studies only, a positive test result raised the probability of carcinoma from 14 to 31 percent, while a negative test reduced it to 2.5 percent. The authors concluded that a negative result (&le;5 mm) usually excluded endometrial neoplasia, but ultrasound measurement of endometrial thickness alone could not be used to reliably exclude cancer.</p><p>A meta-analysis of nine studies (3483 women without endometrial cancer and 380 with the disease) found that the detection rate for endometrial cancer varied according to the parameters used for the test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The detection rate was 63 percent (95% CI 58-69) when considering an endometrial thickness that resulted in a false-positive rate of only 10 percent; however, the detection rate increased to 96 percent (95% CI 94-98) if a false-positive rate of 50 percent was considered acceptable. The authors concluded that even with a lower threshold for calling results suspicious, 4 percent of endometrial cancers would be missed; thus, further invasive diagnostic testing was indicated in all symptomatic women with a &quot;thin&quot; endometrial thickness. They also noted that median endometrial thickness varied among centers such that 5 mm may not be a universally reliable threshold.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3255342\"><span class=\"h4\">Asymptomatic women with endometrial thickening or fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thickened endometrium or fluid within the endometrial cavity can be an incidental finding on an ultrasound examination performed for an indication other than evaluation of the endometrium. Further evaluation of the endometrium in these women is sometimes indicated. Most cases of endometrial cancer present with abnormal uterine bleeding, but no bleeding is present in approximately 5 to 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>It appears that endometrial thickness is less predictive of endometrial neoplasia in asymptomatic women (those without postmenopausal uterine bleeding, not even red, pink, or brown spotting or staining). This was illustrated in a meta-analysis of 32 studies including 11,000 asymptomatic postmenopausal women who were not using hormone therapy; the mean endometrial thickness was 2.9 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. An endometrial thickness of &ge;5 mm had a sensitivity of 83 percent and a specificity of 72 percent for detecting endometrial carcinoma, which are lower than in symptomatic women. There were few data for an endometrial thickness larger than 5 mm.</p><p>A well-designed decision analysis calculated that postmenopausal women without uterine bleeding who had an endometrial thickness &gt;11 mm had an endometrial cancer risk of 6.7 percent, which is similar to that in postmenopausal women with bleeding and endometrial thickness &gt;5 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Based on this analysis, we suggest sampling the endometrium of postmenopausal women without uterine bleeding who have an endometrial thickness &gt;11 mm.<br/><br/>We also sample postmenopausal women without uterine bleeding with lesser degrees of endometrial thickening if endometrial fluid is visualized on ultrasound. In most of these women, endometrial fluid is related to cervical stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Observational studies have consistently found that asymptomatic postmenopausal women with endometrial fluid and an endometrial thickness smaller than 3 mm do not have endometrial cancer or hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/25,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27-30</a>]. However, there is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in women with endometrial fluid and endometrial thickening &gt;3 mm; therefore, we biopsy these women.<br/><br/>Pelvic pain, a common reason for pelvic imaging, is not an indication for endometrial sampling in the absence of abnormal uterine bleeding or suspicious sonographic findings.</p><p>A detailed discussion of choosing a clinical approach to postmenopausal bleeding can be found separately.

In one study of 200 premenopausal women with AUB, 16 of 80 women (20 percent) with an endometrial stripe &lt;5 mm were subsequently found to have an endometrial polyp or submucosal leiomyoma as the source of their bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In premenopausal women, TVUS should be performed on day 4, 5, or 6 of the bleeding cycle, when the endometrium is expected to be its thinnest (in reproductive-age women, normal endometrial thickness in the proliferative phase is 4 to 8 mm and in the secretory phase 8 to 14 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51541\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51541 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Persistent bleeding <strong>always</strong> requires endometrial biopsy regardless of ultrasound findings. We tell patients that bleeding is common when ET is initiated and should decrease over time. If it does not, and if it becomes heavier, or bleeding occurs after a long period of no bleeding, then a biopsy is indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Women on tamoxifen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, both for treatment and prevention of breast cancer, are known to have thickened endometrial stripes.

In general, we do not feel there is a role for baseline endometrial assessment, but women should have an endometrial biopsy if any abnormal bleeding occurs, as tamoxifen confers a slight increase in endometrial cancer risk (roughly <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000)</span>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Saline infusion sonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Saline infusion sonography (SIS) (also called sonohysterography) is an imaging technique in which sterile saline is instilled into the endometrial cavity and TVUS is performed. This procedure allows for careful architectural evaluation of the uterine cavity to detect small lesions (eg, polyps or small submucous fibroids) that may be missed on TVUS or by blind endometrial sampling. In one study, as an example, the sensitivity and specificity of SIS for detection of polyps were significantly higher than for TVUS alone (93 and 94 percent for SIS versus 75 and 76 percent for TVUS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Endometrial biopsy is a more cost-effective initial approach than ultrasound when the prevalence of endometrial carcinoma is at least 15 percent. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transvaginal pelvic ultrasound is an acceptable alternative initial test in postmenopausal women who cannot tolerate office biopsy, or in women who need concurrent evaluation of the adnexae. A summary of the literature suggests that using an endometrial cutoff of &le;4 mm would yield a false-negative rate for endometrial cancer of 0.25 to 0.5 percent, which compares favorably with the false-negative rate reported for endometrial biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Transvaginal ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients evaluated with pelvic ultrasound, endometrial biopsy is required for histological diagnosis if the endometrium is not adequately visualized, the endometrial stripe thicker than 4 mm (focal or global), and in women with persistent bleeding. Blind biopsy is most accurate in women with a globally thickened endometrium; visually directed sampling (ie, hysteroscopy) is preferable for women with focal abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of persistent bleeding</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent abnormal bleeding in peri or postmenopausal women is worrisome even with a benign or negative initial evaluation. Two studies have followed patients with a negative initial biopsy and found up to 20 percent of the patients were eventually diagnosed with either complex atypical hyperplasia or cancer. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent bleeding is worrisome even when the endometrial thickness is &lt;4 mm, particularly if there are other risk factors for endometrial cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58600 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62089\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62089 \">table 4</a>). Endometrial cancer can still occur in this setting since serous carcinoma of the endometrium may arise from atrophic endometrium. Therefore, further diagnostic evaluation is indicated. Depending upon the prior evaluation, a combination of repeat endometrial biopsy or dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) hysteroscopy combined with transvaginal sonohysterography or ultrasonography should be pursued. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Transvaginal ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for a nonendometrial source of bleeding, such as cervical, fallopian tube, or ovarian cancer, should also be pursued.
