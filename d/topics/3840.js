Pregnancy should be suspected whenever a woman in her childbearing years misses a menstrual period: ie, she notes that a week or more has passed without the onset of an expected menses. Clinical suspicion is increased if she also reports any sexual activity while not using contraception or with inconsistent use of contraception. Even women who report consistent use of contraception may become pregnant because of user issues and because no method is 100 percent effective (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Cessation of menses can be a difficult symptom to evaluate because some women have irregular menstrual cycles and many women have occasional prolongation of a cycle.

The correlation between uterine size and gestational age is often described in terms of fruit (eg, 6- to 8-week size = small pear, 8- to 10-week size = orange, 10- to 12-week size = grapefruit). The uterus remains a pelvic organ until approximately 12 weeks of gestation, when it becomes sufficiently large to palpate abdominally just above the symphysis pubis, unless the woman is obese. At 16 weeks, the uterine fundus is palpable midway between the symphysis pubis and umbilicus.

This is the earliest that hCG can be detected with an ultrasensitive test. Late implantation has been associated with an increased risk of pregnancy loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The hCG concentration doubles every 29 to 53 hours during the first 30 days after implantation of a viable, intrauterine pregnancy; a slower rise is suggestive of an abnormal pregnancy (eg, ectopic, early embryonic death).

Although a report of delayed menses, sexual activity with imperfect use of contraception, and patient suspicion of pregnancy are predictive that a pregnancy test will be positive, these historical factors are not sufficiently reliable to diagnose or exclude pregnancy. Nausea with or without vomiting, if present, increases the likelihood of pregnancy, but some women do not experience these symptoms or merely have not experienced them before being tested.</p><p>Only a few studies have examined the value of physical examination for diagnosing early pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60503\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60503 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy/abstract/27,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,32,33</a>]. The likelihood of pregnancy increases if signs of pregnancy are present, but absence of these signs does not rule out pregnancy. Obviously, the ability to detect physical signs of pregnancy is highly dependent upon the experience of the examiner.

Very early in gestation, the rise in hCG titers is similar among women with viable pregnancies and allows estimation of pregnancy duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. A study using a home-based device (Clearblue Advanced Pregnancy Test with Weeks Estimator) was able to estimate time since ovulation (one to two weeks, two to three weeks, three or more weeks) in singleton viable pregnancies with an accuracy of 93 percent when compared with standard reference methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104487144\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of pregnancy tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy tests can be performed on urine or serum. Factors that influence the choice of a urine or serum pregnancy test include duration of missed menses, need for accuracy, convenience, and cost. Tests on urine are adequate for diagnosis of a suspected pregnancy in women who have missed a menstrual period, especially when there is time to follow an initial negative test with a second test a week later. Because urine tests are slightly less sensitive than serum tests, a urine test may be negative and the serum test positive around the time of missed menses; therefore, serum tests are preferable when the patient&rsquo;s menstrual period is less than a week late, especially when exclusion of pregnancy is an important factor in patient care, such as before administering a potentially teratogenic agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104487168\"><span class=\"h3\">Serum pregnancy test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In clinical practice, the most sensitive method for detecting hCG in early pregnancy is a serum pregnancy test. Qualitative serum pregnancy tests typically detect hCG levels of 5 to 10 milli-int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> while a high-sensitivity, quantitative serum beta-hCG assay can measure hCG values as low as 1 to 2 milli-int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. By contrast, the urine pregnancy test is less sensitive, detecting hCG beginning at a level of 20 to 50 milli-int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. The median hCG concentration is higher in serum than in urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy/abstract/17,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,40</a>]; therefore, early in pregnancy, a serum pregnancy test may be positive while the urine pregnancy test is still negative.</p><p>The only potential advantage of a qualitative serum pregnancy test over a quantitative test is that the qualitative test can usually be performed more rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The quantitative test procedure requires use of dedicated automated measurement equipment and may be processed only in a commercial or hospital-based laboratory.

The performance of HPTs is affected by the users' technique and interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Manual tests are interpreted by noting the number of color <span class=\"nowrap\">bands/lines</span> in the window of the device a few minutes after dipping it in urine for several seconds.

Some devices have a digital display that shows &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; or &ldquo;pregnant&rdquo; or &ldquo;not pregnant&rdquo; on an LCD screen.</p><p>Although manufacturers claim these kits are 99 percent accurate, this claim is based upon the ability of the test to detect an arbitrary amount of intact hCG added to nonpregnant urine samples in vitro. In many cases, it will not be sensitive enough to diagnose pregnancy in women who have recently missed a menstrual period.</p><p>The most common problem with HPT kits is a negative result because the test was performed too soon after the expected onset of menses. The intervals between the first day of the LMP, ovulation, fertilization, implantation, and production of sufficient hCG for detection by a HPT are variable. If pregnancy is suspected despite a negative test, the test should be repeated in one week. Many HPT kits make this recommendation and provide an extra kit for this purpose.</p><p>HPT kits vary in sensitivity for detection of hCG. This variability was demonstrated by a blinded in vitro sensitivity analysis of six commonly used HPT kits that found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;First Response manual&rdquo; and &ldquo;First Response Gold digital devices&quot; were the most sensitive HPT kits with analytical sensitivity 5.5 milli-int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>.

The test is negative because ovulation (and thus fertilization, implantation, and first day of the missed menstrual period) occurred later than expected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>If pregnancy is suspected despite a negative test, the test should be repeated in one week. Waiting a week or two after a missed period before performing a urine pregnancy test not only minimizes false negatives, but also decreases the tendency to perform a serum hCG test to exclude or confirm very early pregnancy after a negative urine test. Women with irregular cycles or an uncertain LMP generally should wait at least 14 days from a sexual act before obtaining a pregnancy test.</p><p>Rarely, false negative results are due to a &ldquo;hook effect&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. When a very high hCG concentration is present and the sample is tested without prior dilution, both the capture and tracer antibodies used in immunoradiometric assays become saturated, preventing the binding of the two to create a sandwich. Since the non-sandwiched tracer antibodies are washed away with the excess material, the test result will be negative. This is most commonly seen with the very high hCG levels associated with gestational trophoblastic disease; hCG levels are generally lower in normal pregnancies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-chorionic-gonadotropin-testing-in-pregnancy-and-gestational-trophoblastic-disease-and-causes-of-low-persistent-levels#H17620393\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human chorionic gonadotropin: Testing in pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease and causes of low persistent levels&quot;, section on 'False negative test (hook effect)'</a>.)</p><p>False negative results caused by limited or no detection of hCG isoforms can cause misdiagnosis in cases of very early pregnancy. Almost all hCG in blood is in the form of the intact hormone (alpha and beta dimer), with only small amounts of the free alpha- and beta-subunits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In urine, however, a large proportion of hCG is a metabolic fragment of the hormone known as the beta-core. An assay&rsquo;s inability to recognize specific isoforms of hCG can play a role in false negative results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy/abstract/34,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,53,54</a>].
