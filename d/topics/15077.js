Next to cortical blindness, ROP is the most common cause of childhood blindness in the United States. Other ophthalmologic disorders that occur frequently in preterm infants include amblyopia, strabismus, and refractive errors.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of ROP are discussed in this topic. The pathogenesis, epidemiology, classification, and screening for ROP are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinopathy of prematurity: Pathogenesis, epidemiology, classification, and screening&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Other common eye problems in preterm infants are discussed separately.

Treatment is initiated when the infant develops type I ROP (also called &quot;high-risk prethreshold ROP&quot;). Type I ROP is defined as any of the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinopathy of prematurity: Pathogenesis, epidemiology, classification, and screening&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any stage ROP with plus disease in zone I</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3 ROP without plus disease in zone I</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2 or 3 ROP with plus disease in zone II</p><p/><p>Treatment is generally <strong>not</strong> indicated for eyes that do not meet criteria for type I ROP.

Treatment may consist of retinal ablative therapy (with laser photocoagulation) or intravitreal injection of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agent. (See <a href=\"#H3375024034\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapies'</a> below.)</p><p>Retinal ablative therapy reduces the incidence of adverse structural and functional outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Unfortunately, despite appropriate treatment, threshold ROP progresses to retinal detachment in 15 to 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This was the impetus for the Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity (ETROP) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], which ultimately led to the recommendation to treat the disease at an early stage. Treatment should be undertaken as soon as practicable, and generally should not be delayed beyond 72 hours following diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The benefits of retinal ablative therapy in infants with type I ROP were demonstrated in the ETROP trial, which included 317 infants with bilateral type I ROP (also called &quot;high-risk prethreshold ROP&quot;) randomly assigned to early treatment in one eye and conventional management in the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4,6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-10</a>]. Early treatment reduced unfavorable visual acuity (14.5 versus 19.5 percent) and unfavorable structural outcomes (9.1 versus 15.6 percent) at nine months corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. At age six years, early-treated eyes continued to have fewer unfavorable structural outcomes (8.9 versus 15.2 percent) and relatively preserved peripheral vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. At age six years, visual acuity outcomes were no longer statistically superior in the early treatment group (24.6 versus 29.0 percent unfavorable); however, in subgroup analysis, early treatment improved visual acuity outcome for &quot;higher-risk&quot; prethreshold eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The benefit of early treatment in the ETROP trial was largely driven by improved outcomes in zone I eyes (41 percent of the cohort). Thus, benefits are less well established for infants with borderline treatment indications (eg, zone II eyes starting to show signs of involution).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3375024034\"><span class=\"h3\">First-line therapies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1538776778\"><span class=\"h4\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laser photocoagulation is an established and effective treatment for ROP and has largely replaced cryotherapy as standard therapy. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">bevacizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a>) is emerging as an effective treatment for ROP and these agents are widely used as monotherapy throughout the world. (See <a href=\"#H2563445641\" class=\"local\">'Laser photocoagulation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2605989876\" class=\"local\">'Anti-VEGF therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Randomized controlled trials comparing laser photocoagulation and anti-VEGF therapy are limited by small sample size and relatively short follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Both therapies have advantages and disadvantages. There is more experience with laser therapy and therefore the expected effects (including short- and long-term outcomes and adverse events) are generally better established with this modality. The choice between the two approaches is largely based on the experience and preference of the treating ophthalmologist and the preferences of the patient's caregivers. Important considerations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity of disease &ndash; Laser therapy is an established therapy for type I ROP; whereas strict indications for anti-VEGF therapy are less well established.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ease of administration &ndash; Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents can be performed with topical anesthesia at the bedside, whereas laser photocoagulation requires more time, is typically more stressful to the infant, and is often performed under general anesthesia. Thus, in unstable infants, intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy may be preferred.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timing of response &ndash; ROP involution is generally more rapid with anti-VEGF therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term ocular outcomes &ndash; Long-term ocular outcomes, particularly the effects on visual acuity and visual fields, are not well-established with anti-VEGF therapy. The risk of myopia appears to be lower with anti-VEGF therapy, and theoretically anti-VEGF therapy may limit permanent visual field loss that can occur with peripheral ablative laser therapy; however, this has not been demonstrated in clinical studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential for systemic effects &ndash; This is potentially a concern with anti-VEGF therapy, though long-term data are not available. While there are no systemic events specifically related to laser photocoagulation, unwanted systemic events may occur due to the effects of general <span class=\"nowrap\">anesthesia/sedation</span> and stress associated with the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2563445641\"><span class=\"h4\">Laser photocoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laser photocoagulation, using the diode or argon laser is an established standard treatment for ROP. The laser, mounted on an indirect ophthalmoscope, is aimed through the pupil and focused on the avascular retina using a condensing lens like the one used for retinal viewing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> &ndash; The superior efficacy of laser photocoagulation compared with cryotherapy is supported by randomized controlled trials and observational studies that have demonstrated higher rates of resolution or regression of ROP, less retinal detachment, better visual acuity, and less myopia with laser therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Long-term results with laser therapy versus cryotherapy were described in two follow-up reports on 25 participants (44 eyes) in a randomized trial who were evaluated after 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Compared with cryotherapy, outcomes in the eyes treated with laser included:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Better mean best-corrected visual acuity <span class=\"nowrap\">(20/66</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">20/182</span> [Snellen equivalent])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Smaller likelihood of developing retinal dragging</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Less myopia, demonstrated by a lower mean spherical equivalent (-4.48 versus -7.65 diopters)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Greater mean axial length (22.9 versus 21.7 mm) and anterior chamber depth (3.42 versus 2.86 mm) and decreased lens thickness (3.95 versus 4.33 mm)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complications</strong> &ndash; Laser treatment is generally better tolerated than cryotherapy. Infants are less likely to have conjunctival chemosis, inflammation, pain, or apnea and bradycardia following the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cataracts may develop after laser treatment, but visually significant lens opacities appear to be rare. Cataracts may be less likely to occur following photocoagulation with a diode than argon laser. In one study of 293 eyes, no visually significant cataracts occurred after diode laser treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In contrast, cataracts formed in 1 to 6 percent of eyes following argon laser treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. A rare complication of laser treatment is angle-closure glaucoma seen two to five weeks after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

A single multicenter randomized trial suggests that bevacizumab is efficacious in the treatment of ROP prior to the onset of retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Anti-VEGF agents may be used as monotherapy or may be used in combination with laser therapy. Uncertainties remain regarding the long-term effect of anti-VEGF therapy on visual acuity and visual fields, the duration and frequency of follow-up, and the management of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/25,31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,31-36</a>].</p><p>Potential advantages of intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">bevacizumab</a> (IVB) over photocoagulation for the treatment of ROP include ease of administration (typically at the bedside under local anesthesia) and more rapid response (because it inactivates VEGF directly). In addition, IVB may be used in infants for whom photocoagulation is difficult or impossible (eg, those with opaque cornea or lens, vitreous haziness, poor pupillary dilation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,32</a>]. Potential disadvantages include the possibility of long-term systemic effects from temporarily suppressing serum VEGF levels, including potential damage to the brain, lungs, liver, and kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In addition, timing of the injection is important, since too early may interfere with normal retinal vascularization, and too late may hasten retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/25,32,33,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,32,33,39-41</a>]. The minimum effective dose has not yet been established, but it appears to be much less than the doses used in early reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].

IVB was associated with decreased rates of recurrence (6 versus 26 percent) and fewer structural abnormalities (eg, macular dragging, retinal detachment) at 54 weeks postmenstrual age. A significant treatment effect was observed in zone I eyes but not zone II eyes. No systemic or local toxic effects were observed; however, the study was too small to adequately assess ocular and systemic safety. Recurrence occurred later among infants treated with IVB than infants treated with laser therapy (mean of 16.0 versus 6.2 weeks after treatment), suggesting that infants treated with IVB may require prolonged follow-up. In a follow-up study of 109 infants enrolled in BEAT-ROP who were evaluated at a mean age of 2.5 years, very high myopia was observed less commonly in IVB-treated eyes compared with laser treatment (3 versus 42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Data from case reports and single institution case series also suggest a high rate of regression of ROP following treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">bevacizumab</a> or other anti-VEGF agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aflibercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aflibercept</a>, or conbercept) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/25,27-30,46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27-30,46-49</a>].

Cryotherapy was the only proven treatment for ROP until the early 1990s, but it has been largely replaced by laser photocoagulation due to improved outcomes with that modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity Cooperative Group (CRYO-ROP) trial demonstrated the efficacy of cryotherapy compared with no treatment for infants with threshold ROP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. Subsequent studies established that outcomes are improved if treatment is provided prior to progression to threshold ROP and that laser photocoagulation as a more effective therapy.

Regression may occur over several weeks with laser therapy, whereas the response is usually more rapid with anti-VEGF therapy. However, even if the ROP regresses, recurrences may occur. Some studies have reported recurrence in as many as one-quarter of treated patients. However, recurrence rates vary considerably depending on the timing of treatment, the laser treatment technique, the specific anti-VEGF agent and dose used, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the definition used to identify recurrence.</p><p>The BEAT-ROP trial found that recurrence is less common with IVB compared with laser therapy (6 versus 27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The timing of recurrence was later with IVB than with laser therapy (mean of 16 versus 6.2 weeks after treatment). In a subsequent report that included 241 infants treated with IVB monotherapy (including 75 infants from the BEAT-ROP trial and 166 infants not involved in the trial who were treated at one of the study institutions), recurrence was noted in 8 percent after a mean interval of 16.2 weeks following treatment, with the majority occurring at 45 to 55 weeks adjusted age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

The procedures typically used include scleral buckling or vitrectomy. In one series, these techniques resulted in light perception or better vision in 72 percent of eyes and achieved visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/300</span> or better in 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>With scleral buckling, a silicone band is placed around the eye and tightened so that the wall of the eye is reapposed to the retina, allowing reattachment to occur. Vitrectomy involves surgical removal of the vitreous, and excision of the fibrous tissue that is placing traction on the retina. Removal of the lens is sometimes required to allow surgical access to anterior disease. Upon removal of the vitreous and its associated traction, the retina may settle back into position, with resulting reattachment. Despite successful reattachment of the retina, patients who have detachments involving the fovea often have extremely poor vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/63-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-67</a>].</p><p>Predictors of retinal detachment after laser treatment for threshold ROP were identified in a retrospective case series of 262 eyes in 138 infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

Retinal detachment was more frequent in eyes with vitreous hemorrhage severe enough to completely obscure visualization of the retina and in eyes with clinically important vitreous organization. Vitreous organization was defined by the presence of white, fibrous-appearing opacification of the vitreous above the <span class=\"nowrap\">vascular/avascular</span> junction. It was considered clinically important when it spanned &ge;2 contiguous clock hours or was dense enough to moderately or severely reduce visualization of the retina, but also to have been unassociated with retinal detachment at the time of initial discovery. The development of retinal detachment was not associated with prolonged activity of stage 3 disease or plus disease more than 21 days after treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3264942291\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, follow-up examinations are required for infants who remain at risk for ROP progression and for infants with treated ROP who are at risk for recurrence. We typically see patients every one to two weeks initially, with less frequent evaluations as the clinical course improves.</p><p>Infants with ROP are at increased risk for developing myopia, astigmatism, anisometropia, and strabismus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>]. Infants and children with a history of severe ROP therefore may require regular follow-up with an ophthalmologist to monitor for long-term vision problems. The evaluation and management of refractive errors and strabismus in children are discussed separately.

The risk of visual impairment is greatest in children with severe ROP (ie, stage &ge;3). Poor visual acuity is rare when ROP is observed only in zone III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81495 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>The incidence of visual impairment due to ROP has decreased considerably since the 1990s, most likely as a result of improved screening for ROP and advances in treatment, including laser photocoagulation and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In a retrospective study, the incidence of complete blindness due to ROP decreased from 27.5 percent in the period from 1994 to 2000 to 7.1 percent in the period from 2000 to 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Similarly, in another retrospective cohort study, the incidence of visual impairment from ROP fell from 26 percent in the period from 1991 to 2004 to 7.3 percent in the period from 2005 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. During this same period, rates of detection of ROP increased substantially, which suggests that the improved outcomes are due to improvements in treatment rather than prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>Severe ROP is also a predictor of nonvisual functional disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. In a cohort study of 1582 preterm infants with birth weights &le;1250 g born between 1999 and 2004 and followed up at age five years, 40 percent of children with severe ROP had at least one nonvisual disability compared with 16 percent of children without severe ROP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Motor impairment, cognitive impairment, and severe hearing loss were 3 to 4 times more common in children with severe ROP than those without. Long-term complications of prematurity are discussed in greater detail separately.

In addition, episodes of physiologic instability that may increase the risk of ROP should be avoided if possible. Breast milk feeding appears to play a protective role in preventing ROP and should be encouraged for this benefit and because of other well-established benefits of breast milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>].

In the STOP-ROP trial, 649 infants with prethreshold ROP were randomly assigned to maintain oxygen saturation at 96 to 99 (supplemental) or 89 to 94 (conventional) percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The rate of progression to threshold was lower in the supplemental oxygen group, but the finding did not reach statistical significance (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% CI 0.52-1.01). Supplemental oxygen did not reduce the number of infants requiring peripheral ablative surgery. Further analysis suggested that the treatment may be more effective in infants without plus disease (32 versus 46 percent rate of progression). However, adverse pulmonary effects occurred more frequently in the supplemental oxygen group. Treated infants were more likely to have pneumonia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exacerbations of chronic lung disease (13.2 versus 8.5 percent) and to remain hospitalized, on oxygen, and on diuretics at 50 postmenstrual weeks. Thus, if there is a beneficial effect of supplemental oxygen on ROP, it appears to be small and the risk of adverse events likely outweighs any benefits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, efforts to prevent ROP by avoiding high oxygen levels have also been unrewarding. In a 2015 meta-analysis that included data from five randomized trials comparing restricted oxygen therapy (target oxygen saturation 85 to 89 percent) and liberal oxygen therapy (target oxygen saturation 91 to 95 percent), the restrictive strategy was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in ROP (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.50-1.04; three trials), but an increased risk of in-hospital mortality (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.03-1.36; two trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. There was no difference in mortality or severe disability at 18 to 24 months (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.92-1.14; four trials). In a subsequent meta-analysis that included observational studies and clinical trials, lower oxygen saturation target was associated with a lower risk of developing ROP (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77-0.97) but an increased risk of mortality (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.04-1.29) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. </p><p/><p>The optimal target for oxygen saturation in extremely preterm infants remains uncertain.

It is a common cause of potentially preventable childhood blindness in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H2598817879\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinopathy of prematurity: Pathogenesis, epidemiology, classification, and screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for ROP is based on disease severity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81495 \">figure 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H1125574223\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with type I ROP or more severe disease, we recommend treatment rather than ongoing surveillance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Effective treatments for ROP include laser photocoagulation and intravitreal injection of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">bevacizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aflibercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aflibercept</a>). The choice of therapy depends upon the severity of ROP, medical condition of the infant, experience and preference of the treating ophthalmologist, and the preferences of the patient's caregivers. (See <a href=\"#H3375024034\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with ROP who do not meet criteria for type I ROP, we suggest ongoing surveillance rather than providing specific ROP therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). These infants should be monitored until the criteria for discontinuation of screening have been met. (See <a href=\"#H1989284658\" class=\"local\">'Less severe ROP'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinopathy of prematurity: Pathogenesis, epidemiology, classification, and screening&quot;, section on 'Discontinuation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy with laser photocoagulation or intravitreal anti-VEGF injection results in regression of ROP in the majority of treated patients. Regression may occur over several weeks with laser therapy, whereas the response is usually more rapid with anti-VEGF therapy. However, even if the ROP regresses, recurrences may occur. For patients who fail to achieve ROP regression with the initial therapy and for those in whom vision-threatening ROP recurs, further therapy may consist of a second treatment using the same modality or may involve using a different modality. (See <a href=\"#H2131827883\" class=\"local\">'Treatment failure and recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When ROP progresses to partial or total retinal detachment (stage 4 or 5), surgical intervention may be attempted to prevent progression, promote reattachment of the retina, and preserve vision. (See <a href=\"#H3723227765\" class=\"local\">'Retinal detachment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After treatment, follow-up examinations are required for infants who remain at risk for ROP progression and for infants with treated ROP who are at risk for recurrence.

The risk of visual impairment is greatest in children with severe ROP (ie, stage &ge;3). The incidence of visual impairment due to ROP is decreasing, most likely as a result of advances in treatment of severe disease.
