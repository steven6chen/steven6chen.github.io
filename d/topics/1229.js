Although <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia (PCP) remains the most common AIDS-defining opportunistic infection in the United States, its incidence has decreased with improved prophylactic and antiretroviral therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of Pneumocystis pulmonary infection in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HIV-infected patients are at risk for a number of other pulmonary infections in addition to PCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Bacterial pneumonia remains a common complication in HIV-infected patients, and has increased as a proportion of diagnosed pulmonary infections despite an overall decrease in the number of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A detailed discussion of bacterial pulmonary infections in HIV-infected patients is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial pulmonary infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to bacterial pneumonia, millions of people are infected with both HIV and tuberculosis (TB), especially in developing countries. In Africa, TB is the most common pulmonary complication of HIV, and at least one-third of all cases occur in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Viral pathogens also contribute to the burden of pulmonary disease in patients infected with HIV. The clinical significance of isolating cytomegalovirus (CMV) from respiratory secretions is an area of particular controversy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

As an example, the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) has declined, most likely as a result of immune reconstitution (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection and malignancy: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite these improvements associated with ART, noninfectious pulmonary diseases, including lung cancer and emphysema, are associated with HIV infection. In addition, organizing pneumonia, sarcoidosis, drug hypersensitivity, primary effusion lymphoma, foreign body granulomatosis, and other forms of lung disease can occasionally develop in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms/abstract/17-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-26</a>]. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, a rare interstitial lung disease in the general population, is seen with increased frequency in HIV-infected individuals, particularly children. The immune reconstitution syndrome can also affect the lung and mimic other conditions such as various infections and even lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

By contrast, vaccination with pneumococcal vaccine did not appear to reduce this risk, at least in the era prior to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Many cases of TB in HIV-infected patients represent newly acquired infection, rather than reactivation of old disease. Healthcare facilities, prisons, and homeless shelters are potential sources for transmission of TB. TB may accelerate the course of HIV disease since its occurrence is one factor predicting the development of subsequent OIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is an increased incidence of pulmonary histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis in patients who live or travel in endemic areas (the Mississippi River Valley and the Southwest United States, respectively). Reactivation can occur especially in histoplasmosis; thus, patients who resided or spent time in endemic areas earlier in their lives are at risk for overt disease, as they become more immunosuppressed.</p><p>In addition to infection caused by endemic fungi, parasitic disease results in substantial morbidity and mortality among this population worldwide. Responsible organisms include Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Cryptosporidium, and Microsporidium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasma-pneumonia-and-other-parasitic-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasma pneumonia and other parasitic pulmonary infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients receiving ART may develop recrudescence of diseases that have been dormant.

The sequence of pulmonary infections occurring in HIV-infected individuals parallels the depletion of CD4 lymphocytes. As a result, the CD4 count (or the &quot;stage&quot; of HIV) can provide information about the type of pulmonary disease to which the patient is susceptible. The stages of HIV are defined by the CD4 count. These include early (CD4 &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL),</span> intermediate (CD4 200 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL),</span> advanced (CD4 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL),</span> and late-stage disease (CD4 &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span>.

A diagnostic algorithm for the evaluation of HIV-infected patients with pulmonary symptoms, including options for empiric therapy and definitive diagnosis, is recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78591\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78591 \">figure 1</a>).</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Jones JL, Hanson DL, Dworkin MS, et al.
