Although the most marked change is a reversal in the ratio of squamous cell cancers to adenocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], there has also been a shift in stage distribution. The incidence of superficial esophageal cancer (invading no deeper than the submucosa) is increasing, particularly in Asian countries where screening for upper digestive tract cancers is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. A similar trend has been seen in the United States and attributed, at least in part, to routine endoscopic surveillance for malignancy and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in patients with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of longstanding gastroesophageal reflux disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Pathogenesis and malignant transformation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathobiology of esophageal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For many years, the standard treatment for both HGD and superficial esophageal cancer has been esophagectomy. High cure rates were achieved but at the cost of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic approaches to definitive therapy (eg, endoscopic resection [ER], photodynamic therapy [PDT], laser therapy, and argon plasma coagulation [APC]) have increasingly been used in this country following encouraging early reports from Japan and Europe. However, these techniques are only appropriate for patients who have a very low risk of lymph node metastases or who are poor candidates for esophageal surgery.</p><p>This topic review will focus on treatment strategies for superficial esophageal cancer. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer; surgical techniques for esophagectomy; and combined modality approaches for the treatment of muscle-invasive disease are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Submucosal involvement is the most important prognostic determinant for early esophageal cancers because the presence of lymphatic vessels within the submucosa facilitates dissemination of cancer cells. Thus an accurate assessment of tumor extent, often with the utilization of high frequency endoscopic ultrasound, is needed to direct therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic subclassification and the risk of nodal metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early esophageal cancers are those that are classified as Tis (high-grade dysplasia, which includes all noninvasive neoplastic epithelial that was formerly called carcinoma in situ) or T1 tumors, which are split into T1a and T1b subcategories depending on the depth of invasion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The risk of nodal metastases is higher for T1b than for T1a tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In one series, of 3963 patients derived from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) who were treated surgically for localized esophageal cancer, the risk of nodal metastases for T1a and T1b tumors was 5 versus 16.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>However, this classification by itself is inadequate to distinguish clinically meaningful differences in lymph node involvement among T1a versus T1b esophageal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There are two main strategies to further refine the assessment of nodal involvement: subclassification of tumor (T) status, and use of pathologic factors other than depth of invasion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H872486681\"><span class=\"h3\">More comprehensive T stage subclassification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A more comprehensive subclassification scheme has been proposed by Japanese investigators for early esophageal cancers and is useful for determining prognosis and selecting treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64349\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64349 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. According to this classification, mucosal tumors are divided into three types based upon the depth of invasion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M1 &ndash; Limited to the epithelial layer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M2 &ndash; Invades the lamina propria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M3 &ndash; Invades into but not through the muscularis mucosa</p><p/><p>M1 tumors correspond to the Tis stage in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage definition, while M2 and M3 tumors would be considered T1a lesions.</p><p>Tumors invading the submucosa are subclassified as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SM1 &ndash; Penetrates the shallowest one-third of the submucosa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SM2 &ndash; Penetrates into the intermediate one-third of the submucosa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SM3 &ndash; Penetrates the deepest one-third of the submucosa</p><p/><p>All of these subcategories would be considered T1b disease according to the AJCC stage definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The incidence of lymph node metastases in published series of patients with early esophageal cancer, stratified according to depth of invasion, is summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64478\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64478 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/12,13,15-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,15-22</a>]. The following conclusions can be drawn from these data:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there are fewer data on superficial adenocarcinomas, rates of nodal metastases are no higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] than with squamous cell cancers, which have been more extensively investigated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M1 and M2 tumors are not associated with lymph node metastases and hence are well suited to endoscopic treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of nodal metastases with M3 tumors is zero in many studies, but as high as 12 percent in others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64478\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64478 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients with evidence of lymphovascular invasion are the most likely to harbor lymph node metastases:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a report of 464 consecutive patients with superficial esophageal cancer who underwent radical esophagectomy with node dissection, only four of the 38 patients with M3 lesions and no lymphatic invasion had lymph node metastases, whereas five of the 12 patients with lymphatic invasion were found to have nodal metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a second report of 402 patients with superficial squamous cell esophageal cancer, the cumulative five-year metastasis rate (both lymphatic and distant) in patients with M3 cancers was 8.7 percent; among patients with mucosal cancer (M1, 2, or 3), the five-year rate of metastases with and without lymphovascular invasion was 47 versus 0.7 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Thus, for patients with M3 tumors without evidence of lymphovascular invasion, endoscopic therapy is also a reasonable strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All submucosal tumors have a substantial risk of lymph node metastases. Endoscopic mucosal resection should be avoided in these patients, as it exposes the patients to an unacceptably high risk of both local and distant recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], although this has not been seen in all series, particularly when patients were carefully selected for shallow invasion into the submucosa and otherwise favorable histologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In our view, esophagectomy with therapeutic lymphadenectomy provides the greatest chance for potentially curative therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Esophagectomy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Most centers are not using this Japanese classification and instead rely on the AJCC T1a versus T1b classification scheme for superficial esophageal cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H872486694\"><span class=\"h3\">Other features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to depth of invasion, other tumor features that may impact on the risk of lymph node metastases are macroscopic appearance of the lesion (flat-type versus non-flat [elevated, depressed, or ulcerated]), tumor size, the presence of lymphovascular invasion, and possibly histologic grade of differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/10,13,15,22,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,15,22,29-31</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Shimada series described above, the risk of positive nodes was significantly higher for non-flat type lesions as compared with flat-type lesions (37 versus 17 percent, respectively), while it was no different among patients with histologically poorly-differentiated versus differentiated lesions (31 and 39 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Tumors with lymphatic invasion also had a higher rate of nodal metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the other hand, in the NCDB series described above, predictors of nodal metastases other than depth of invasion included tumor size &gt;2 cm and <span class=\"nowrap\">intermediate/high-grade</span> (versus low-grade) lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As an example, 0.5 percent of low-grade T1a lesions &lt;2 cm had nodal metastases. Among T1b tumors, 17 percent of all patients had at least one positive node, which decreased to 8.9 percent for low-grade lesions &lt;2 cm.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Accuracy of EUS in the staging evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the depth of invasion is an important indicator of the risk for nodal metastases in patients with superficial esophageal cancer. At present, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the most accurate noninvasive method to assess depth of invasion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73301\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73301 \">image 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-anatomy-of-the-normal-esophagus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound: Anatomy of the normal esophagus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in esophageal carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The accuracy of EUS for T staging of superficial tumors has been controversial. While an earlier meta-analysis suggested that EUS may not be as accurate for T staging in patients with early esophageal cancer compared with those with more advanced tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], a subsequent larger meta-analysis found that EUS was accurate for staging T1a and T1b tumors, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93 to 0.96 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>If the EUS identifies esophageal cancer that invades the muscularis mucosa or if there is evidence of lymph node involvement, then surgical therapy is often recommended. On the other hand, if the EUS identifies only mucosal disease and the patient is potentially eligible for endoscopic treatment, an endoscopic resection is then performed to precisely define the depth of invasion. The pathology result from the endoscopic resection (particularly the presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion) can be used to guide the final decision as to whether endoscopic therapy alone is sufficient or if surgery should be recommended.</p><p>This approach has been questioned by some who suggest that EUS should not be used to determine which patients should go to surgery and that instead all patients with an apparently superficial esophageal cancer should undergo careful endoscopic examination with endoscopic resection (ER) without EUS. This position is supported by a retrospective study that included 131 patients with early esophageal or cardia neoplasia (primarily adenocarcinoma arising from Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. All patients underwent EUS and ER for staging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>EUS findings were suggestive of submucosal invasion or lymph node metastases in 26 patients (20 percent). Of note, EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was undertaken in 6 of 12 patients with suspicious lymph nodes, none of whom were shown to have spread from the esophageal cancer. In 10 of the 26 patients with an abnormal EUS, the ER specimen did not show risk factors for lymph node metastases (ie, submucosal invasion [or T1m3 cancer for patients with squamous cell dysplasia], poorly-differentiated cancer, lymphovascular infiltration, or tumor involvement at the deep resection margin). Surgical resection was not performed, and no patient developed recurrent neoplasia during follow-up (median 30 to 42 months).</p><p>Among the 105 patients with normal EUS findings (ie, no suspicion of deep mucosal invasion or lymphadenopathy), 25 (24 percent) had ER specimens that showed risk factors for lymph node metastases. Subsequent surgery showed 19 patients with submucosal invasion and six with high-grade histology or vascular infiltration.</p><p>Based upon these findings, the authors concluded that EUS findings have no clinical impact on the workup of early esophageal neoplasia and that EUS findings alone are not sufficient to refer a patient for surgery without confirmation by ER.</p><p>Given that ER provides more precise histologic staging, EUS appears to be of diminishing importance in the diagnostic workup of a superficial esophageal cancer, except to exclude that there is not deeper involvement (ie, T3 or T4 disease) or lymph nodes. Upfront EUS may not be necessary if endoscopic inspection suggests that ER is feasible. If a diagnostic ER confirms a low-risk neoplasm, the additional impact of EUS is questionable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ESOPHAGECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophagectomy is the treatment of choice for fit patients with superficial esophageal cancers invading the submucosa (T1b) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64349\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64349 \">figure 1</a>). Although the preferred treatment for intramucosal superficial cancers has previously been surgery, endoscopic resection is our preferred approach for patients with M1 and M2 tumors, as well as those with well-differentiated M3 disease without lymphovascular invasion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64349\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64349 \">figure 1</a>). Esophagectomy is still preferred for patients with intramucosal M3 carcinomas with lymphovascular invasion. In addition, we still do esophagectomy for persistent positive margins after endoscopic therapy, recurrences that cannot be endoscopically treated, long segment lesions not amenable to endoscopic therapy, and rarely, for patient preference. Because outcomes are directly related to surgeon as well as institutional experience, patients needing esophagectomy should be referred to a high-volume center that specializes in esophageal cancer care.</p><p>Prior to the emergence of endoscopic techniques, esophagectomy was the treatment of choice for superficial esophageal cancers. The potential advantages of esophagectomy include precise pathologic staging information, the permanent removal of all Barrett's mucosa at risk to develop a malignant focus, and treatment is definitive, without the need for posttreatment surveillance or salvage therapy in the event of a recurrence. Among the disadvantages are an average 10-day hospital stay, a substantial risk of major complications, a small but real risk of perioperative death (approximately 2 percent in high-volume centers, see below), a recovery period that can take several months, and the potential for long-term problems with swallowing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">The volume-performance relationship</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, esophagectomy was associated with perioperative morbidity and mortality rates that were among the highest of all standard cancer operations as well as other major procedures such as cardiac or vascular surgery. As such, it earned a reputation as high-risk surgery, prompting reluctance on the part of physicians to refer patients for resection, particularly if they had early-stage disease.</p><p>However, patients who undergo esophagectomy by experienced surgeons at hospitals that perform large numbers of procedures have lower perioperative mortality rates and better early clinical outcomes than those who undergo resection at lower-volume institutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/35-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-43</a>]. In the most often-quoted study on the volume-performance relationship for esophagectomy, the Medicare claims database for 1998 and 1999 was analyzed to determine the relationship between surgeon and hospital volume and operative mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In general, these were elderly patients with significant comorbidity and usually advanced disease. Perioperative mortality rates were significantly related to surgeon volume: They were 19, 13, and 9 percent for surgeons performing fewer than two, between two and six, and more than six esophagectomies per year, respectively (p&lt;0.001). This effect held true even among low-volume surgeons working in high-volume hospitals.</p><p>There was also a significant correlation between hospital volume and perioperative mortality. When compared with the lowest volume hospitals (fewer than two procedures annually), the adjusted odds ratio for mortality for patients treated at the highest volume hospitals (more than 19 procedures annually) was 0.36 (95% CI 0.26-0.50). A second series found that high-volume hospitals were able to reduce their esophagectomy-related mortality over time (from 11 to 7.5 percent, p = 0.003), presumably from increasing experience with the procedure, while low-volume hospitals could not (procedure-related mortality rates were 15.3 versus 14.5 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Other reports document lower complication rates in high-volume hospitals and more successful management of complications compared with low-volume hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis sought to define the number of esophagectomies needed for a center to achieve an acceptably low mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Hospitals that performed more than 20 resections per year had a perioperative mortality rate of only 4.9 percent, and the odds ratio of death for hospitals performing more than 20 resections per year compared with a lesser number was 0.43 (95% CI 0.31-0.58). Thus, a minimum of 20 esophagectomies per year has become a benchmark, with most large high-volume centers now reporting perioperative mortality rates in the range of 1 to 4 percent.</p><p>In summary, the weight of evidence supports the view that &quot;practice makes perfect&quot; in this high-risk, demanding operation. As such, the optimal management strategy is to refer patients needing esophagectomy to a high-volume center that specializes in esophageal cancer care. Nevertheless, a large proportion of esophagectomies in the United States are still performed in low-volume centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several published reports detail outcomes from esophagectomy for superficial esophageal cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59698 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/2,11,12,15-17,44-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,12,15-17,44-51</a>]. However, interpretation of these data is limited by high perioperative morbidity and mortality rates in many series, attributable both to the long time period over which cases were collected and to the volume-performance issues discussed above. Nonetheless, these reports provide an approximation of expected outcomes after esophagectomy in patients with superficial cancers. The following conclusions can be drawn:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Results are much better than standard surgical series of esophagectomy for muscle-invasive cancers, where three to five-year survival rates are 25 to 30 percent. Likewise, recurrence rates are relatively low, with most patients dying of other causes, again unlike standard surgical series. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of resectable esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a clear difference in outcomes when mucosal and submucosal cancers are compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/17,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,52</a>]. This is best illustrated by the series by Westerterp and colleagues which analyzed recurrence-free survival according to depth of invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There was only one local recurrence among 79 patients with M1, M2, M3, or SM1 tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64349\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64349 \">figure 1</a>) (five-year recurrence-free survival 97 percent). Recurrence rates were higher among those with SM2 and SM3 tumors (8 of 41 patients, five-year recurrence-free survival 57 percent). In this series, 19 patients already had nodal metastases at the time the superficial cancer was diagnosed; their outcomes were significantly worse after resection than those for patients without nodal metastases (five-year recurrence-free survival 33 versus 94 percent).</p><p/><p>Additional information can be derived from series of patients undergoing esophagectomy for a biopsy diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia ([HGD] sometimes called high-grade esophageal intraepithelial neoplasia [HGIN]) in the setting of Barrett's esophagus. Typically, these patients (largely in the past) have not had endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or endoscopic resection (ER), so they are often understaged. The high incidence of finding invasive cancer in the resected specimen (approximately 40 percent) has led many surgeons to recommend esophagectomy for fit patients with a diagnosis of HGD, although others suggest endoscopic surveillance every three months until invasive cancer is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/44,46-48,53-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46-48,53-57</a>]. A modern approach is that a biopsy diagnosis of HGD typically leads to endoscopic staging with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) with or without EUS, and a consideration of endoscopic therapy alone if HGD or a T1a lesion is confirmed and complete eradication is thought to be possible.

The first is endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), which involves snare resection of dysplastic lesion. The second is endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), in which endoscopic tools are used to dissect lesions from the submucosa. Lesions larger than 2 cm are difficult to treat with EMR since piecemeal resection is often necessary, which requires a higher level of endoscopic expertise, increases the chances of complications, and often makes it impossible to be conclusive about the completeness of the resection at the lateral margins. The technique of ESD can remove larger lesions intact, but expertise in this technique in the esophagus is not widely available.

Most were treated with ER alone (n = 279), but others received PDT (n = 55), both ER and PDT (n = 13), or APC (n = 2). At a mean follow-up of 63.1 months, a complete response was found in 96.6 percent (n = 337) of treated patients. Surgery was needed in only 3.7 percent after endoscopic therapy failed.

The pooled complete (R0) resection rate was 90 percent (95% CI 87-94 percent) while for large tumors (diameter more than 25 mm) it was 85 percent (95% CI 80-90 percent). The most common complications of ESD were esophageal stenosis (5 percent; 95% CI 3-8 percent) and perforation (1 percent, 95% CI 0-1 percent).

The review included 742 patients diagnosed with Tis or T1 nonsquamous and squamous cell-type esophageal cancer between 1998 and 2003, and reported to the SEER registry. Endoscopic treatment (ER alone in two-thirds) was given to 99 patients (13 percent), while the remainder (n = 643) were managed by surgical resection. In a Cox proportional hazards model, the relative hazard for esophageal cancer-specific mortality in the patients treated by endoscopic therapy was no different from the surgical group (relative hazard 0.89, 95% CI 0.51-1.56, p = 0.68).</p><p>On the other hand, a higher long-term mortality rate for endoscopic therapy was suggested in a report derived from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), which included 5390 patients from 824 hospitals who underwent treatment for a T1a (54 percent) or T1b (46 percent) esophageal cancer from 2004 to 2010; 3963 had surgical resection and the remainder were treated endoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

It should be noted however, that a substantial number of patients with T1b tumors were treated endoscopically (rates of ER for T1b tumors increased from 6.6 percent in 2004 to 21 percent in 2010), and patient selection could have accounted for these findings.</p><p>Complications of ER include acute perforations and bleeding, and delayed esophageal strictures.

At least in the United States, this has been attributed, at least in part, to routine endoscopic surveillance for malignancy and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in patients with Barrett's esophagus. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two major treatment options for early esophageal cancer are surgical esophagectomy and endoscopic resection (ER). It is important to balance the risk of nodal metastases and procedural risk when counseling patients regarding their treatment options:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The depth of tumor invasion into the wall of the esophagus is an important factor in selecting treatment. If the patient is a candidate for endoscopic therapy, we suggest a diagnostic (and potentially therapeutic) ER to more accurately define the depth of invasion. The presence of submucosal invasion or muscularis mucosa invasion (ie, M3 tumors) with lymphovascular invasion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64349\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64349 \">figure 1</a>) increases the risk for lymph node metastases, and these patients are not good candidates for endoscopic therapy alone. Furthermore, if a diagnostic ER is not feasible because of poor lifting or an inability to suction the lesion into the endoscopic resection cap, both possible signs of submucosal growth, patients should be referred for surgery. The contribution of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for tumor staging and treatment decision-making is controversial, although may be of most value in excluding more advanced disease than clinically suspected. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Accuracy of EUS in the staging evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic subclassification and the risk of nodal metastases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other factors to consider in the selection of endoscopic versus surgical treatment are the size of the lesion, the macroscopic endoscopic appearance (flat versus non-flat), the presence of lymphovascular invasion, histologic grade of differentiation, the presence and extent of Barrett's mucosa, other esophageal pathology (particularly varices), comorbid medical conditions, the age of the patient, the availability of the various treatments in a particular center, and the desire of the patient for endoscopic therapy. Regardless of the approach chosen, patients with superficial esophageal cancer are best treated in high volume centers that specialize in treatment of esophageal cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following represents our general approach to treating superficial esophageal cancer:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For fit patients with submucosal (T1b) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a>) cancer, we recommend esophagectomy over ER, which will maximize the chance for cure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Esophagectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with M1 and M2 tumors, as well as those with well-differentiated M3 disease without lymphovascular invasion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64349\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64349 \">figure 1</a>), esophagectomy represents the most definitive approach, but ER is a valid alternative if performed at institutions with expertise in this technique. For most patients who have favorable mucosal tumors, who are interested in an esophagus-sparing approach or are elderly with multiple comorbidities or otherwise high surgical risk, and who are treated at institutions with expertise in this technique, we suggest ER rather than surgical resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic resection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H872486681\" class=\"local\">'More comprehensive T stage subclassification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For fit patients with M3 disease and lymphatic invasion, we suggest esophagectomy rather than endoscopic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For poorer risk patients with M3 disease and lymphatic invasion ER may be used along with PDT or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management#H66920267\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;, section on 'High-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Other indications for esophagectomy include persistent positive margins after endoscopic therapy, recurrences that cannot be endoscopically treated, long segment intramucosal lesions not amenable to endoscopic therapy, and rarely, for patient preference. Because outcomes are directly related to surgeon as well as institutional experience, patients needing esophagectomy should be referred to a high-volume center that specializes in esophageal cancer care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We reserve radiation therapy (RT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemoradiotherapy for patients with superficial esophageal cancer who are candidates for ER alone but who are ineligible for endoscopic therapy (eg, because of the presence of varices, previous perforation, severe cervical spine disease), and for those unwilling to travel to centers of excellence for treatment who can undergo RT close to home. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Radiation with or without chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The importance of prolonged follow-up in patients treated with an endoscopic approach cannot be overemphasized, as late recurrences may develop. These recurrences can usually be effectively treated if detected at an early stage.
