It can cause pain, numbness, or tingling down one or both legs.</p><p>To understand what a herniated disc is and how it causes symptoms, it's helpful to first learn a little about the back and spine.</p><p>The back is made up of (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56246 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertebrae &ndash; A stack of bones that sit on top of one another like a stack of coins. Each of these bones has a hole in the center. When stacked, the bones form a hollow tube that protects the spinal cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal cord and nerves &ndash; The spinal cord is the highway of nerves that connects the brain to the rest of the body. It runs through the vertebrae. Nerves branch from the spinal cord and pass in between the vertebrae. From there they connect to the arms, the legs, and the organs. (This is why problems in the back can cause leg pain or bladder problems.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discs &ndash; Rubbery discs sit in between each of the vertebrae to add cushion and allow movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscles, tendons, and ligaments &ndash; Together the muscles, tendons, and ligaments are called the &quot;soft tissues&quot; of the back. These soft tissues support the back and help hold it together.</p><p/><p>The discs that sit between the vertebrae have a tough outer shell and jelly-like center. The outer shell of the discs can sometimes break open, spilling the jelly material inside. This is what doctors call a herniated disc.</p><p>Herniated discs can cause symptoms, because the jelly material that spills out of them can irritate nearby nerves. Plus, the disc itself can bulge and press on nerves.</p><p>This article will discuss herniated discs only in the lower back. Other parts of the back can have herniated discs, but that is less common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8705887\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a herniated disc in the lower back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Herniated discs do not always cause symptoms. When they do, the most common symptom is tingling, pain, or numbness that spreads down one leg. These symptoms affect different parts of the leg, depending on which disc in the lower back is herniated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8705902\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. There are tests that can check for a herniated disc, but most people do not need them. That's because many people who have symptoms of a herniated disc get better on their own, regardless of what that test shows.</p><p>Imaging tests, such as an MRI or a CT scan, can show what the tissues inside the back look like. These tests can find a herniated disc if one is there. But doctors do not usually offer this test until a person has had symptoms for at least 4 to 6 weeks. In most cases, it does not make sense to order the test sooner, because the treatment for herniated disc during those first few weeks is the same no matter what an imaging test might show.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8705917\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New back pain that goes down into the groin or leg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back or leg pain along with leg weakness or problems controlling your bowels or bladder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A problem called &quot;foot drop,&quot; which is when you cannot seem to hold your foot up, for example, while walking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back or leg pain along with a fever or other symptoms that worry you</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8705932\"><span class=\"h1\">How is herniated disc treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small number of people end up needing surgery to treat a herniated disc. But most people do well with simpler treatments, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain medicines that you can get without a prescription. (If these do not work, doctors and nurses can prescribe stronger pain medicines.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to relax the muscles (called muscle relaxants)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injections of medicines that numb the back or reduce swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy to teach you special exercises and stretches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal manipulation, which is when someone like a physical therapist or a chiropractor moves or &quot;adjusts&quot; the joints of your back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acupuncture, which is when someone who knows traditional Chinese medicine inserts tiny needles into your body to block pain signals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massage</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8705947\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if surgery is right for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will tell you if surgery could help you. Then the two of you can decide together if surgery is right for you.</p><p>Surgery to treat a herniated disc involves exposing the spine and removing the disc that is damaged. It could help you feel better faster than you would without surgery. But, like any surgery, it also comes with risks.</p><p>Although surgery can speed up recovery, it is not usually necessary for a herniated disc. That's because over time the body absorbs the jelly from a damaged disc and heals in its own. But this can take months.</p><p>People who have a lot of discomfort or who want to get better fast, sometimes choose surgery. People who are afraid of surgery or who feel like they can cope with their symptoms sometimes decide against surgery.</p><p>If your doctor suggests surgery to treat a herniated disc, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How likely is it that surgery will help my symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How quickly will I recover from surgery?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks of surgery?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have surgery?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8705962\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. One of the most important things you can do to feel better is to stay as active as possible. Even if you have some pain or discomfort, you should not stay in bed or rest too long.</p><p>People used to think that bedrest was the best thing for an injured back. The truth is, bedrest can actually make back problems worse. That's because the back can get weak and stiff with too much rest.</p><p>Do not worry that you will do yourself harm by being active. It might hurt a bit more when you move around, but activity will do you good.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8705977\"><span class=\"h1\">Can herniated discs be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. People sometimes think that they got a herniated disc, because they lifted something the wrong way or strained their back somehow. The truth is, there is not much proof that moving or lifting the wrong way can cause a herniated disc.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8705992\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-stenosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Spinal stenosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cauda-equina-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cauda equina syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=do-i-need-an-x-ray-or-other-test-for-low-back-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Do I need an X-ray (or other test) for low back pain?
