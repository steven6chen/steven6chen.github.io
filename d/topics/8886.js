Dame Cecily Saunders, founder of the hospice and palliative care movements, recognized these four distinct yet intertwined domains in defining the concept of &quot;total pain&quot; in the 1960s, a holistic and enduring framework to guide the care of seriously ill persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>The relationship between spirituality and health has gained increased attention over the last two decades in the United States and elsewhere. Spirituality (which includes religious and existential aspects of care) is one of eight specific domains of quality within palliative care, endorsed by the National Consensus Project (NCP) for Quality Palliative Care and international palliative care organizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. However, spirituality has historically been one of the least studied and addressed domains within the care of the seriously ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. A growing body of literature supports the notion that spiritual care is an important patient need in palliative care, that spiritual distress is a significant component of overall distress in palliative care patients, and that patients' spirituality affects healthcare decision making and healthcare outcomes, including coping, quality of life, and pain management.<sup> </sup></p><p>This topic will review the available evidence linking spirituality and palliative care outcomes. An overview of spirituality in palliative care, which includes how to address spirituality with patients, methods of spiritual assessment, taking of a spiritual history, and approaches to spiritual distress, are addressed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of spirituality in palliative care&quot;</a>.) &#160; &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88594268\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spirituality</strong> is multidimensional and highly variable in its individual <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> communal experiences and expressions. It is often understood as encompassing the relationship to and experience of transcendence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] or sense of peace, purpose, and interconnectedness, including beliefs about the meaning of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. <br/><br/>Because of the need to standardize a definition for spirituality in palliative care, a group of interdisciplinary experts in palliative and spiritual care produced a consensus definition of spirituality as the aspect of humanity that refers to the way individuals seek and express meaning and purpose, and the way they experience their connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to the significant or sacred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Spirituality may include religion and other worldviews but encompasses far more general ways in which these experiences are expressed, including through the arts, relationships with nature and others, and for some, through the concept of secular humanism, the latter of which emphasizes reason, scientific inquiry, individual freedom and responsibility, human values, compassion, and the needs for tolerance and cooperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Religion</strong> is a structure through which a person or group of persons expresses spirituality within a community. A religious community is one that is organized around common beliefs, attitudes, practices, traditions, and relationships. </p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22162301\"><span class=\"h1\">SPIRITUAL DOMAINS AS FUNCTIONAL STATES AND AS OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Religion and spirituality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] play a multidimensional role for patients and families in the setting of serious illness. The most frequently explored spirituality domains in palliative care include the spiritual needs of patients and caregivers, the importance of spirituality, spiritual experience and religiousness (eg, religion, religious affiliation, positive and negative religious coping) to medical decision-making, coping strategies, and quality of life for <span class=\"nowrap\">patients/caregivers;</span> and the impact of spiritual practices (eg, prayer or meditation) on outcomes for patients with a serious or life-threatening illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/5,6,12-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,12-35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H88596399\" class=\"local\">'Influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p>Evaluating research exploring the impact of spirituality on outcomes in palliative care requires a framework of specific spiritual domains being assessed (independent predictors) as well as the outcomes being examined (dependent variables). Spiritual predictor variables generally include spiritual functional states such as religious coping or spiritual practices. Dependent variables can include a variety of outcomes that are hypothesized to be influenced by such spiritual predictors, eg, quality of life, medical decision-making at the end of life. Outcomes may also include specific spiritual dependent variables, such as spiritual well-being, a domain of patient quality of life (often conceptualized as multidimensional, with domains including meaning, peace, and faith [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]) or the outcome of spiritual distress (sometimes termed &quot;spiritual pain&quot;). Although spiritual outcome variables can be conceptualized as outcome predictors (eg, examining the relationship of spiritual well-being or distress to medical decision-making), care should be taken in outcomes research to clearly define the conceptual model, such as when examining spiritual well-being as a predictor of patient quality of life, given the conceptual overlap between these constructs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. &#160;</p><p>In addition to considering the diversity of spiritual variables and their relationships to outcomes in serious illness, there are many potential persons influencing patient and family outcomes (the patients themselves, family, their faith community, and medical caregivers) that need to be considered in research examining the link between spirituality and outcomes in palliative care patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F104559\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104559 \">table 1</a>). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88597759\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASURING SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGIOUSNESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a variety of tools for measuring patient spirituality and religiousness. One of the most comprehensive tools for general health research is the Multidimensional Measures of Religiousness and Spirituality (MMRS), which was developed by an expert panel working group convened by the Fetzer Institute and the National Institute on Aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The tool identifies 12 domains of <span class=\"nowrap\">spirituality/religiousness,</span> with scales for each domain, including measures of spiritual experiences such as the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] and the forgiveness scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. As highlighted by the MMRS, <span class=\"nowrap\">spirituality/religiousness</span> are multidimensional constructs. In general, spirituality and religiousness are conceptualized as separate, though often highly related, dimensions, commensurate with the aforementioned definitions of these terms. Measures of spiritual dimensions generally refer to an individual&rsquo;s search for or experience of spirituality (eg, meaning, purpose, connection to God or higher power). In contrast, religious dimensions in general refer to communally structured forms of spirituality, such as attendance of religious services. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88596399\"><span class=\"h1\">INFLUENCE OF SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGIOUSNESS ON OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients' spirituality and religiousness can influence healthcare decision making and healthcare outcomes including coping, quality of life, and pain management.<sup> </sup></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88596558\"><span class=\"h2\">Religiousness and healthcare decision making</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A growing body of literature supports the view that religion affects healthcare decision making, particularly at the end of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

The available data suggest that palliative care patients with higher levels of spirituality have better quality of life and that supporting spiritual well-being is useful, especially as patients approach the end of life.

A survey based study of 339 physicians and nurses examining predictors of spiritual care provision to advanced cancer patients found that spiritual care training was the main predictor of spiritual care provision (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for physicians = 11.20, 95% CI, 1.24 to 101; and AOR for nurses = 7.22, 95% CI, 1.91 to 27.30, respectively).

Spirituality (which includes religious and existential aspects of care) is one of eight specific domains of quality within palliative care, endorsed by the National Consensus Project (NCP) for Quality Palliative Care and other palliative care organizations, but it is one of the least studied and addressed domains within the care of the seriously ill. (See <a href=\"#H22162287\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spirituality and religiousness are distinct yet related entities. Spirituality has been broadly defined in terms of the ways individuals &ldquo;seek and express meaning and purpose, and the way they experience their connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to the significant or sacred&rdquo;. Spirituality may include religion and other worldviews but encompasses far more general ways in which these experiences are expressed. In contrast, religion represents the communal structures and expressions of spirituality that are shared by a group of people.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A growing body of literature supports the notion that patients' <span class=\"nowrap\">spirituality/religiousness</span> affects healthcare decision making and healthcare outcomes, including coping and quality of life:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Religious factors (eg, religious coping, religiousness, and religious beliefs about care) are associated with greater preference for and (in the case of positive religious coping) actual receipt of aggressive medical care at life&rsquo;s end. Furthermore, religiousness and religious beliefs about care are more commonly endorsed among certain <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> minority groups, most notably African-American and Latinos, which given their role in end-of-life decision-making, may account for some of the observed <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> disparities in end-of-life care. (See <a href=\"#H88596558\" class=\"local\">'Religiousness and healthcare decision making'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The available data support the view that palliative care patients with higher levels of spirituality have better quality of life and that supporting spiritual well-being is useful, especially as patients approach the end of life. In contrast, studies examining religiousness and its associations with patient quality of life are few, and these have not demonstrated consistent associations between positive religious coping and improved patient quality of life. In contrast, negative religious coping has been consistently found to be associated with decrements in patient quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H22162325\" class=\"local\">'Impact of spirituality/religion on quality of life outcomes'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spiritual practices of caregivers and families can influence both patient and caregiver outcomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F104559\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104559 \">table 1</a>). Although the number of studies exploring spiritual domains and outcomes among caregivers is limited, the available data suggest that <span class=\"nowrap\">spirituality/religion</span> plays an important role in caregiver well-being. Spiritual pain appears to be frequent among caregivers of patients with serious illness and is associated with poorer caregiver quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H22162337\" class=\"local\">'Family spiritual domains and outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The available data specifically examining the impact of spiritual care provided by medical teams on patient outcomes demonstrate a positive impact of spiritual support on patient quality of life, while more limited data suggest that spiritual support facilitates transitions to more quality of life focused forms of end-of -life medical care (eg, greater hospice use, less aggressive interventions). Specific spiritual interventions (eg, dignity therapy, meaning based psychotherapy) demonstrate modest improvements in quality of life outcomes. Many studies of palliative care interventions have included a spiritual component as a key domain, with these studies variably demonstrating benefits to patient quality of life and care quality, though it is unclear to what degree the spiritual component of these interventions contributed to those outcomes. Finally, data informing mind body interventions for patients are few, and thus far have not consistently demonstrated benefits to patient well-being; whereas among caregivers, the available data suggest mindfulness-based interventions have modest benefits to caregiver quality of life.
