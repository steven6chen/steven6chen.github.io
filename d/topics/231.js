The diagnosis is particularly challenging during pregnancy because of the relatively high prevalence of <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/gastrointestinal</span> discomfort, anatomic changes related to the enlarged uterus, and the physiologic leukocytosis of pregnancy. Appendiceal rupture occurs more frequently in pregnant women, especially in the third trimester, possibly because these challenges and reluctance to operate on pregnant women delay diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1952944\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute appendicitis is suspected in <span class=\"nowrap\">1/600</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000</span> pregnancies and confirmed in <span class=\"nowrap\">1/800</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1500</span> pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. In a case control study of 53,000 women undergoing appendectomy, pregnant women were less likely to have appendicitis than age-matched, nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The incidence of appendicitis was slightly higher in the second trimester than in the first and third trimesters or postpartum. In addition, cohort study of over 350,000 pregnancies reported that the rate of acute appendicitis was 35 percent lower during the antepartum period than the time outside of pregnancy. This study reported the lowest rates of appendicitis during the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For women aged 15 to 34 years, there was no increased risk in postpartum appendicitis compared with the time outside of pregnancy. In contrast, an 84 percent increased risk of postpartum appendicitis was reported for women older than 35 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1954159\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the &quot;classic&quot; presentation, the patient describes the onset of abdominal pain as the first symptom. The pain is periumbilical initially and then migrates to the right lower quadrant as the inflammatory process progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Anorexia, nausea and vomiting, if present, follow the onset of pain. Fever up to 101.0&ordm;F (38.3&ordm;C) and leukocytosis develop later. </p><p>However, many patients have a nonclassical presentation, with symptoms such as heartburn, bowel irregularity, flatulence, malaise, or diarrhea. If the appendix is retrocecal, patients often complain of a dull ache in the right lower quadrant rather than localized tenderness. Rectal or vaginal examination in such patients is more likely to elicit pain than abdominal examination. A pelvic appendix can cause tenderness below McBurney's point (described below); these patients often complain of urinary frequency and dysuria or rectal symptoms, such as tenesmus and diarrhea. The spectrum of clinical and laboratory findings associated with acute appendicitis is described in detail separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pregnant women are less likely to have a classic presentation of appendicitis than nonpregnant women, especially in late pregnancy. The most common symptom of appendicitis, ie, right lower quadrant pain, occurs close to McBurney's point in the majority of pregnant women, regardless of the stage of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/5,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,15</a>]; however, the location of the appendix migrates a few centimeters cephalad with the enlarging uterus, so in the third trimester, pain may localize to the mid or even the upper right side of the abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. </p><p>McBurney's point tenderness is described as maximal tenderness at 1.5 to 2 inches from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) on a straight line from the ASIS to the umbilicus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This tenderness may be less prominent during pregnancy because the gravid uterus lifts and stretches the anterior abdominal wall away from the inflamed appendix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Since direct contact between the area of inflammation and parietal peritoneum is impeded, there is less rebound tenderness or guarding. The gravid uterus may also inhibit contact between the omentum and the inflamed appendix.</p><p>The largest review describing the frequency of the clinical signs and symptoms of appendicitis in pregnancy included 720 cases reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The strength of this review is its size, which is 10-fold larger than other series; however, it has several limitations, including nonconsecutive selection of cases and case ascertainment prior to widespread use of current diagnostic imaging procedures. The following summary illustrates the cumulative frequency of signs and symptoms of appendicitis reported in this review. It does not account for differences in frequency according to gestational age and consists of a case mix of 75 percent acute inflammation only and 25 percent perforation.</p><p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain: 96 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Right lower quadrant: 75 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Right upper quadrant: 20 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea: 85 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting: 70 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anorexia: 65 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysuria: 8 percent</p><p/><p><strong>Signs:</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right lower quadrant tenderness: 85 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rebound tenderness: 80 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal guarding: 50 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectal tenderness: 45 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right upper quadrant tenderness: 20 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temperature &gt;37.8<sup>0 </sup>Celsius (100<sup>0</sup> F): 20 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1954364\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 80 percent of nonpregnant patients with appendicitis have a preoperative leukocytosis (white cells &gt;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> and a left shift in the differential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>].

In a retrospective review of 66,993 consecutive deliveries including 67 women with a probable diagnosis of acute appendicitis, the mean leukocyte counts in women with proven appendicitis and in those with histologically normal appendices were 16,400 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and 14,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Microscopic hematuria and pyuria may occur when the inflamed appendix is close to the bladder or ureter, but these findings are generally reported in less than 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/20,23,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23,29-32</a>].</p><p>Mild elevations in serum bilirubin (total bilirubin &gt;1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> have been described as a marker for appendiceal perforation (sensitivity 70 percent and specificity 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]).</p><p>An elevated c-reactive protein level occurs in appendicitis, but is a nonspecific sign of inflammation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1955986\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute appendicitis is a histological diagnosis. The clinical diagnosis should be strongly suspected in pregnant women with classic findings: abdominal pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, right lower quadrant tenderness, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> fever, and leukocytosis with left shift (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above). </p><p>With a nonclassical presentation, which often happens in pregnancy, imaging is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,4,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,32</a>]. The primary goal of imaging is to reduce delays in surgical intervention due to diagnostic uncertainty. A secondary goal is to reduce, but not eliminate, the negative appendectomy rate. In these cases, ultrasound may reveal the probable cause of the patient&rsquo;s symptoms (eg, ovarian cyst or torsion, degeneration or torsion of a fibroid, nephrolithiasis, cholecystitis).</p><p>The diagnosis of acute appendicitis in a laboring patient requires a high index of suspicion, is especially difficult, and may not be possible. Labor can be associated with pain that may be lateralized, fever if chorioamnionitis is present, leukocytosis, and vomiting. Persistence or progression of these symptoms after delivery should prompt physical examination and imaging studies to evaluate for appendicitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1953532\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1953539\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial modality of choice for diagnostic imaging of the appendix in pregnancy is graded compression ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The clinical diagnosis of suspected appendicitis is supported by identification of a noncompressible blind-ended tubular structure in the right lower quadrant with a maximal diameter greater than 6 mm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53123%7EOBGYN%2F58749\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53123 graphicRef58749 \">image 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. The diagnosis should not be excluded if the appendix is not visualized.</p><p>Test performance appears to be lower in pregnant women than nonpregnant individuals because the gravid uterus can alter the location of the appendix, can interfere with visualizing the appendix and performing graded compression, particularly in the third trimester, and can lead to inconclusive ultrasound findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. Several studies reported nonvisualization of the appendix in a large percentage of pregnant women with suspected appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>]. However, in one review of studies of the value of ultrasound in diagnosing appendicitis in pregnancy, sensitivity ranged from 67 to 100 percent and specificity ranged from 83 to 96 percent, compared to general population in whom sensitivity and specificity were 86 and 96 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. We believe that the wide variation in the reported diagnostic performance of graded compression ultrasonography for appendicitis during pregnancy is due to multiple factors such as gestational age, maternal body mass index (BMI), and importantly, the training and experience of the sonologist or radiologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1953566\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For pregnant women whose ultrasound examination is inconclusive for appendicitis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred next test as it avoids the ionizing radiation of computed tomography and appears to be cost-effective (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66666\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66666 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/34,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,46,47</a>]. When MRI is performed in pregnant women, gadolinium is not routinely administered because of theoretical fetal safety concerns, but may be used if essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a>.)</p><p>MRI has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing appendicitis during pregnancy. A meta-analysis of 12 studies that included 933 pregnant women who underwent MRI evaluation for suspected acute appendicitis reported a sensitivity of 94 percent (95% CI 87 to 98 percent) and specificity of 97 percent (95% CI 96 to 98 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The largest study of pregnant women suspected of having acute appendicitis (over 700 women), which was not included in the above meta-analysis, reported 61 women had surgically confirmed disease out of 66 women with suggestive MRI findings (ie, appendiceal dilation, appendicolith, free fluid, and fat stranding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Based on this detection rate, the study reported the following pooled data for MRI assessment of appendicitis in pregnant women:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive predictive value 92.4 percent (95% CI 83.2-97.5)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negative predictive value 99.7 percent (95% CI 98.9-99.9)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensitivity 96.8 percent (95% CI 89-99.6)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specificity 99.2 percent (95% CI 98.2-99.8)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accuracy 99.0 percent (95% CI 98.0-99.6)</p><p/><p>Of the five women with false-positive MRI studies, pathologic evaluation identified one ovarian torsion, one appendicolith with mild lymphoid hyperplasia, one fibrous obliteration of the appendiceal lumen without changes of acute appendicitis, and two normal appendices. </p><p>Compared with ultrasound, additional benefits of MRI include potential identification of peri-appendiceal findings when the appendix is not visualized and recognition of other causes of abdominal pain. In the study of over 700 women above, of 207 women whose appendix was not visible on MRI, three were surgically diagnosed with appendicitis; two women had positive secondary MRI findings (ie, right lower quadrant fluid and pericecal stranding) for appendicitis and one woman had a negative MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Of 643 pregnant women whose MRI studies were negative for appendicitis, 72 women had alternate MRI findings that could have accounted for their acute pain.</p><p>In reviewing the MRI images, the T1 bright appendix sign can be a useful finding for excluding appendicitis, in addition to the routinely used findings of enlarged appendix size, periappendiceal fat stranding, and high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images. The T1 bright appendix sign, which is typically seen in normal pregnant women, is defined as a high intensity signal filling more than half length of the&nbsp;appendix&nbsp;on&nbsp;T1-weighted imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F114187\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114187 \">image 3</a>). In a retrospective study of 125 pregnant women with suspected appendicitis, the T1 bright appendix was identified in 51 percent of women without appendicitis, but only in 4.5 percent of women with appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 44.9, 95.5, 97.6, and 30 percent, respectively. Thus, visualization of a bright appendix is helpful in excluding appendicitis, but a negative finding is not diagnostic for the disease.</p><p>If there is a prolonged wait time for MRI evaluation, the risk of potential appendiceal rupture is balanced against the potential benefits of the study, such as identifying a different cause of pain or avoiding surgery. If MRI if not readily available, then computed tomography (CT) scan can be performed if the diagnosis is unclear. If either imaging modality is not available quickly or if the patient declines CT because of the radiation exposure, surgery should not be delayed in pregnant women with findings suggestive of appendicitis despite inconclusive ultrasound results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1953599\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT is generally widely available. The main findings of appendicitis on CT are right lower quadrant inflammation, an enlarged nonfilling tubular structure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an appendicolith (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80097\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80097 \">image 4</a>). The initial experience with helical computed tomography for the diagnosis of appendicitis in pregnancy appears promising, but data are limited to small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Modifications to the CT protocol can limit estimated fetal radiation exposure to less than 3 mGy, well below doses known to potentially cause adverse fetal effects (30 mGy for risk of carcinogenesis, 50 mGy for deterministic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]), and do not limit diagnostic performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/52,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,55</a>]. Standard abdominal CT scanning with an oral contrast preparation and intravenous contrast or a specialized appendiceal CT scanning protocol can also be used, but are associated with higher fetal radiation exposure (20 to 40 mGy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/54,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,56</a>]). The relative advantages and disadvantages of the two protocols and what constitutes a positive study are described separately.

A meta-analysis of three retrospective studies in pregnant women reported the sensitivity and specificity of CT in cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">normal/uncertain</span> ultrasonography were: sensitivity 85.7 percent (95% CI 63.7-96) and specificity 97.4 percent (95% CI 86.2-99.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. These studies included 2 to 49 patients with appendicitis. In one of the studies, the negative laparotomy rates among patients who underwent (1) clinical examination alone, (2) clinical evaluation and ultrasound examination, and (3) clinical evaluation and ultrasound examination followed by CT were 54 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(7/13),</span> 36 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(20/55),</span> and 8 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/13),</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

These patients usually present within one week after delivery and appear clinically ill; symptoms may include fever and abdominal pain and tenderness localized to the right if the right ovarian vein is affected. Nausea, ileus, and other gastrointestinal symptoms may occur but are usually mild, which may be helpful in distinguishing right-sided OVT from appendicitis.

Perioperative antibiotic treatment should provide Gram-negative and Gram-positive coverage (eg, a second-generation cephalosporin) and coverage for anaerobes (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>). Management with antibiotic therapy alone is not recommended because it is associated with both short-term and long-term failure, with minimal data in pregnant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults#H26003216\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute appendicitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Evidence for nonoperative management'</a>.)</p><p>Prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention are indicated, as delaying surgical intervention for more than 24 hours after symptom onset increases the risk of perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/2,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,40</a>], which occurs in 14 to 43 percent of such patients. Maternal morbidity following appendectomy is comparable to that in nonpregnant women and low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], except in patients in whom the appendix has perforated. Importantly, the risk of fetal loss is increased when the appendix perforates (fetal loss 36 versus 1.5 percent without perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]) or when there is generalized peritonitis or a peritoneal abscess (fetal loss 6 versus 2 percent; early delivery 11 versus 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]). </p><p>Given the difficulties in the clinical diagnosis of appendicitis and the significant risk of fetal mortality if the appendix perforates, a higher negative laparotomy rate (20 to 35 percent) compared to nonpregnant women is generally considered acceptable. Aggressive use of radiologic imaging, including ultrasound, magnetic resonance (MR), and computed tomography (CT) scanning, has the potential to reduce the incidence of negative appendectomy. There is some evidence that the higher rate of negative laparotomy in pregnant women is linked, at least in part, to a reluctance to perform preoperative CT in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/38,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,64</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1953532\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>A normal-appearing appendix at time of surgery should be removed because histological examination may reveal acute inflammation, excision avoids the potential for future evaluation and intervention for suspected appendicitis, and appendectomy is associated with a very low risk of complications. </p><p>Cesarean delivery is rarely indicated at the time of appendectomy. For patients who remain undelivered, the risk of dehiscence of the appendectomy incision during labor and vaginal delivery should not be increased when the fascia has been appropriately reapproximated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Perforated appendix</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of appendiceal perforation depends on the nature of the perforation: free versus walled-off.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17178339\"><span class=\"h3\">Free perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A free perforation can cause intraperitoneal dissemination of pus and fecal material.

Urgent laparotomy is necessary for appendectomy with irrigation and drainage of the peritoneal cavity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17178346\"><span class=\"h3\">Walled-off perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpregnant patients who present with a long duration of symptoms (more than five days) and have findings of a contained perforation can be treated initially with antibiotics, intravenous fluids, bowel rest, and close monitoring. These patients will often have a palpable mass on physical examination and imaging may reveal a phlegmon or abscess. Many of these patients will respond to nonoperative management since the appendiceal process has already been &quot;walled-off.&quot; Moreover, immediate surgery in patients with a long duration of symptoms and phlegmon formation is associated with increased morbidity due to dense adhesions and inflammation. Under these circumstances, appendectomy often requires extensive dissection and may lead to injury of adjacent structures. Complications such as a postoperative abscess or enterocutaneous fistula may ensue, necessitating an ileocolectomy or cecostomy. Because of these potential complications, a nonoperative approach is a reasonable option if the patient is not ill-appearing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute appendicitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Perforated appendicitis'</a>.)</p><p>Although there is good evidence to support this approach to walled-off perforation in nonpregnant individuals, there is only sparse evidence in pregnant women. In a single report including only two patients, antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>), intravenous fluids, and bowel rest were associated with improvement in symptoms over two to three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In one patient, interval appendectomy was performed two months post-vaginal delivery. In the other patient, appendectomy was performed at cesarean delivery because of breech presentation with preterm labor; this patient had an appendiceal phlegmon that had been treated conservatively seven weeks earlier, but with recurrence of acute appendiceal inflammation. In both cases, treatment with antenatal glucocorticoids to induce fetal lung maturation and tocolytics was avoided due to concerns of suppressing clinical manifestations of worsening infection and delaying delivery if intraamniotic infection was also present. On the other hand, a letter to the editor described two deaths related to appendicitis in pregnant women who appeared to recover after treatment with antibiotics and were discharged from the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Until more information on nonoperative management of ruptured, but contained, appendicitis during pregnancy is available, we suggest that these patients be carefully monitored in the hospital for maternal sepsis and preterm labor. </p><p>While there is some support for interventional drainage of appendiceal abscesses in children, there is no information regarding such management in pregnant patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the diagnosis is relatively certain, both open and a laparoscopic appendectomy are considered. No randomized trials have been performed to suggest that one technique is better than another, and the choice of technique should be based on the surgeon&rsquo;s experience level. The intraoperative management of pregnant women undergoing non-obstetric surgery and monitoring of the fetus are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the pregnant patient undergoing nonobstetric surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18196825\"><span class=\"h2\">Open appendectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When performing an open appendectomy in a pregnant woman, a transverse incision is made at McBurney's point or, more commonly, over the point of maximal tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. When the diagnosis is less certain, we suggest a lower midline vertical incision since it permits adequate exposure of the abdomen for diagnosis and treatment of surgical conditions that mimic appendicitis. A vertical incision can also be used for a cesarean delivery, if subsequently required for the usual obstetric indications. It is prudent to minimize traction on the uterus and uterine manipulation, although an association between these maneuvers and preterm birth is unproven.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18196838\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopic appendectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case reports, case series and small cohort studies on the use of laparoscopic appendectomy in pregnancy suggest that laparoscopy can be performed successfully during all trimesters and with few complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/4,66-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,66-77</a>]. The decision to proceed with a laparoscopic approach should take into consideration the skill and experience of the surgeon, as well as clinical factors such as the size of the gravid uterus. Suggestions for modification of laparoscopic technique during pregnancy include slight left lateral positioning of the patient during the second half of pregnancy, avoiding the use of any cervical instruments, use of open entry techniques or placement of trocars under direct visualization, and limiting intraabdominal pressure to less than 12 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) guidelines recommend insufflation pressures of 10 to 15 mm Hg and that the port position should be adapted for fundal height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-surgery-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, concern has been raised that laparoscopic appendectomy may be associated with higher rates of preterm delivery and fetal loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-82</a>]. In a 2012 meta-analysis of 11 studies that included 3415 women, the risk of fetal loss was greater for laparoscopic versus open appendectomy in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. In the largest of the included studies, the rates of fetal loss in the laparoscopic and open groups were 7 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Limitations of the studies in this meta-analysis include retrospective design and lack of adjustment for confounders such as patient age, duration or pregnancy, complications of appendicitis, surgeon skill, and clinical setting. A subsequent 2014 systematic review that included many of the above studies stated that while low-grade evidence suggested that laparoscopic appendectomy during pregnancy may be associated with higher rates of fetal loss, the evidence was not strong enough to determine the preferred modality of appendectomy during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>In our practice, we find the use of laparoscopy safe, especially when patients are appropriately monitored and no overt signs of preterm labor exist. Laparoscopy affords optimal visualization and recovery when performed by experienced surgeons. We use slightly lower intraabdominal pressures of 10 to 12 mmHg (which provides excellent visualization), an open entry technique, and directly visualized trocar insertion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17178287\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term prognosis for women who undergo appendectomy during pregnancy is generally good, but data are limited to observational series. It appears that preexisting morbidities, and not the surgery itself, are the greater risk factors for postoperative adverse obstetric events. In a national cohort study of nearly 20,000 women who underwent either appendectomy or cholecystectomy during pregnancy, risk factors most strongly associated with an adverse obstetric outcome included cervical incompetence, preterm labor during the current pregnancy (but prior to surgery), vaginitis or vulvovaginitis, and sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Other factors that had a more moderate impact on risk included non-white <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> Medicaid insurance, drug abuse or dependence, multiple gestation, and open surgery (ie, laparotomy). Of the approximately 5 percent of women with adverse obstetric outcome at all stages of pregnancy, children had normal development at 13 to 17 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute appendicitis is the most common general surgical problem encountered during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of appendicitis in pregnancy are similar to those in nonpregnant individuals; however, the following points should be noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Right lower quadrant pain is the most common symptom and occurs within a few centimeters of McBurney's point in most pregnant women, regardless of the stage of pregnancy. In late pregnancy, pain may be the right mid or upper quadrant. Rebound tenderness and guarding are less prominent in pregnant women, especially in the third trimester. (See <a href=\"#H1954159\" class=\"local\">'Patient presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mild leukocytosis can be a normal finding in pregnant women: the total leukocyte count may be as high as 16,900 <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/microL</span> in the third trimester and 29,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> during labor, so leukocytosis may or may not be a sign of appendicitis. (See <a href=\"#H1954364\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical diagnosis should be strongly suspected in pregnant women with classic findings: abdominal pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, right lower quadrant tenderness, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> fever, and leukocytosis with left shift. (See <a href=\"#H1955986\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">With a nonclassical presentation, which often happens in late pregnancy, imaging is indicated. The primary goal of imaging is to reduce delays in surgical intervention due to diagnostic uncertainty. A secondary goal is to reduce, but not eliminate, the negative appendectomy rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest graded compression ultrasonography in pregnant patients suspected of having appendicitis. Appendicitis is diagnosed if a noncompressible blind ended tubular structure is visualized in the right lower quadrant with a maximal diameter greater than 6 mm. (See <a href=\"#H1953539\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasonography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If clinical findings and ultrasound are inconclusive, or in centers where experience with sonographic examination of the appendix is limited, we suggest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where available, because it avoids fetal exposure to ionizing radiation and performs well in diagnosis of lower <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> disorders. (See <a href=\"#H1953566\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest computed tomography (CT) when MRI is not available, given its proven value in nonpregnant individuals. (See <a href=\"#H1953599\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to proceed to laparotomy should be based upon the clinical findings, diagnostic imaging results, and clinical judgment. Delaying intervention for more than 24 hours increases the risk of perforation. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Management and short-term outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the diagnosis is relatively certain, we suggest performing appendectomy through a transverse incision over the point of maximal tenderness (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). When the diagnosis is less certain, we suggest a lower midline vertical incision (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
