This condition can cause muscle weakness and other problems.</p><p>Potassium is one of many substances called &quot;electrolytes&quot; that help carry electrical signals between cells. That's important because many cells rely on electrical signals to work right.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12037133\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hypokalemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom of hypokalemia is muscle weakness. The weakness usually starts in the legs and then spreads to the middle of the body and the arms. It can get so bad that you cannot move parts or all of your body. It can also damage muscles. In fact, it can even affect the muscles that control breathing, so it can make you stop breathing.</p><p>Hypokalemia can also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cause an irregular heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disrupt the electrical signals that control the heart</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impair the kidneys</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12037148\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes hypokalemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypokalemia most often happens in people who have been vomiting or had diarrhea for a while. It can also happen in people taking medicine called &quot;diuretics,&quot; such as hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide (brand name: Lasix). Vomiting, diarrhea, and these medicines can cause the body to lose too much potassium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12037163\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will need blood and urine tests to get diagnosed with hypokalemia. You might also need other tests depending on your age, other symptoms, and individual situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12037178\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hypokalemia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment usually involves taking potassium in pill form or through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot; If your hypokalemia was caused by a medicine you take, your doctor or nurse might change your dose or switch you to a different medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12037193\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-paralysis-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Periodic paralysis syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkalemia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperkalemia (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
