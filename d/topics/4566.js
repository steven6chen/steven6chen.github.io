Most studies have used an age cut-off of 40 to 45 years to define &quot;young&quot; patients with CHD or acute myocardial infarction (MI). The same age definition will be used in this review.</p><p>The prevalence of CHD in younger subjects is difficult to establish accurately since it is frequently a silent process. The frequency with which this occurs was examined in an autopsy study of 760 young (age 15 to 34 years) victims of accidents, suicides, or homicides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Advanced coronary atheromata were seen in 2 percent of men and no women aged 15 to 19. An advanced lesion was present in 20 and 8 percent of men and women aged 30 to 34, respectively, while 19 and 8 percent, respectively, had a &ge;40 percent stenosis of the left anterior descending artery.</p><p>There are also limited data on the frequency of MI in younger subjects. In the Framingham Heart Study, the incidence of an MI over a 10-year follow-up was 12.<span class=\"nowrap\">9/1000</span> in men 30 to 34 years old and 5.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/1000</span> in women 35 to 44 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence of MI was eight to nine times greater in men and women aged 55 to 64 years. In other studies, 4 to 10 percent of patients with MI were &le;40 or 45 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In two series of patients with CHD at &le;40 years of age, women comprised 5.6 and 11.4 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>].</p><p>Although CHD is an uncommon entity in young patients, it constitutes an important problem for the patient and the treating physician because of the devastating effect of this disease on the more active lifestyle of young patients. In addition, these patients have different risk factor profiles, clinical presentations, and prognoses than older patients. All of these factors should be taken into consideration when treating young patients with CHD.</p><p>A separate issue, acute MI during pregnancy, is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute myocardial infarction and pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CORONARY RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relative importance of risk factors for the development of CHD according to age was evaluated in a report in which 11,016 men aged 18 to 39 years were followed for 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The relative risks associated with the traditional risk factors were of similar magnitude as in a group of 8955 men aged 40 to 59 years. These included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ndash; Relative risk 1.63 per six-year increase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum cholesterol &ndash; Relative risk 1.92 per 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1.04 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> increase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systolic blood pressure &ndash; Relative risk 1.32 per 20 mmHg increase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cigarette smoking &#160;Relative risk 1.36 per 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">cigarette/day</span> increase</p><p/><p>Young patients with MI usually have multiple risk factors for CHD. In some studies, for example, as many as 90 to 97 percent had one or more traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In a prospective study of over 7000 women of mean age 27 years at baseline followed for an average of 31 years, there were 47 CHD deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The CHD mortality rates for those with no risk factors, only one risk factor, or two or more risk factors were 0.7, 2.4, and 5.4 per 1000 person-years, respectively. A comparable relationship was seen for cardiovascular disease mortality and for all-cause mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking is the most common and most modifiable risk factor in young patients. It has been noted in 65 to 92 percent of young patients with MI, compared to 24 to 56 percent of patients older than 45 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/6,9,12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,12-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-risk-of-smoking-and-benefits-of-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular risk of smoking and benefits of smoking cessation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In a registry study that enrolled 6892 patients with acute ST-elevation MI treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention from 1998 to 2010, smoking rates were highest for those aged 18 to 34 years, at 78.02 percent, compared with a smoking rate of 23.72 percent in that age stratum of the general population, with smoking rates notably decreasing with increasing age in the STEMI population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Younger patients with CHD more often have a family history of premature CHD: 41 compared to 28 and 12 percent in middle aged or elderly patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; and 57 versus 43 percent in two series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A higher incidence of a positive family history in young patients (64 percent) was noted in the largest report of 823 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In addition, the offspring of patients with premature CHD are more likely to have coronary risk factors than those without such a family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These include excess body weight and higher levels of serum cholesterol, glucose, and insulin. These offspring are also more likely to have evidence of vascular disease such as endothelial dysfunction and increased carotid artery intima-media thickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The association between family history and premature CHD can be due to both genetic and environmental factors. This was addressed in a study of 398 families in which 62 vascular biology genes were evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Missense variants of several thrombospondin genes were significantly associated with MI and CHD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipid abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypercholesterolemia is common in young patients with CHD, but its prevalence is similar to that in older patients. However, when compared to older patients, young patients have lower mean serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations (35 versus 43 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [0.9 versus 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> and higher serum triglycerides (239 versus 186 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.7 versus 2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HDL cholesterol: Clinical aspects of abnormal values&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypertriglyceridemia was, in one series, the most common lipid abnormality in young patients with MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It may be associated with glucose intolerance and a predominance of small atherogenic LDL particles, both of which predispose to atherosclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertriglyceridemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertriglyceridemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes and hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two other important coronary risk factors, diabetes mellitus and hypertension, appear to be less common in young patients with CHD than in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>]. However, young patients frequently have subtle problems with glucose metabolism. In one study of 108 patients without a history of diabetes mellitus who had an MI before the age of 45, 65 percent had decreased oral glucose tolerance and a hyperinsulinemic response to oral glucose challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This finding is consistent with other observations that impaired glucose tolerance in the absence of overt diabetes is a risk factor for coronary disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevalence of and risk factors for coronary heart disease in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'CHD before diabetes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obesity appears to be an independent risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis, at least in young men. This was illustrated in an autopsy study of approximately 3000 persons between the ages of 15 and 34 who died from noncardiac causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Increasing body mass index was associated with both fatty streaks and raised atherosclerotic lesions in the right coronary and left anterior descending coronary arteries in young men, but not young women. The effect of obesity on other risk factors (eg, lipid abnormalities, hypertension, glucose intolerance) accounted for only about 15 percent of the relationship between obesity and coronary atherosclerosis.</p><p>How this might occur is not known, but other studies have noted an apparently independent effect of obesity as an important coronary risk factor. A report from the Framingham Heart Study suggested that obesity in middle-aged subjects could account for as much as 23 percent of cases of CHD in men and 15 percent in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

It typically presents as an acute febrile illness in children under the age of five; the incidence is higher in Asian and Asian-American populations than in other groups. The etiology of KD is unknown, although an inflammatory response precipitated by an infectious agent is suggested by some epidemiologic data. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-epidemiology-and-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most important complication of KD is coronary vasculitis, leading to coronary aneurysm formation in 20 to 25 percent of untreated patients during the acute stage of the disease. Nearly half of acute aneurysms regress, but approximately 20 percent lead to the development of coronary stenosis in the long term. Patients can present with MI or SCD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While patients with known KD are followed for the development of coronary artery stenoses, some patients who were not previously diagnosed are recognized only after presenting with sequelae of CHD, including MI, heart failure, and SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

Normal coronary arteries were much more common in women (41 versus 8 percent in men). Myocardial ischemia is present in a minority of the women with normal coronary arteries (20 percent in two reports), perhaps due to microvascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

The overall approach to therapy in these disorders is discussed elsewhere and is generally not dependent upon age. The following discussion will emphasize the issues of reperfusion with primary PCI or thrombolysis and revascularization in young patients.

Prospective randomized trials assessing primary PCI and thrombolytic therapy for an acute ST elevation MI have observed that both young and old patients have a better outcome with PCI than thrombolysis. However, young patients do better than older patients regardless of the therapy received. In the GUSTO-IIb trial, for example, the outcome was improved with PCI compared with thrombolytic therapy for each 10-year patient group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Irrespective of treatment, the risk increased with age; after adjusting for baseline characteristics, each increment of 10 years of age increased the risk of death or reinfarction by 1.32.

Many cardiologists feel obligated to refer these patients for coronary angiography given their &quot;young age&quot; and the &quot;need to know the coronary anatomy.&quot; However, the observation that some young patients have normal coronary arteries (18 percent in the CASS trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]) or nonobstructive coronary disease does not justify the routine use of this approach. An exercise stress test is a simpler and more cost-effective modality to risk stratify young patients with CHD and an MI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing to determine prognosis of coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of this approach is illustrated by the following observations. One report evaluated 129 patients under 40 years of age who had coronary angiography within 60 days of their first acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

The revascularization rate in this group was 41 percent.</p><p/><p>A smaller study also found that exercise testing in the young patient who is asymptomatic after an MI is an effective technique to identify a low risk group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-heart-disease-and-myocardial-infarction-in-young-men-and-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. No surgically correctable disease was found in 19 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization for prognosis and were able to reach at least stage 4 on a Bruce protocol exercise test.</p><p>Based upon these data, we recommend early coronary angiography only for young patients with high-risk features such as recurrent ischemia or multiple risk factors. Many other lower-risk patients with an uncomplicated course can undergo exercise stress testing for risk stratification before discharge.
