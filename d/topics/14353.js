These tumors are almost always benign and are usually microadenomas (ie, &lt;10 mm in diameter). In 30 to 40 percent, the microadenoma is so small that it is not detectable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), while in 10 to 15 percent a macroadenoma is present. Treatment is aimed first at the anterior pituitary gland.</p><p>The progressive stages of treatment that may be required to cure a patient of Cushing's disease are shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76949\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76949 \">algorithm 1</a>). Primary therapy consists of transsphenoidal surgery or pituitary irradiation. Patients who fail this first approach can be treated either by repeat transsphenoidal surgery, medical therapy, radiotherapy, or, as a final resort, surgical or medical adrenalectomy. An overview of transsphenoidal surgery and pituitary irradiation for the primary therapy of Cushing's disease will be reviewed here. An overview of the management of Cushing's syndrome, as well as medical therapy and surgical adrenalectomy for Cushing's are reviewed separately.

Surgical techniques and results of transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas are also reviewed in a separate topic.

Traditionally, the procedure involved transsphenoidal exploration through either a sublabial or endonasal approach, followed by use of a high-powered microscope that allowed for binocular vision. More recently, use of an endoscope, which does not provide binocular vision, has been advocated but has not been definitively shown to be superior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-therapy-of-cushings-disease-transsphenoidal-surgery-and-pituitary-irradiation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Ideally, the entire tumor is removed while normal pituitary tissue is left behind. However, in adult patients in whom a microadenoma cannot be identified at the time of surgery and for whom fertility is not an issue, 80 to 90 percent of the pituitary should be resected, leaving a small island attached to the stalk.

The blood sample is obtained before the morning hydrocortisone dose is taken.

Complete normalization of adrenocortical function may be a better predictor of outcome. As an example, in one study of patients after transsphenoidal surgery, those who had low postsurgery serum cortisol concentrations and subsequent recovery of normal circadian rhythm and responsiveness to insulin-induced hypoglycemia had much lower recurrence rates (3.4 percent) than those who did not recover normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function (50 to 65 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-therapy-of-cushings-disease-transsphenoidal-surgery-and-pituitary-irradiation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Other hormone tests also provide prognostic information.

These tumors are almost always benign and are usually microadenomas (ie, &lt;10 mm in diameter); in 30 to 40 percent, the microadenoma is so small that it is not detectable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), while in 10 to 15 percent, a macroadenoma is present. Treatment is aimed first at the anterior pituitary gland.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most adult patients with Cushing's disease, we suggest transsphenoidal surgery with an experienced surgeon as primary therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Transsphenoidal surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI is performed preoperatively to try to locate the pituitary tumor. However, surgery should be performed even if a tumor is not visualized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The operative approach varies. Traditionally, the procedure involved transsphenoidal exploration through either a sublabial or endonasal approach, followed by use of a high-powered microscope that allowed for binocular vision. More recently, use of an endoscope, which does not provide binocular vision, has been advocated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The extent of surgery varies. Ideally, the entire tumor is removed, while normal pituitary tissue is left behind. However, in adult patients in whom a microadenoma cannot be identified at the time of surgery and for whom fertility is not an issue, 80 to 90 percent of the pituitary should be resected, leaving a small island attached to the stalk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical complications &ndash; The main surgical complication is diabetes insipidus, which occurs transiently in up to approximately 20 percent of patients but is rarely permanent. (See <a href=\"#H616877\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes insipidus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biochemical assessment for cure &ndash; Serum cortisol should be measured at 8 AM at least 24 hours after the last physiologic dose of glucocorticoid, beginning three to seven days after surgery, to assess cure. Ideally, measurements are obtained for three consecutive days without glucocorticoid therapy. Although an extremely low serum cortisol concentration (&lt;1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> is the best predictor of cure, there are exceptions to this as described above. (See <a href=\"#H618116\" class=\"local\">'Biochemical criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term monitoring &ndash; All patients should be reevaluated annually for several years and less frequently thereafter. This is particularly true for those who had intermittent hypersecretion of cortisol initially; these patients may seem to be cured after surgery but continue to secrete excess cortisol intermittently. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Long-term monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management if surgery fails &ndash; First, the presence of tumor on pathology and the previous testing should be examined to ensure that the diagnosis is correct. If only a part of the tumor has been resected, immediate repeat surgery is an option. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Treatment if surgery fails'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a secure diagnosis in whom surgery has failed and with little or no radiologically detectable residual tumor, we suggest radiation therapy as the next step (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In patients with mild disease in whom the possibility of an additional two to four months of hypercortisolism is not deemed too risky, medical therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pasireotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pasireotide</a> is an alternative, recognizing that it is successful in only a minority of individuals. Radiation with adjunctive medical therapy may be best in those with dural invasion or who have unresectable remaining tumor. Adrenalectomy may be favored in those with severe hypercortisolism who need immediate cure or in women desiring pregnancy in whom steroidogenesis inhibitors are contraindicated.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-therapy-of-cushings-disease-transsphenoidal-surgery-and-pituitary-irradiation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Orth DN, Liddle GW.
