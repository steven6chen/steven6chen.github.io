However, only 17 to 20 percent of patients report their symptoms to their physicians.

In two patients, anorectal manometry provoked symptoms of proctalgia fugax. Furthermore, increasing duration of pain was associated with an increase in anal resting tone and slow wave amplitude.

Although proctalgia has been reported in patients ranging from 10 to 87 years of age, it commonly affects individuals between 46 and 58 years. Spasm of the anal sphincter, pudendal nerve compression, and psychological factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of proctalgia fugax.

Although some studies have suggested that the pain may be precipitated by sexual intercourse, stress, sitting, defecation, or menstruation, in many cases there is no obvious trigger.

The Rome IV criteria also require the exclusion of other causes of rectal pain and major structural alterations of the pelvic floor.
