The gravida must nurture and host the fetus, but also adapt to a new body habitus and alterations in the hormonal milieu. Not surprisingly, these changes impact the musculoskeletal system, which can develop a variety of problems, such as generalized arthralgias, back pain, separation of the pelvic bones, transient osteoporosis, and tendonitis.</p><p>Pain related to the musculoskeletal system in pregnant women will be reviewed here. Neurological disorders, myopathies, and inflammatory muscle diseases are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic disorders complicating pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL PREGNANCY CHANGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During pregnancy, women gain 25 to 35 pounds, on average, have a shift in their point of gravity, and undergo multiple hormonal changes and biomechanical alterations that strain the axial skeleton and pelvis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Endocrine and metabolic changes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The weight gain and hormonal changes of pregnancy contribute to the following musculoskeletal alterations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Force across some joints is increased up to twofold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exaggerated lordosis of the lower back, forward flexion of the neck, and downward movement of the shoulders typically occur to compensate for the enlarged uterus and change in center of gravity. Stretching, weakness, and separation of abdominal muscles further impede neutral posture and place even more strain on paraspinal muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint laxity in the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments of the lumbar spine creates more instability in the lumbar spine and can predispose to muscle strain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is widening and increased mobility of the sacroiliac joints and pubic symphysis in preparation for the fetus' passage through the birth canal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal lengthening, genital hiatal widening, and posterior vaginal relaxation occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant increase in the anterior tilt of the pelvis occurs, with increased use of hip extensor, abductor, and ankle plantar flexor muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Stance is widened to maintain trunk movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid retention can cause compression of certain vulnerable structures such as the median nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ligamentous laxity can affect stability of all weight-bearing joints from the pelvis to the foot.</p><p/><p>Many of these changes appear to be mediated by the hormone relaxin, which is produced by the corpus luteum, decidua, and placenta. The concentration peaks during the first trimester, when relaxin is thought to be involved with placental implantation and growth. Later in pregnancy, relaxin contributes to relaxation of the myometrium, separation of the symphysis pubis and softening of the cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Laxity in the joints of the extremities, however, appears to be due to other factors. This was illustrated in a study of joint laxity during pregnancy in which 19 of 35 women (54 percent) demonstrated a &ge;10 percent increase in wrist laxity from the first to the third trimester, but the increase did not correlate with relaxin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Furthermore, subjective joint pain was associated with increased estradiol and progesterone levels but not with elevated relaxin concentrations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LOW BACK PAIN AND DISC DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition, epidemiology, and etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low back pain is typically defined as musculoskeletal pain between the 12<sup>th</sup> rib and the gluteal fold that is not attributable to obstetric (eg, preterm labor), gynecologic (eg, ovarian cyst), urologic (eg, renal stone), or gastrointestinal (eg, irritable bowel) disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is a common problem among pregnant women, with more than 60 percent of pregnant women reporting pain in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Risk factors include preexisting back pain, back pain in a previous pregnancy, multiparity, and high body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In most cases, back pain is due to mechanical factors resulting from altered posture, muscle weakness, joint laxity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vertebral facet joint irritation. Fluid retention within connective tissue can also contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Degenerative spondylolisthesis (ie, the slipping forward of the body of one lumbar vertebrae on the vertebrae below) is aggravated by pregnancy. The L4 to L5 level is particularly vulnerable in women who have been pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Of note, neuraxial anesthesia for labor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delivery does not cause long-term back pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-effects-of-neuraxial-analgesia-and-anesthesia-for-obstetrics#H3016018035\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse effects of neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia for obstetrics&quot;, section on 'Backache'</a>.)</p><p>Disc herniation is rarely the cause of back pain during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. About 10 percent of nonpregnant women of childbearing age without back pain have asymptomatic lumbar disc herniation visible on magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbosacral spine, and 40 percent have disc bulges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The incidence of these abnormalities appears to be the same in nulliparous nonpregnant, multiparous nonpregnant, and pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3324847689\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3992585171\"><span class=\"h3\">Alarm findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As low back pain is common, often worsens as pregnancy progresses, and typically resolves postpartum, it can be challenging to differentiate pregnancy-related pain from other pathologies. In general, we refer women with the following symptoms or signs for further evaluation, typically with their primary care physician, orthopedic surgeon, or neurologist:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe pain that interferes with function, particularly nonpositional persistent back pain at night.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased pain with cough, sneezing, and Valsalva.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neurologic deficits by history: bladder or bowel incontinence, paresis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic deficits on examination: weakness, sensory deficit, abnormal reflexes. Of note, women with significant deficits are sent for immediate evaluation either in an emergency department or by an appropriate clinician (eg, neurosurgeon).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At high risk of infection (eg, recent epidural anesthesia) or on immunosuppressive therapy and women at risk for a compression fracture (eg, trauma or chronic glucocorticoid use) should also be referred for emergent evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, weight loss.</p><p/><p>Serious causes of low back pain and risk assessment of patients with low back pain are presented in detail separately.

The woman usually describes pain that is aggravated by activity and relieved by rest. It occurs in the lower back, but may radiate down the back of the thighs or, less often, over the lower part of the abdomen and anterior thighs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The pain is often worse at night, especially with turning, and may interfere with sleep.</p><p>We begin the physical examination by palpating the lower spine, paraspinal muscles, sciatic notches, and sciatic nerves to assess for tenderness, muscle spasms, or radiating pain. Nerve root irritation may be associated with tenderness in the following muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106237 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>S1 irritation affects calf muscles.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>L5 irritation affects the extensor hallucis muscle (which affects the toe walking test) and the anterior tibial muscles.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>L4 irritation affects the quadriceps and the anterior tibialis (which affects heel walking with foot dorsiflexion).</p><p/><p>Low back pain is generally characterized by lumbar pain above the sacrum, which is made worse by pregnancy-associated forward flexion of the waist, and decreased range of motion of the lumbar spine. In contrast, sacroiliac pain is made worse by hip rotation. With the patient supine, compression of the iliac crests may reproduce pain related to sacroiliac joint dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic girdle pain'</a> below.)</p><p>For comparison, discogenic pain is frequently worse on flexion of the back, such as when touching the toes from a standing position. Chronic discogenic pain worsens with flexion, but with an acute herniation, the individual can rarely even stand up straight, as the herniation protrudes posteriorly and is compressed by extension. In facet pain, the pain is worse when the spine is extended and is localized to the level of the irritated facet.</p><p>Physical examination should also evaluate for the presence of significant muscle weakness, sensory impairment, or deep tendon reflex changes suggesting radiculopathy. A detailed description of the physical examination in patients with back pain can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, the definitive physiologic cause of back pain symptoms cannot be established. Laboratory tests are not useful and imaging studies are not generally indicated, except in cases with significant neurologic findings. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually performed if an invasive intervention, such as epidural steroid injection or surgery, is contemplated and in complicated cases. The indications for MRI of the lumbosacral spine in pregnant women with low back pain are the same as in nonpregnant women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults#H83194028\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1617257905\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests the following interventions to ease back pain during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear low-heeled (but not flat) shoes with good arch support.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get help when lifting heavy objects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place a board between the mattress and box spring if your bed is too soft.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squat down, bend knees and keep the back straight when lifting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sit in chairs with good back support, or use a small pillow to provide support.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep on the side with pillows between the knees for support.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply heat, cold, or massage to the painful area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, if it is necessary to stand or sit for a prolonged period, taking breaks and placing one foot on a low stool relieves pressure on the lower back. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute low back pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional interventions have been tried; a multimodal approach appears most helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rest</strong> &ndash; Periods of rest with hip flexion can reverse the lordosis and temporarily decrease pain. The woman should lie in the lateral recumbent position, with her knees and hips bent. A pillow can be used to support the weight of the uterus or placed between the knees to reduce the mechanical burden on the back [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exercise</strong> &ndash; The available evidence suggests that exercise is helpful in reducing low back pain associated with pregnancy. A meta-analysis of 34 trials that included over 5100 pregnant women with back and pelvic pain reported that exercise may reduce pregnancy-related low back pain and improve functional disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A different meta-analysis of 11 trials (n = 2347 women) reported that exercise reduced the risk of low back pain, but not pelvic pain, and decreased the likelihood of sick leave due to lumbopelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Lastly, a meta-analysis of four trials (n = 566 women) found that exercise, support belts, and acupuncture may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The purpose of back exercises is to strengthen the trunk muscles to stabilize the spine. Back flexion exercises strengthen the abdominal muscles and also reduce the lumbar lordosis, while extension exercises strengthen the paraspinal muscles. Walking is generally prescribed to relieve some of the hamstring tightness and to lessen chronic discogenic symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low back pain in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complementary therapies</strong> &ndash; A systematic review of eight trials on complementary and alternative medicine for low back pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic pain in pregnancy reported reduced visual analogue pain scores for women treated with acupuncture based on three trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, variations in the duration of treatment, gestational age at treatment, and control groups limit the ability to make definitive conclusions or practice recommendations. In the same systematic review, osteopathy and chiropractic modalities were not associated with pain reduction, but the data were based on one trial for each treatment group. Other trials have reported that acupuncture appears to be more beneficial than physiotherapy, but both can be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].

For women who require disc surgery while pregnant, many can receive epidural or spinal anesthesia. Antenatal consultation with the surgeon and anesthesiologist may be helpful in allaying patient concerns. Cesarean delivery is required only for the usual obstetric indications, but instrumental vaginal delivery may be useful to avoid increased intrathecal pressures associated with the Valsalva maneuver.

As noted, the symphysis pubis widens at the 10th to 12th week of gestation in response to high relaxin concentrations. This widening allows increased mobility of the pubic symphysis, which can be painful.

The pain is often potentiated by weight-bearing, especially with walking and climbing stairs. Turning in bed, lifting, or getting up from a chair may also cause pain. In some women, pain can be exacerbated by increased abdominal pressure such as with coughing or sneezing. Some women report waking up during the night because of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Women with pelvic girdle syndrome (ie, pain in all three pelvic joint regions) have pain that is experienced between the posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold in the area of the sacroiliac joints.

The location of the pain, if confirmed by physical examination, generally gives the diagnosis. Of note, women with intractable pain, fever, and neurologic symptoms (including inability to walk) in conjunction with the findings below should prompt emergent evaluation with radiographic imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F116032\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116032 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Posterior pelvic joint pain is assessed by the posterior pain provocation test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. With the patient supine and her hip flexed 90 degrees, the examiner exerts pressure on the knee and along the femur to the hip, while stabilizing the pelvis with a hand on the opposite anterior iliac spine. A positive test elicits pain in the ipsilateral buttock. This test has been found to be negative in patients with lumbar disc herniations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In addition, palpation of the sacroiliac joints, specifically the long dorsal ligament (dimples of Venus) may demonstrate nodules or tenderness to palpation. In the Patrick (Fabere) test, the hip is flexed, abducted, and externally rotated, and the affected leg is extended so that the ankle is on the opposite knee. There is normal range of motion at the hips and spine. The active straight leg raise, a test of function whereby the patient lifts her leg, finds it difficult, yet with compression finds greater ease in performing the task, has been associated with pelvic girdle pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. These and related tests are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F114703\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114703 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with hip pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pubic symphysis pain can be evoked by bilateral pressure on the trochanters or by hip flexion with the legs in extension. Rarely, a palpable groove at the level of the symphysis may be detected by internal or external examination. Of note, in a nonpregnant woman, the normal symphysis gap is 4 to 5 mm; with pregnancy, the gap increases by at least 2 to 3 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The diagnosis of diastasis is based on the persistence of symptoms and a separation of more than 10 to 13 mm on imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F114699\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114699 \">image 1</a>); however, radiographic imaging is not always required as the diagnosis can be made clinically on the basis of symptoms and response to therapy.

Of note, the amount of symphyseal separation does not necessarily correlate with severity of symptoms or the degree of disability. One study that performed radiographs of the pelvis and lower spine, MRI, urine dipstick, and blood tests (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, complete blood count, creatinine, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies) in women with transient or persistent pelvic joint pain and controls did not find any of these tests to be useful diagnostically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2248371247\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of PGP typically includes supportive treatment for the pain, physical therapy for stabilizing exercises, and supports or braces, if appropriate.

The plain radiograph can remain normal for months after symptoms of osteonecrosis begin; the earliest findings are mild density changes, followed by sclerosis and cysts as the disease progresses. The pathognomonic crescent sign (subchondral radiolucency) is evidence of subchondral collapse. Later stages reveal loss of sphericity or collapse of the femoral head. Ultimately, joint-space narrowing and degenerative changes in the acetabulum are visible.

Symptoms include dysesthesias in the upper and middle part of the lateral thigh and are probably caused by the expanding abdominal wall and increased lumbar lordosis. Symptoms occur late in pregnancy, typically resolve within three months postpartum, and rarely require treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Knee pain</strong> &ndash; Knee pain is not uncommon in pregnant women. Postural changes and increased laxity of ligaments are contributing factors. Ligamentous laxity in the knee occurs during the second half of pregnancy, and is not exacerbated by exercise programs with minimal to moderate weight bearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

Quadriceps and hip abduction strengthening exercises can help the patella track correctly, and patella sleeves can also be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The diagnosis and treatment of patellofemoral pain are discussed in more detail separately.

The cramps are due to painful muscle contractions and are generally experienced in the calves at night. They are thought to be secondary to a build-up of lactic and pyruvic acids leading to involuntary contraction of the affected muscles, but the exact etiology is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A Cochrane review found that the only placebo-controlled trial of calcium treatment showed no evidence of benefit in the treatment of leg cramps, but placebo controlled trials of magnesium supplementation suggested a possible benefit (odds ratio 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.60) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

Potential causes of foot pain include weight gain, peripheral ligamentous laxity, and changes in posture and pedal pressure points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>]. These changes can lead to overpronation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Peripheral edema also contributes to foot discomfort in pregnancy.
