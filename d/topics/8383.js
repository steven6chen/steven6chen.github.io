The pathogenesis of GTD is unique because the maternal tumor arises from gestational rather than maternal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>HM is made up of two distinct entities, complete hydatidiform mole and partial hydatidiform mole. These differ on the basis of chromosomal pattern, gross and microscopic histopathology, and clinical presentation and outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Molar pregnancies, although benign, are considered to be premalignant because they have the capability of developing into a malignancy. Malignant disease is referred to as gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN); the histologic entities included in this group are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive mole</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choriocarcinoma </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placental site trophoblastic tumor </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor </p><p/><p>The management of HM will be reviewed here.

Hysterectomy is an option in women who have completed childbearing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20921491\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine evacuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suction curettage is the preferred technique for uterine evacuation, regardless of uterine size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>For women with HM, we suggest uterine evacuation with suction curettage rather than medication-only methods. Use of medication-only methods for uterine evacuation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>) is controversial, and few studies have evaluated the efficacy or safety of this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Concern has been raised that inducing uterine contractions with uterotonics (oxytocin, prostaglandins) will increase the risk of trophoblastic embolization to the lungs or of metastatic disease. In addition, obtaining a specimen for pathology evaluation is crucial for confirming the diagnosis of HM and identifying complete versus partial mole. It is more difficult to obtain a complete specimen with medication-only evacuation. </p><p>The only study that evaluated medication-only evacuation for HM (n = 4257) reported that among women who underwent medication-only evacuation (mainly with prostaglandins), 20 of 77 (26 percent) subsequently required uterine curettage, and seven were treated with chemotherapy (9 percent compared with 4 to 6 percent after uterine curettage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Further study of this issue is needed. </p><p>During suction evacuation, we do not use prostaglandins for cervical ripening, based upon the study cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Starting at the time of anesthesia induction, we do administer an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> infusion (10 units in 1 L Ringer lactate solution at 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">drops/min)</span> to increase myometrial tone and facilitate contraction, and thus decrease blood loss. </p><p>The procedure for suction evacuation consists of mechanical dilation of the cervix, followed by suction evacuation and then curettage. The technique is the same as for spontaneous or induced abortion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-abortion-management#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous abortion: Management&quot;, section on 'Surgical evacuation'</a>.)</p><p>Mechanical dilation of the cervix should be performed gradually to accommodate a cannula diameter appropriate for the uterine size. Some clinicians advocate the use of laminaria inserted on the previous day in nullipara to facilitate dilation. During dilatation, brisk bleeding may be encountered due to passage of copious amounts of blood retained in the endometrial cavity. Evacuation of the uterine contents in a rapid, yet in a thorough and safe fashion, reduces overall blood loss. After the initiation of suction evacuation, the uterus generally shrinks rapidly, and bleeding is well controlled. If the uterus is larger than 14 weeks size, the surgeon may use fundal massage via the abdomen to facilitate uterine contraction. When suction evacuation is thought to be complete, a gentle sharp curette should be used to remove any residual chorionic tissue. Some surgeons prefer to use intraoperative sonography to monitor the procedure to determine when evacuation is complete. Whereas confirmation of the diagnosis of complete mole is usually possible on gross inspection of the curettings, the appearance of partial mole is frequently non-specific. Bleeding from a molar evacuation may be substantially more than from a spontaneous, missed, or incomplete abortion. Complete molar tissue will usually have markedly dilated villi that appear like grape clusters. The changes in partial mole are usually more subtle, and partial mole may only be suspected or diagnosed based upon the microscopic findings. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432807528\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients at high risk for GTN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients at a high risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) may benefit from hysterectomy or prophylactic chemotherapy. High-risk features are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H543309373\" class=\"local\">'Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20921499\"><span class=\"h3\">Hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest hysterectomy for women with HM who are &ge;40 years and have completed childbearing. GTN is more likely in this age group. Compared with uterine evacuation, hysterectomy appears to decrease, but not eliminate, the risk of GTN. (See <a href=\"#H543309373\" class=\"local\">'Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia'</a> below.) </p><p>The benefit of hysterectomy in this age group was illustrated in a series of 82 women aged 40 to 49 with complete mole; GTN developed in 37 of 68 (54 percent) women treated with dilation and evacuation alone and in none of the six patients treated with hysterectomy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Markedly elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels &gt;175,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> appeared to constitute an &quot;ultra high-risk&quot; group for whom prophylactic chemotherapy or hysterectomy should be especially considered. Eleven (85 percent) of thirteen patients with pre-evacuation hCG levels &gt;175,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> developed GTN. Similarly, another study that included 22 women aged 50 or older with complete mole found that GTN developed in 9 of 15 patients (60 percent) treated with dilation and evacuation alone and in none of the seven patients who underwent primary hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>When counseling patients about treatment options, it is important to inform the patient that hysterectomy eliminates local invasion and reduces the chance of developing persistent trophoblastic disease, but it does not prevent all cases of metastatic disease due to occult metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Women treated with hysterectomy still require monitoring, including serial hCG levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Metastatic GTN develops in 4 percent of patients after uterine evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20921529\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.) </p><p>At time of hysterectomy, the ovaries may be preserved since ovarian metastases are rarely encountered. If prominent ovarian theca lutein cysts are present, they can be aspirated to reduce the volume and patient discomfort. Due to the highly vascular nature of the gravid uterus, supracervical hysterectomy is frequently performed to reduce blood loss and avoid ureteral injury. </p><p>Hysterectomy may also be performed for the emergency management of acute hemorrhage at the time of molar evacuation, although the use of uterine artery embolization has been shown to be successful in managing this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20921506\"><span class=\"h3\">Prophylactic chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At our institution, we offer chemotherapy infrequently after evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole to high-risk women (see <a href=\"#H543309373\" class=\"local\">'Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia'</a> below), but not to others. It may be particularly useful in patients with high-risk complete mole when hormonal follow-up is either unavailable or unreliable, as may be the case with adolescents or in certain resource-poor regions, such as some parts of Asia and Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Importantly, chemoprophylaxis does not appear to impact future fertility potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and actinomycin D have been used in this setting, and there are no data to suggest whether one should be the preferred agent. At our center, we generally administer actinomycin D to high-risk patients. </p><p>This practice (otherwise known as prophylactic chemotherapy or chemoprophylaxis) is supported by data that consistently show that chemotherapy can reduce the risk of subsequent progression or the diagnosis of GTN in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]. For women at low risk, we do not proceed with prophylactic chemotherapy, but rather initiate follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H20921529\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.) </p><p>The administration of prophylactic chemotherapy is supported by a 2012 meta-analysis that included three randomized trials (n = 613 patients, all diagnosed with complete mole) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The use of prophylactic chemotherapy was associated with a 63 percent reduction in the risk of GTN (relative risk [RR] 0.37, 95% CI 0.24-0.57). Despite this finding, issues related to the methodological quality of the trials, including the small size of the study populations included, limit the wider acceptance of this recommendation. In addition, as noted in this meta-analysis, the benefit of prophylactic chemotherapy is not entirely clear because other data suggest that patients who underwent prophylactic chemotherapy and were subsequently diagnosed with GTN experienced a delay in subsequent diagnosis and required more courses to achieve remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>At the New England Trophoblastic Center, we have treated 93 patients in this fashion, and only 10 (11 percent)<strong> </strong>developed persistent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Of note, none of these patients had metastatic disease at the time persistent disease was detected. Six patients were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> for persistent tumor, and of these, five required only one course of methotrexate to attain remission. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515626989\"><span class=\"h2\">Rh(D) immune globulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are Rh(D)-negative should receive anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> at the time of treatment because the Rh(D) factor is expressed on trophoblast. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of Rhesus (D) alloimmunization in pregnancy&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1748553\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1748560\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperthyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molar pregnancy-associated hyperthyroidism will resolve with treatment of the gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). Some patients will require antithyroid therapy until GTD treatment is complete. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be required before the induction of anesthesia to prevent or rapidly reverse many of the metabolic and cardiovascular complications of a thyroid storm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>The criteria for treatment and approach to therapy are the same as for other human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-mediated hyperthyroidism.

If they are symptomatic, they can be aspirated transabdominally under ultrasound guidance. Theca lutein cysts may cause adnexal torsion or, rarely, they rupture spontaneously. In such cases, they can be managed laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

After uterine evacuation for complete hydatidiform mole in the second trimester, approximately 2 percent of patients used to develop cardiopulmonary symptoms, including chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, and tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Auscultation of the chest usually reveals diffuse rales, and the chest radiograph often demonstrates bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. The signs and symptoms usually resolve within 72 hours after evacuation with cardiopulmonary support. </p><p>Respiratory distress is usually attributed to trophoblastic embolization, but can also be due to the cardiopulmonary complications of thyroid storm, toxemia, and massive fluid replacement. The presence of pulmonary infiltrates can sometimes be misinterpreted as metastases, for which chemotherapy is inappropriately administered. In most cases, the infiltrates will resolve over 48 to 72 hours as the hCG level decreases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The presence of pulmonary nodule(s) after molar evacuation in the face of falling hCG levels does not require chemotherapy. Trophoblastic emboli usually resolve spontaneously as long as the hCG level ultimately normalizes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20921529\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follow-up of treatment of hydatidiform mole (HM) consists of measurement of serial serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, until an undetectable level is reached and is maintained for several months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F105721\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105721 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Poor compliance with post-molar surveillance and treatment protocols is associated with poorer outcomes due to advanced disease. In the United States, indigent women treated at urban, public hospitals are the group most likely to fail to comply with standard protocols for a number of reasons, including cost, transportation issues, and childcare requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patient education is crucial to help patients to understand and comply with surveillance protocols. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20921537\"><span class=\"h2\">Serial hCG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with HM should be monitored with serial serum hCG testing values after evacuation to evaluate for postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543312623\"><span class=\"h3\">Surveillance protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advise the following protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every week until non-detectable for three weeks, then</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every month for six months &ndash; If the hCG remains undetectable for six months, then the patient may resume trying to become pregnant, if she wishes. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515627133\"><span class=\"h4\">Shorter duration of monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients find the six-month period of follow-up difficult to complete. Women may wish to begin attempting another pregnancy sooner, particularly those over age 35. Furthermore, weekly or monthly hCG testing is anxiety-provoking for many women, expensive, and inconvenient, making non-compliance common. </p><p>A shorter period of hCG monitoring appears to be safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/25-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-33</a>]. The risk of GTN is &lt;1 percent after an undetectable hCG level is attained, based upon data from several thousand women from multiple institutions, including the Charing Cross Hospital, University of Texas Southwestern, New England Trophoblastic Disease Center (NETDC), and centers in Hungary, Australia, Brazil, and the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/26-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-33</a>]. This was illustrated in a large series of women with molar pregnancy (n = 22,053) from Charing Cross Hospital in England; among women in whom the hCG normalized, only 1 in 760 developed GTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. If the hCG normalized within 56 days after evacuation, the risk of GTN was 1 in 1536 compared with 1 in 464 when hCG normalized in greater than 56 days. The mean time to first raised hCG level after normalization was 449 and 462 days in the &lt;56 and &gt;56 day groups, respectively. Due to the long interval to the hCG rise after normalization, it is possible that some of these cases were new molar conceptions. Similarly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], in a series of 1029 patients with complete mole treated with evacuation, no patient developed GTN after the hCG level became undetectable using an assay sensitive to &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span>.</p><p>Patients with partial mole may be particularly suitable for shortened duration of hCG surveillance because of their low risk of persistence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As an example [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], in a prospective cohort study (n = 2008) of patients registered at the French Trophoblastic Disease Centre, the risk of postmolar GTN after hCG normalization was 0.34 percent after complete mole, 0 percent after partial mole, and 0.36 percent after a multiple pregnancy with co-existing mole. Similarly, in a study involving 284 women with partial mole, none of the patients developed GTN following spontaneous decline and normalization of the hCG level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>On the basis of these data, it may be reasonable to abbreviate hCG follow-up for women with both complete mole and partial mole without appreciably increasing the risk of delayed diagnosis of GTN. It is the current policy at our center, the NETDC, to allow patients following either a complete or partial mole to become pregnant after achieving three consecutive weekly followed by three consecutive monthly undetectable hCG levels. </p><p>It is possible to utilize hCG regression curves to predict a patient&rsquo;s risk of developing GTN after molar evacuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. In one study, an hCG level of &gt;199 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> in the third through eighth week following partial mole evacuation was associated with at least a 35 percent risk of GTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Similarly, another study reported that women after a complete mole whose hCG levels were &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> in the fourth week after evacuation or &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> in the sixth week after evacuation had a risk of persistence below 9 percent.

Similarly, among 12,526 Brazilian patients with molar pregnancy, 96 (0.8 percent) had persistent but falling hCG at six months after evacuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

One cause of persistent (present for at least three months) low-level hCG is quiescent GTN, also referred to as inactive GTN. </p><p>Quiescent GTN is a persistently low level of hCG in the absence of any clinical or radiological evidence of GTN. While quiescent GTN most commonly occurs after a complete mole, it may develop after partial mole, invasive mole, or choriocarcinoma. This condition is thought to be due to the presence of a small focus of highly differentiated, non-invasive syncytiotrophoblast cells that produce small stable amounts of hCG and usually do not progress to invasive disease as long as cytotrophoblast or intermediate cells are absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>Quiescent GTN is characterized by the following: (1) foci of disease are not readily identifiable clinically, and (2) hCG level is unresponsive to therapy, presumably because the growth cycle of these cells is long and comparable to normal cells. Patients with quiescent GTN should not be treated with chemotherapy, but close follow-up is indicated because 6 to 10 percent will eventually develop active GTN, requiring treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].</p><p>The measurement of hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H) has been proposed for surveillance in patients with quiescent GTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/46,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48</a>]. hCG-H is a glycoprotein produced by cytotrophoblast cells and is associated with trophoblast invasion, growth of cytotrophoblast cells, and overall promotion of placental implantation. It is thought to be a promoter of choriocarcinoma growth and tumorigenesis, and is the main form of hCG produced in active GTN. </p><p>The presence of low levels of hCG-H indicates the presence of quiescent GTN. Increasing levels of hCG-H indicate the development of active GTN that requires treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. </p><p>Patients with quiescent GTN should be monitored with monthly hCG testing and advised to avoid pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Active GTN should be diagnosed, and treated appropriately, if hCG-H rises to greater than 20 percent of total hCG or if total hCG has two doublings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/48,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50,51</a>].

The differential diagnosis of persistent low hCG is discussed in detail separately.

A new pregnancy during this period would make it difficult or impossible to interpret hCG results and would complicate management. Options include hormonal contraception or barrier methods. Depot medroxyprogesterone is an option for women who have difficulty complying with contraceptive use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. An intrauterine device should not be used before the hCG normalizes because of the risk of uterine perforation due to subinvolution of the uterus or invasive mole. </p><p>Historically, women were advised to use only barrier contraception based upon a concern that hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk of GTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Some data suggest that this increased risk was associated with estrogen doses of 50 mcg or higher in older oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, the safety of postmolar use of oral contraceptives has been demonstrated in three reports, including two randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. The largest was a Gynecologic Oncology Group randomized trial (n = 266) that assigned patients to oral contraceptives or barrier contraception after evacuation of an HM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. No significant difference in the rate of postmolar trophoblastic disease was found between the groups; in fact, the oral contraceptive group had a lower rate (23 versus 33 percent). The median time to spontaneous regression in the oral contraceptives group was nine weeks, whereas the median time to regression in the barrier group was 10 weeks. Twice as many patients in the barrier group became pregnant in the immediate follow-up period. In addition, a systematic review of seven studies including 1533 women reported that all but one study found no increased risk of GTN with postmolar use of oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543309366\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543309373\"><span class=\"h2\">Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydatidiform mole (HM) is well recognized to have a risk of developing invasive disease, referred to as gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).</p><p>The reported incidence of GTN after each type of molar pregnancy is [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/9,58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,58-61</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete mole (15 to 20 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial mole (1 to 5 percent) </p><p/><p>The wide range of the reported incidence of postmolar GTN results from differences in diagnostic criteria and the size of the population studied. Among women with molar pregnancy, the risk factors for developing GTN include: (1) complete mole with signs of trophoblastic proliferation (uterine size greater than gestational age, serum human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] levels &gt;100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL);</span> (2) ovarian theca lutein cysts &gt;6 cm in diameter; and (3) age &gt;35 to 40 years. </p><p>The increased risk in complete mole with signs of marked trophoblastic proliferation was illustrated by data from our center, the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center (NETDC), from 858 women with complete mole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The presence versus absence of trophoblastic proliferative signs (uterine size greater than gestational age, serum hCG levels &gt;100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL,</span> and ovarian theca lutein cysts &gt;6 cm in diameter) was associated with significantly higher rates of uterine invasion (31.0 versus 3.4 percent) and metastases (8.8 versus 0.6 percent). Since complete moles are currently usually diagnosed in the first trimester, the classical signs of late molar pregnancy are not commonly encountered. Despite early diagnosis, however, the incidence of postmolar GTN is unchanged. First trimester complete moles still frequently present with high hCG values, and high hCG values in first trimester complete moles are still associated with the development of GTN. </p><p>Older patients with complete mole are also at increased risk of developing a postmolar tumor. Studies have found that 33 to 60 percent of women over age 40 with complete mole develop persistent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/7,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,62,63</a>]. Other studies have reported that 53 to 56 percent of women over 50 with complete moles developed postmolar tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/8,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,64</a>]. </p><p>Complete moles are more commonly aneuploid in older women, and aneuploidy may be a risk factor for GTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. One study reported that 10 of 13 (77 percent) aneuploid complete moles developed persistent tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p>In contrast to patients with advanced age, adolescents (&lt;age 20) do not appear to have a higher risk of developing postmolar disease. As an example, one study of the clinical presentation and outcome in 220 adolescent patients with complete mole noted a significantly decreased risk of developing GTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>For partial mole, no risk factors for developing GTN have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. After partial mole, persistent tumor is generally non-metastatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, 11 studies including 7579 patients with partial mole show that only 76 (1.0 percent) women developed persistent tumor and only nine (0.1 percent) had metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-management/abstract/2,3,68-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,68-76</a>].</p><p>Patients with repeat molar pregnancy are at an increased risk of developing persistent tumor.
