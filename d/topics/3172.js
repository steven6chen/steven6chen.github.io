The authors (including L.S.) proposed that the conditions known as follicular degeneration syndrome, pseudopelade (<strong>not</strong> classic pseudopelade of Brocq), folliculitis decalvans, and tufted folliculitis were all manifestations of CCSA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>2001 </strong>&ndash; A workshop on cicatricial alopecia sponsored by the North American Hair Research Society proposed replacement of the term &quot;scarring alopecia&quot; with &quot;cicatricial alopecia,&quot; resulting in the change of &quot;central centrifugal scarring alopecia&quot; to &quot;central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The two conditions were classified separately in the classification system for primary cicatricial alopecia proposed in the 2001 North American Hair Research Society workshop on cicatricial alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the author (L.S.) believes that folliculitis decalvans is a descriptive term for any form of highly inflammatory and chronic cicatricial alopecia of the central scalp and that most cases of folliculitis decalvans are in fact CCCA. Resolution of this controversy will require additional clinical studies.

Based upon data from case reports, case series, and cross-sectional studies, CCCA predominantly affects adult women of African descent with hair that grows in a tightly curled or kinked configuration and appears to be relatively common in this population. Examples of studies that have attempted to identify the prevalence of CCCA include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 233 African-American women recruited from attendees of a health and beauty symposium and church meetings in the southeastern United States found extensive central scalp hair loss (a finding that suggests but is not exclusive to CCCA) in 6 percent in the studied population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of black men and women in South Africa recruited from churches, community organizations, and hostels found a prevalence of physical findings consistent with CCCA in 3 percent of all women, including 7 percent of 191 women over the age of 50 years, 1 percent of 241 women aged 25 to 50 years, and none of 129 women aged 18 to 25 years, suggesting increasing prevalence with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Signs of CCCA were not diagnosed in any of the 267 adult male participants. A study of 564 schoolchildren (ages 6 to 21) in South Africa performed by the same authors did not find physical signs consistent with CCCA in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 326 African-American women in Cleveland, Ohio recruited for participation from two churches and a health fair found a prevalence of physical findings consistent with &quot;probable CCCA&quot; in 17 percent of the 310 women without a history of alopecia areata or lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The relatively high rate of CCCA suggested by this study compared with other reports may have been related to selection bias due to the method of recruitment; patients were recruited via advertisement for a hair study. </p><p/><p>The lack of a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of CCCA complicates the interpretation of the results of the above studies, as there are other potential causes of central scalp hair loss, including the relatively common condition female pattern hair loss. Additional data are needed to clarify the epidemiology of CCCA. (See <a href=\"#H7536344\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Although the South African study described above documented no cases of CCCA in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], the occurrence of CCCA in black men has been documented in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In the author&rsquo;s busy hair pathology practice, the female to male ratio for diagnoses of CCCA is about 10:1. </p><p>Well-documented cases of CCCA in non-black patients have not been published in the peer-reviewed literature. However, the author has diagnosed CCCA in a few Caucasian women, most of whom demonstrated folliculitis decalvans-like features. (See <a href=\"#H2177992\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2178401\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is not fully understood. We propose that an anatomical abnormality, namely premature desquamation of the inner root sheath (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53952 \">figure 1</a>), might serve as a critical predisposing factor that leads to a damaging sequence of events, as outlined below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premature desquamation of the inner root sheath develops in a predisposed individual (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91787\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91787 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a result of the premature loss of the inner root sheath, the hair shaft presses against the softer outer root sheath, eventually resulting in follicular rupture and a subsequent inflammatory response; alternatively, the premature desquamation of the inner root sheath may facilitate descent of environmental insults, such as chemical relaxers or bacteria, into the lowermost portion of the follicle, inciting inflammation and follicular damage. (See <a href=\"#H2178281\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nonspecific intense inflammatory cascade composed of acute and chronic inflammatory cells leads to the destruction of the follicular epithelium in the lower infundibulum and isthmus of the hair follicle and destruction of the stem cell region of the follicular bulge leads to an inability of the follicle to regenerate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91789\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91789 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A follicular scar (a column of connective tissue visible on histologic examination) develops at the site of the follicle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91790 \">picture 4</a>)</p><p/><p>Follicles that are not destroyed by the inflammatory process may heal in a cluster with similarly affected adjacent hairs, resulting in the formation of a common infundibular syncytium surrounded by a zone of fibrosis. This phenomenon manifests clinically as a tuft of hair shafts emerging from a common orifice, also known as <strong>tufted hairs</strong> or <strong>polytrichia</strong>. Tufted hairs are not specific for CCCA and can be found in other highly inflammatory forms of alopecia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91505\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91505 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2178281\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is unknown. Hair care practices that have the potential to damage the hair and scalp are commonly suggested contributing factors, though a contributory effect is unproven. Whether CCCA is a heritable condition also is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H375349\"><span class=\"h2\">Hair care practices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over the years, associations between CCCA and various hair care practices commonly used by black women have been proposed, including use of specialized metal combs for hair straightening (hot combs), chemical relaxers, and traction-inducing hair styles (eg, braids and hair weaves). However, the few studies that have explored the relationships between CCCA and hair styling practices have been subject to various forms of bias and have not been performed with sufficient scientific rigor to either prove or disprove a role for these practices in the pathogenesis of CCCA. In particular, an initial theory that this form of alopecia was exclusively a result of hot comb use was discarded after recognition of the condition in women who were not using hot combs or had never used hot combs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>One study that reported a relationship between traction-inducing hairstyles and CCCA is a survey study of patients seen at a single academic medical center in which 51 African-American women with a clinical and pathologic diagnosis of CCCA and 50 African-American women without CCCA were asked to recall their hair grooming practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although the study found that women with CCCA were more likely to have used hair weaves and cornrow or braided hair styles with artificial hair extensions than women without CCCA and that women with CCCA were more likely to report a history of uncomfortable pulling or tenderness on the scalp from hair weaves or braided hairstyles with extensions, a causative relationship cannot be confirmed based upon these findings. One potential confounding factor is that women with hair loss secondary to CCCA might be more likely to wear braids or weaves in an attempt to camouflage hair loss.</p><p>The results of studies evaluating the relationship between chemical relaxer use and CCCA have varied. The survey study of African-American women described above did not find statistically significant associations between CCCA and chemical relaxer use or hot comb use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], nor did a study of 326 African-American women volunteers that based a diagnosis of &quot;probable CCCA&quot; on physical examination findings alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In contrast, the authors of a study of 39 women who presented to a university-based clinic for hair loss in Nigeria (including 20 women with cicatricial alopecia) suggested an association between chemical relaxers and CCCA based upon a finding that women who reported prolonged and frequent use of chemical relaxers were more likely to have features of cicatricial alopecia on physical examination than those who reported lesser use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, the acute development of scarring alopecia in patients who developed persistent discomfort after application of a chemical relaxer has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H375355\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of genetic factors in the development of CCCA is unclear. The possibility of a genetic contribution is suggested by reports of familial cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and a South African study of 14 families that suggested an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with partial penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, environmental factors such as shared hair care practices within a family are also potential contributors. Further studies are necessary to clarify whether there is a heritable component to this disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498791\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A study of 326 African-American female volunteers found a significantly greater prevalence of type 2 diabetes and bacterial scalp infections in women with CCCA than women without CCCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, the authors of a survey study of 38 women with CCCA suggested an association with androgen-related disorders based upon a relatively high prevalence of acne, facial hair, and irregular menses in the study population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. An association with uterine leiomyomas has also been suggested by a single institution study including 447 women with CCCA and over 16,000 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this study, the prevalence of uterine leiomyomas was higher among women with CCCA than those without CCCA (14 versus 3 percent; odds ratio 4.68, 95% CI 3.57-6.12). However, further study is needed to confirm these associations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12560754\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) begins as a subtle patch of partial hair thinning on the midline of the crown of the scalp or vertex of the scalp (ie, posterior portion of the crown or hair whorl zone) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91649\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91649 \">picture 1A</a>). With the passage of time, the severity of hair loss increases and the zone of involvement widens in a centrifugal fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although the <span class=\"nowrap\">crown/vertex</span> is most typically involved in a symmetrical fashion, atypical distributions of hair loss have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Because most patients seek out medical care several years after they first note hair loss, clinicians seldom encounter truly &quot;early&quot; disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Hair loss from CCCA always is most severe in the center of the expanding patch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91650\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91650 \">picture 1B</a>). Careful examination will reveal loss of follicular ostia between residual hair shafts (a clinical finding characteristic of cicatricial alopecia), although sweat ducts remain intact. Magnification with a dermatoscope is valuable in confirming this finding. In addition, confetti-like or blotchy hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation are often seen, especially in severe cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91652\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91652 \">picture 1C</a>). Perifollicular erythema and tufted hairs also may be present. </p><p>The degree of visible active inflammation, as evidenced by perifollicular erythema and scaling, follicular papules, or pustules, is highly variable from one patient to another. CCCA exhibits a &quot;spectrum of inflammation&quot; ranging from seemingly noninflammatory disease resembling common balding to highly inflammatory, papulopustular disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91651\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91651 \">picture 1D</a>). Whether there is a distinction between highly inflammatory CCCA and folliculitis decalvans is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2177992\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p>Many patients with CCCA note scalp symptoms localized to the area of involvement, including pain, tenderness, itching, or other dysesthesias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/2,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,23</a>]. However, patients may be asymptomatic, even in the presence of extensive hair loss.</p><p>Unexplained hair breakage may be an early sign of CCCA. A retrospective study of nine patients who presented with hair breakage unaccompanied by pruritus, erythema, or scalp tenderness found histologic findings consistent with CCCA in five of the eight patients with histologic samples adequate for complete evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Of the remaining three patients, two showed only premature desquamation of the inner root sheath (a finding suggestive of early CCCA), and one had normal biopsy findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12560761\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The very earliest histologic abnormality that can be appreciated in central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is <strong>premature desquamation of the inner root sheath (PDIRS)</strong>, a feature that usually can be found in at least some of the follicles sampled (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91787\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91787 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25</a>]. PDIRS is not unique to CCCA and can be detected in other forms of inflammatory cicatricial alopecia, especially when follicles are severely inflamed or damaged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. However, when noninflamed or only slightly inflamed follicles demonstrate PDIRS, this feature is very characteristic of CCCA. </p><p>In the zone of alopecia, follicles with PDIRS eventually develop <strong>eccentric thinning of the follicular epithelium</strong> at the level of isthmus and lower infundibulum. In concert with this finding, affected follicles develop <strong>perifollicular concentric lamellar (&quot;onion skin&quot;) fibroplasia</strong> and <strong>perifollicular lymphocytic inflammation</strong>, again most prominent in the isthmus and lower infundibulum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91788\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91788 \">picture 6</a>). </p><p>Although CCCA was classified as a lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia in the North American Hair Research Society workshop on cicatricial alopecia based upon the frequent detection of a lymphocyte-predominant infiltrate in this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], other types of inflammatory cells can be present, particularly in patients with inflammatory disease demonstrating papules, pustules, tufting of hairs, or confluent erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91789\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91789 \">picture 3</a>). Histology of papular or pustular areas will usually show a mixture of acute and chronic inflammatory cells, with varying proportions of neutrophils, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. In contrast, if less-inflamed skin at the border of the affected area is sampled, the predominating histologic findings will be the follicular changes and perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate observed in more typical cases of CCCA.</p><p>Unlike discoid lupus erythematosus and lichen planopilaris, clear-cut vacuolar interface alteration of the follicular epithelium is not found in affected follicles in CCCA. In addition, artifactual clefting between follicular epithelium and stroma is seen only when the follicular epithelium becomes markedly thinned and inflamed. This contrasts with lichen planopilaris, in which <span class=\"nowrap\">epithelial/stromal</span> clefting is an early histologic finding. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12560775\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suspicion for a diagnosis of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) should arise in a patient with clinical findings of a centrifugally expanding area of alopecia on the central scalp, especially when the patient is a woman of African descent. There are no established criteria for the diagnosis of CCCA. The diagnosis is made when the sum of clinical and histologic findings are more consistent with CCCA than other forms of alopecia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H375856\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient history and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all patients presenting with hair loss, a careful patient history is an important component of the patient evaluation. The history can be very helpful for ruling out other hair disorders and narrowing the differential diagnosis. In general, patients should be asked about the duration of hair loss, progression of hair loss, associated symptoms, medical disorders, medications, dietary changes, and hair care practices. The approach to interviewing patients with hair loss is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H638334\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Patient interview'</a>.)</p><p>In particular, because of the potential for a role of hair care practices in the development of CCCA, a thorough history of hair care practices should be obtained and documented. We inquire about current and prior use of chemical hair relaxers, permanent waves, braided styles (with or without extensions), hair weaves (both sew-in and glued), and heat techniques for straightening hair (eg, hot combs or flat irons).</p><p>The physical examination should include a careful examination of the hair and scalp in which both the hair shafts and the scalp skin are carefully examined. Hairpieces and hair extensions should be removed to allow for a thorough examination. Although CCCA is limited to the scalp, performing a full skin examination at the time of initial evaluation also is recommended to aid in the detection of physical findings suggestive of a different hair disorder.

Histologic findings that support CCCA include permanent loss of follicles, premature desquamation of the inner root sheath, concentric lamellar fibroplasia at the level of the follicular isthmus and lower infundibulum, perifollicular chronic inflammation, and the absence of vacuolar changes at the epidermal basal cell layer. (See <a href=\"#H12560761\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p>The site for the biopsy should be chosen carefully to optimize the likelihood of identifying diagnostic findings. The most dependable biopsy site is a location at the periphery of the area of alopecia. The biopsy site should not be completely devoid of hair. Papules and pustules should be avoided. Some dermatopathologists prefer to receive two biopsy specimens when evaluating alopecia to allow for examination of tissue in both vertical and horizontal sections; however, we find that a single biopsy specimen sectioned horizontally usually is sufficient for the diagnosis of CCCA. </p><p>In patients in whom hair loss is due to more than one cause, the biopsy site may demonstrate findings of CCCA and another form of alopecia.

Dermoscopic examination revealed a peripilar white halo in 94 percent of patients with CCCA and was highly specific for the diagnosis of CCCA. In addition, visualization of a peripilar white halo on dermoscopic examination of the biopsy site correlated with the detection of perifollicular concentric fibrosis on histologic examination. Further study will be useful for clarifying the role of dermoscopy in the diagnosis of CCCA.

Active disease typically demonstrates erythematous scaly plaques and follicular plugging. Marked pigmentary alteration often occurs in sites of DLE, resulting in hypopigmented, hyperpigmented, or depigmented macules and patches. The classic histologic findings of DLE differ from those of CCCA and include interface dermatitis, a superficial and deep lymphocytic infiltrate, and thickening of the basement membrane. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-lupus-erythematosus#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Discoid lupus erythematosus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lichen planopilaris </strong>&ndash; Lichen planopilaris a form of cicatricial alopecia that is characterized by perifollicular erythema, perifollicular scale, and multiple smooth alopecic patches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90009\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90009 \">picture 8</a>).

The key feature that distinguishes female pattern hair loss from CCCA is the absence of scarring, a finding suggested by the retention of visible follicular ostia. Biopsy can be useful to distinguish these conditions; histologic examination of a site of female pattern hair loss will reveal an increased number of miniaturized hair follicles.

Although some hair regrowth can occur in sites of alopecia secondary to CCCA, hair will not regrow from follicles that have been permanently damaged by the disease process. <strong>Thus,</strong> <strong>initiating treatment in the early stages of disease is critical for maximizing the likelihood of successful treatment. </strong></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87233182\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to a lack of data on the efficacy of treatments for CCCA, support for various treatments is largely derived from the recommendations of clinicians experienced in the treatment of hair and scalp disease. Local corticosteroid therapy and oral tetracyclines, both well-tolerated therapies with antiinflammatory properties, are well-accepted and commonly used first-line treatments for CCCA. The approach to treatment reviewed here reflects our approach to CCCA. Other approaches to treatment may be reasonable.</p><p>In general, the response of CCCA to local and systemic therapies is slow. At least six months of treatment usually is required to assess the efficacy of a particular treatment. Once a satisfactory response is obtained, treatment can be slowly tapered as tolerated. Subsequently, patients should be followed periodically for recurrence of active disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7677286\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are most likely to benefit from pharmacologic treatments for CCCA are those with active disease.

Because no treatment can regenerate hair follicles that have been destroyed by the disease process, long-standing disease with a large area of involvement seldom achieves much regrowth of hair. A careful discussion with the patient about the expected results will help to avoid unrealistic expectations for treatment. The discussion should be performed in a sensitive and empathetic manner because for many patients, hair loss is a psychologically distressing condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2178557\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our first-line therapy for CCCA consists of antiinflammatory therapies that are usually well-tolerated by patients. For patients with mild involvement (small, non-disfiguring area of hair loss, slow progression, and minimal clinical signs of inflammation), we typically begin treatment with a topical corticosteroid alone or combined with intralesional corticosteroid therapy. For patients with more extensive disease, we usually add an oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> to these therapies. (See <a href=\"#H2178429\" class=\"local\">'Local corticosteroids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2178435\" class=\"local\">'Oral tetracyclines'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to pharmacologic interventions, we encourage our patients with CCCA to avoid or reduce potentially harmful hair care practices.

We typically treat patients with topical corticosteroid therapy, and use intralesional corticosteroid injections as an adjunctive treatment for those patients who demonstrate prominent clinical signs of inflammatory disease (ie, papules, pustules, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> erythema). An initial response to local corticosteroid therapy is usually prompt (within a few weeks), but it may take several months for complete control (resolution of symptoms, resolution of signs of inflammation, and cessation of progression of hair loss) to be achieved. </p><p>Patients are instructed to apply a high potency topical corticosteroid (group 1 or 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) daily to the affected area and the periphery. The patient&rsquo;s preference for a vehicle should be considered. While some patients prefer a topical corticosteroid in an ointment form, others may prefer a gel, foam, or solution. The potency of the topical corticosteroid can be tapered once the patient achieves satisfactory improvement. We usually continue some degree of topical corticosteroid therapy for at least one year because our experience is that relapse commonly occurs when treatment is abruptly discontinued. </p><p>When we supplement topical corticosteroids with intralesional corticosteroid injections, we perform intralesional corticosteroid therapy every four to six weeks for up to six months, injecting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide (5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 1% without epinephrine used as a diluent) into the periphery of the area of alopecia.

When this occurs, we discontinue injections until atrophy resolves (usually several months). Other adverse effects of topical and intralesional corticosteroid therapy are reviewed in greater detail separately.

Our patients with mild disease who fail to respond to local corticosteroid therapy alone are also given a trial of antibiotic therapy.

Other authors have utilized doses of 100 mg twice daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Combination therapy with local corticosteroid therapy and an oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> is continued until all clinical signs of active disease have resolved. Once this has been achieved (typically two to six months), the potency of the topical corticosteroid is gradually reduced, and the dose of the oral antibiotic is decreased (usually by 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H12560747\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of alternative terms were used to refer to CCCA in the past. Examples include hot comb alopecia, follicular degeneration syndrome, chemically induced cosmetic alopecia, and central centrifugal scarring alopecia. (See <a href=\"#H2177992\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of CCCA is not well understood and the inciting factors are unclear. One theory suggests that premature desquamation of the inner root sheath of hair follicles is a precipitating event (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91787\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91787 \">picture 2</a>). Although certain hair care practices that can be damaging to the hair and scalp have been proposed as inciting factors for CCCA, a relationship between hair care practices and CCCA remains to be proven. (See <a href=\"#H2178401\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2178281\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CCCA usually begins as a subtle patch of partial hair thinning on the crown or vertex of the scalp. Over time, the zone of hair loss expands in a centrifugal pattern, with the most severe hair loss remaining in the center (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91649%7EDERM%2F91650%7EDERM%2F91652%7EDERM%2F91651\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91649 graphicRef91650 graphicRef91652 graphicRef91651 \">picture 1A-D</a>). Clinical signs of inflammation such as papules, pustules, erythema, and scale may or may not be present. The presence of pain, itching, tenderness, or other dysesthesias in the involved area is variable. (See <a href=\"#H12560754\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of CCCA should be suspected in patients who present with centrifugally expanding hair loss on the central scalp, particularly when the patient is a woman of African descent. Because other forms of alopecia may clinically resemble CCCA, performance of a scalp biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H12560775\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7536344\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data are limited on the treatment of CCCA and there are no established treatment guidelines. Support for the various treatment options for CCCA is primarily derived from the recommendations of clinicians experienced in the treatment of hair and scalp disease. (See <a href=\"#H12560788\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild CCCA (small area of hair loss, slow progression, and minimal clinical signs of inflammation), we suggest initial treatment with a high potency topical corticosteroid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with more extensive disease (or with mild disease that fails to respond to corticosteroid therapy alone), we suggest the addition of an oral tetracycline-class antibiotic to this regimen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Our experience suggests that intralesional corticosteroid injection may be a useful adjunct to these therapies, particularly in patients with visible signs of inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H2178557\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional treatments that have been used for CCCA that does not respond to standard therapy include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, immunosuppressants, and for highly inflammatory disease, combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>.
