The incidence of HL in childhood varies by age such that HL is exceedingly rare in infants, but is the most common childhood cancer in the 15- to 19-year-old age group. Children and adolescents with HL have a five-year survival of 94 percent since 2002 compared with an 81 percent survival in the early 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Few risk factors, other than those related to viral exposure and immune function, have been convincingly identified.

The pathobiology of HL and its diagnosis and management in adults are presented separately as is the care of the adult survivor of HL.

In the United States and other economically advantaged countries, two incidence peaks exist: one in young adults and one in persons older than 50 years; most patients are young adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62585\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62585 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. The estimated age-related incidence rates are 29 cases per million per year in adolescents aged 15 to 19; approximately 10 per million per year in 10- to 14-year-olds; 3.5 per million in five- to nine-year-olds; and one per million for ages zero to four years. The bimodal age distribution of HL is different in economically disadvantaged areas. An initial peak occurs in childhood for boys, relatively low rates are found in young adults, and a late peak occurs in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The incidence of HL is similar among White and African-American children younger than 10 years of age, but is increased among White children relative to African Americans older than 10 years (ratio of 1.4:1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial HL has been estimated to represent 4.5 percent of all cases of HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. This familial association may include shared environmental factors, exposure to viruses, and genetic influences, including inherited immunodeficiency states.

The rest of the lymph node contains a heterogeneous cellular infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, eosinophils, macrophages, plasma cells, and fibroblasts. HRS cells are germinal center B cells that cannot synthesize immunoglobulin molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The infiltrating cells secrete an array of cytokines and chemokines that are important for HRS cell survival and maintenance of the characteristic cellular infiltrate. The biology of HRS cells and their role in HL are discussed separately.

Twenty-five to 50 percent of cases of classical HL in developed countries are EBV positive; the incidence of EBV varies among histological subtypes.

The affected lymph nodes typically feel rubbery and more firm than inflammatory adenopathy; they may be sensitive to palpation if they have grown rapidly. &quot;Bulky lymphadenopathy&quot; (aggregates of lymph nodes &ge;6 cm in diameter) are considered in the risk stratification for therapy.

They are more common among children older than 12 years of age, in whom approximately 30 percent have masses greater than one-third the diameter of the intrathoracic cavity. Such &quot;bulky&quot; mediastinal disease may cause dysphagia, dyspnea, cough, stridor, or the superior vena cava syndrome.

Fine needle aspirates do <strong>not</strong> provide adequate amounts of material for proper histologic classification nor for molecular studies needed in the evaluation of other lymphomas. Subclassification of HL depends upon whether the tumoral architecture is nodular, diffuse, or both, and whether &quot;classic&quot; or variant Reed-Sternberg cells are present, as well as the composition of the cellular infiltrate (eg, non-neoplastic small lymphocytes, eosinophils, plasma cells, fibroblasts, histiocytes, neutrophils, and collagen fibers).

As patients with HL were living longer, side effects from the chemotherapy, such as cardiopulmonary toxicity and second malignancies, emerged as a competing cause of delayed mortality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71648\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71648 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/91,93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,93-95</a>]. The combined modality therapy regimens that are currently given were designed to be less intensive than the early therapies in an effort to decrease the incidence of adverse late effects.

One study evaluated late mortality among over 34,000 survivors of childhood cancer treated from 1970 through 1999 with a median follow-up of 21 years, including 4332 patients who had survived at least five years after a diagnosis of childhood HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. In the group as a whole, later decades demonstrated a significant decline in mortality rates, reflecting fewer deaths due to recurrence and long-term toxicities. Among five-year survivors of childhood HL treated in the most recent decade (1990 to 1994), an estimated 5.8 percent died within 15 years, with the cause of death evenly split between progression (2.7 percent) and long-term toxicities (2.6 percent). The most common causes of treatment-related mortality included subsequent neoplasm (1.3 percent at 15 years), cardiac toxicity (0.5 percent at 15 years), and pulmonary toxicity (0.5 percent at 15 years).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h3\">Growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term effects on bone and soft-tissue growth among survivors of childhood HL are related to the dose and volume of received radiation, as well as the age of the child when the radiation was administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

Measurement of serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and sex steroid levels (testosterone or estradiol) should be performed in children with delayed or interrupted progression of puberty.

Approximately half of these long-term survivors had at least one live birth (406 children born to 228 survivors). For those younger than age 40, the likelihood of a successful full-term pregnancy was similar to an age-matched German population. Factors associated with a decreased likelihood of successful pregnancy included age over 40 years and receipt of pelvic radiation.

In one study of 1279 persons with HL treated with mediastinal irradiation and followed for a median of 14.7 years, estimated cumulative incidence rates of clinically significant cardiac disease were 2, 5, 10, 16, and 23 percent at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].

The incidence of HL in childhood varies by age such that HL is exceedingly rare in infants, but is the most common childhood cancer in the 15- to 19-year-old age group.
