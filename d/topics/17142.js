Compared with patients in the lowest quintile, those in the highest quintile of Western-type dietary intake had a greater risk of recurrence (HR 2.85, 95% CI 1.75-4.63) and death (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.36-3.96) on multivariate analyses.

This is likely due to the greater likelihood of developing an estrogen-responsive tumor in women with a higher level of circulating estrogen. Accordingly, severely obese women were also more likely to present with stage I disease (77 versus 61 percent) or low-grade tumors (44 versus 24 percent).</p><p>Despite this, among women with endometrial carcinoma, obesity is associated with an increased risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-roles-of-diet-physical-activity-and-body-weight-in-cancer-survivorship/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The magnitude of this risk was illustrated in a prospective cohort study of 495,477 women followed for 16 years in the Cancer Prevention Study II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-roles-of-diet-physical-activity-and-body-weight-in-cancer-survivorship/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The risk of dying from endometrial carcinoma among those with the highest BMI (&ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> was 6.25-fold higher than that of normal-weight women (BMI 18.5 to 24.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102010331\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL LIFESTYLE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Cancer Society (ACS) and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) have developed nutrition and physical activity guidelines for cancer survivors based on the available evidence linking diet, weight, and physical activity to cancer outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-roles-of-diet-physical-activity-and-body-weight-in-cancer-survivorship/abstract/34,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,84</a>]. In addition, while The American Society of Clinical Oncology advocates secondary prevention including maintenance of healthy body weight and adoption of an active lifestyle specifically for colorectal cancer survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-roles-of-diet-physical-activity-and-body-weight-in-cancer-survivorship/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>], these guidelines should be considered universally by all survivors.</p><p>Key points of the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACS/ACSM</span> recommendations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain a healthy weight and attempt weight loss if overweight or obese</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adopt a physically active lifestyle engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity on five or more days of the week</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consume a healthy diet, with at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day and limited ingestion of processed foods and red meats</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit alcohol to no more than one <span class=\"nowrap\">drink/day</span> for women and two <span class=\"nowrap\">drinks/day</span> for men (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the risks and benefits of alcohol consumption&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102010488\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With advances in early detection and treatments for cancer, there are over 25 million people alive with a history of cancer. Novel methods to improve outcomes, especially those that are also associated with improvements in quality of life and other health benefits, may offer attractive additions to the currently available treatment options. (See <a href=\"#H86925732\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diet, physical activity, and weight are collectively considered energy balance factors because they describe the relationship between energy consumed (diet), energy expended (physical activity), and energy stored (adiposity). They have each been linked to cancer outcomes, particularly in survivors with breast, colon, endometrial, and prostate cancer. (See <a href=\"#H86925732\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary intakes have been linked to outcomes in some cancers. However, there are few randomized trials testing the impact of dietary change on cancer outcomes. The Women&rsquo;s Interventional Nutrition Study (WINS) trial demonstrated a 24 percent reduction in breast cancer recurrence in women randomized to a low-fat dietary intervention, but the Women&rsquo;s Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) trial showed no impact of a <span class=\"nowrap\">low-fat/high-fruit</span> and vegetable diet upon prognosis in a similar group of breast cancer survivors. Further prospective evaluation is needed. (See <a href=\"#H435221609\" class=\"local\">'Diet'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observational studies have shown an association between physical activity patterns after cancer diagnosis and prognosis in individuals diagnosed with early-stage cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate. However, there are no data from randomized trials to date testing the impact of increased physical activity on rates of cancer recurrence or mortality. (See <a href=\"#H435220049\" class=\"local\">'Physical activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple interventional studies have evaluated the safety, feasibility, and benefits of exercise in cancer survivors. The benefits include a reduction in fatigue, improvement in quality of life, and improvements in fitness and physical functioning. (See <a href=\"#H435220049\" class=\"local\">'Physical activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity (defined as a body mass index [BMI] &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> is associated with an increased risk of developing most common cancers. Obesity at diagnosis is also associated with an increased mortality risk in women with early-stage breast cancer as well as potentially in men with prostate cancer and individuals with colorectal cancer. The American Society of Clinical Oncology made Obesity and Cancer one of its core initiatives in 2013. The initiative focuses on building awareness, fostering research, and advocating for access to evidence-based weight management programs for cancer survivors. (See <a href=\"#H435222400\" class=\"local\">'Weight'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Cancer Society and the American College of Sports Medicine have developed energy balance guidelines for cancer survivors that recommend maintaining a healthy weight, adopting a physically active lifestyle (ie, engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity on five or more days of the week), and eating a healthy diet rich in plant sources. (See <a href=\"#H102010331\" class=\"local\">'Clinical lifestyle recommendations for cancer survivors'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-roles-of-diet-physical-activity-and-body-weight-in-cancer-survivorship/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fair AM, Montgomery K.
