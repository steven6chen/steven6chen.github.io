Although the side effect liability of these drugs is significant and they are inherently associated with the serious problems of drug abuse and addiction, experience in the management of cancer pain indicates that they can potentially be used safely and effectively for all types of pain (ie, somatic, visceral, neuropathic). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &ldquo;chronic non-cancer pain&rdquo; is ill defined but generally understood to apply to common types of musculoskeletal pain syndromes, such as arthritis and low back pain, and to headache. The long-term use of opioid drugs for these conditions is more controversial. For patients with chronic non-cancer pain, the decision to begin opioid therapy must be weighed carefully.

This applies to opioid use of any type in any population.</p><p>Opioid therapy is associated with numerous side effects, the most common of which are gastrointestinal or neurological. There is marked interindividual variability in the sensitivity to adverse effects from opioids, which may be due to genetic differences, age, comorbidity, or interactions with other drugs. The assessment and management of side effects is a best practice during opioid therapy. In many cases, however, a favorable balance between analgesia and side effects cannot be attained, a situation that may be termed &ldquo;poor responsiveness.&rdquo; When a patient undergoing dose titration is determined be poorly responsive to a specific opioid, there are several approaches to consider: improving the symptomatic management of the dose-limiting side effect, changing to an alternative opioid (opioid rotation), or adding another therapy (a nonopioid analgesic, an adjuvant analgesic, or a nonpharmacological treatment) that may improve analgesia even as the opioid dose is lowered.</p><p>This topic review will cover the prevention and management of specific adverse events in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy. Management of side effects in patients receiving opioid therapy for acute pain in the postoperative or acute critical illness settings is discussed elsewhere.

The usual effects include increased segmental motility and decreased peristalsis. The outcome usually is manifest as constipation. Nausea, bloating, early satiety, and pain are also possible.&nbsp;Occasionally, patients develop ileus or a syndrome characterized by a relatively high level of abdominal pain.&nbsp;When pain is significant, the term &ldquo;narcotic bowel syndrome&rdquo; has sometimes been applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The etiology of pain is unknown and may be related to the interaction between increased nonpropulsive motility and visceral hyperalgesia, such as what occurs in functional gastrointestinal disorders.&nbsp;Although theoretically this syndrome could be related to opioid-induced hyperalgesia, there is no evidence linking them to the same processes.

A careful anorectal examination can identify structural issues and fecal impaction. </p><p>Few data are available regarding the clinical utility of tests in suspected OIC. If clinically indicated, simple laboratory tests (eg, complete blood count, serum calcium, thyroid stimulating hormone) are reasonable. An abdominal plain radiograph can identify fecal impaction and the level of stool burden. Occasionally, colonoscopy is indicated to assess a possible coexisting intraluminal lesion.

All patients with predisposing factors (eg, advanced age, immobility, poor diet, intra-abdominal pathology, neuropathy, hypercalcemia, concurrent use of other constipating drugs) should be considered for prophylactic laxative therapy when opioid treatment is initiated. Conventionally, this is accomplished with a contact cathartic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=senna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">senna</a>, 2 tablets at bedtime), with or without a stool softener (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docusate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docusate</a> 100 mg orally twice daily), or daily administration of an osmotic laxative (eg, polyethylene glycol 17 g [one heaping tablespoon]) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a> (30 mL). All patients should be encouraged to increase fluid intake, mobility, and dietary fiber (unless severely debilitated with limited oral fluid intake, or bowel obstruction is suspected). In addition, comfort and privacy for defecation must be ensured (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60646 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>There are numerous options for laxative therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73845\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73845 \">table 2</a>) and no data to suggest that any one approach is superior to any other. In a Cochrane systematic review of management of OIC in a population with advanced illness, four randomized trials comparing different kinds of laxatives showed no significant differences among them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The specific approach selected should be consistent with patient preference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60646 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Previously, it was common to use a stool softener in conjunction with a laxative, but studies now suggest that it need not be included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is little evidence to support the use of surfactant agents in chronic constipation. Stool softeners, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docusate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docusate</a> sodium, are intended to lower the surface tension of stool, thereby allowing water to more easily enter the stool. Although these agents have few side effects, they are less effective than other laxatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The patient can be switched from one conventional therapy to another (eg, from a contact cathartic to an osmotic cathartic or vice versa), and dose escalation can be considered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60646 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Some patients with mild OIC are able to improve bowel function by dietary modifications, including increased consumption of fluids and dietary fiber. Fiber should be discontinued, however, if the patient is debilitated, bowel obstruction is suspected, or hydration has been difficult to maintain. These factors may predispose to the worsening of obstructive symptoms when fiber is introduced into the diet.</p><p>Patients who have passed no stool in several days and who have no evidence of bowel obstruction or ileus are likely to be impacted. It is often possible to clear the rectal vault and lower sigmoid colon with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a> enema followed by an irritant enema, but manual disimpaction may be required.

Some of these treatments, including the opioid antagonists and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lubiprostone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lubiprostone</a>, are supported by high-quality evidence and are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for this indication.</p><p>Consensus-based recommendations for quantifying OIC and when to initiate prescription therapies for OIC are available from the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM) and endorsed by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

However, in the clinical setting, the decision to proceed to a trial of a prescription drug for OIC is more typically based on a broader assessment, which may include factors as varied as the patient&rsquo;s level of constipation-associated distress, psychological reaction to the possibility of another over-the-counter strategy, and extent of insurance coverage for the cost of prescription medications. Given the large number of over-the-counter treatments, which may be tried in combination and at varied doses, the decision to label the patient&rsquo;s symptoms as &ldquo;refractory&rdquo; and proceed to a prescription-based approach is ultimately determined through discussion with the patient about the burdens, risks, and costs associated with the next trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372619437\"><span class=\"h4\">Opioid antagonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs) are an evidence-based treatment for refractory OIC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In this population, mood disturbance is more often negative (irritability, depressed mood, dysphoria) than positive (contentment, euphoria).</p><p>The incidence of cognitive dysfunction in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy is not well characterized.

Opioid therapy can also be associated with the development of a central or mixed syndrome, even in those without known predisposing factors. Patients with risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea, a history of snoring, or co-administered centrally acting drugs, particularly the benzodiazepines, should be treated cautiously and with careful monitoring.

Although solid evidence for the existence of OIH in patients with chronic non-cancer or cancer-related pain is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>], clinical observations suggest that it may be important, at least in some patients or some clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain/abstract/113,114,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">113,114,118</a>].</p><p>When individual patients demonstrate a loss of opioid effect in the absence of progressive illness (ie, develop analgesic tolerance), or develop a syndrome of worsening or more-diffuse pain with tremulousness and, possibly, confusion during a period of aggressive opioid escalation, an element of OIH may be occurring. Diagnosis may be complicated if this occurs in association with delirium and the patient is observed to become seemingly more distressed by pain as extra boluses of opioids are given. The diagnosis of OIH (and possibly delirium) should be considered in all patients with worsening or more-diffuse pain during a period of aggressive opioid escalation. </p><p>There is no well-established treatment for OIH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. When suspected, it is reasonable to consider opioid rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>] or the use of a nonopioid strategy for pain control. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H895629775\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Side effect management is a best practice during opioid therapy. When a patient undergoing dose titration who cannot achieve a favorable balance between analgesia and side effects is determined be poorly responsive to a specific opioid, there are several approaches to consider: improving the symptomatic management of the dose-limiting side effect, changing to an alternative opioid (opioid rotation), or adding another therapy (a nonopioid analgesic, an adjuvant analgesic, or a nonpharmacological treatment) that may improve analgesia even as the opioid dose is lowered. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Opioid-induced constipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common and persistent side effect from chronic opioid use is constipation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Opioid bowel dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is based on clinical history, physical examination (including rectal examination), and limited diagnostic studies, as clinically indicated. Diagnostic criteria for OIC are available (the Rome-IV criteria). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention is preferred over management of OIC. For all patients with predisposing factors, including advanced age, immobility, poor diet, intra-abdominal pathology, neuropathy, hypercalcemia, or use of other constipating drugs, we suggest prophylactic therapy when opioid treatment is initiated (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Conventionally, this is accomplished with a contact cathartic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=senna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">senna</a>, two tablets at bedtime), with or without a stool softener (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docusate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docusate</a> 100 mg orally twice daily), or daily administration of an osmotic laxative (eg, polyethylene glycol 17 g [one heaping tablespoon]) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a> (30 mL), except if lactose intolerant. All patients should be encouraged to increase fluid intake, mobility, and dietary fiber (unless severely debilitated with limited oral fluid intake, or bowel obstruction is suspected). In addition, comfort and privacy for defecation must be ensured (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60646 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3695326310\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who develop OIC despite a prophylactic regimen, before proceeding to an approach typically considered for refractory cases, the conventional starting strategies can be switched (eg, from a contact cathartic to an osmotic cathartic or vice versa), and dose escalation can be considered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60646 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some patients also are able to improve bowel function by dietary modifications (increased consumption of fluids and soluble dietary fiber) and increased physical activity. Fiber should not be increased if the patient is debilitated, bowel obstruction is suspected, or hydration has been difficult to maintain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular ingestion of probiotics can improve chronic constipation; given the safety of these therapies, a trial in patients with OIC is reasonable. (See <a href=\"#H784234588\" class=\"local\">'Other therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For refractory cases, there are numerous approaches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73845\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73845 \">table 2</a>), including opioid receptor antagonist therapy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lubiprostone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lubiprostone</a>, which are specifically approved for this indication. For most patients, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylnaltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylnaltrexone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). If an oral agent is preferred; options include the opioid antagonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxegol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxegol</a>, oral methylnaltrexone, or where available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naldemedine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naldemedine</a>. Clinicians should use caution when administering opioid antagonists to patients with known or suspected lesions in the intestinal wall, given the rare serious side effects observed with methylnaltrexone, and should stop the drug immediately for worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Management of refractory cases'</a> above). Another alternative is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linaclotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linaclotide</a>, a guanylyl cyclase C agonist, which is approved for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and chronic idiopathic constipation. (See <a href=\"#H784234588\" class=\"local\">'Other therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4149673465\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedation and mental clouding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioid therapy can cause somnolence or mental clouding, which typically wanes over a period of days or weeks but is persistent in some patients. The severity is widely variable. A stepwise approach to treatment includes the following (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Somnolence and mental clouding'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obvious contributing causes should be treated if feasible and consistent with the goals of care. Concomitant use of centrally acting medications, especially central nervous system depressants, should be reduced or eliminated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If analgesia is satisfactory, an empiric trial of opioid dose reduction is a reasonable first step. If analgesia is unsatisfactory, opioid rotation may be beneficial, or coanalgesics may be initiated or increased in order to achieve an opioid-sparing effect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As an alternative strategy, we suggest an empiric trial of a psychostimulant (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a>.

Opioid rotation or a change in the route of administration is a reasonable approach to persistent opioid-induced nausea and vomiting. For patients who do not respond to opioid rotation, it seems reasonable to initiate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a> and to switch to an atypical antipsychotic, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>, in refractory cases. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Nausea and vomiting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myoclonus is a spasm of certain muscle groups that is typically associated with high doses of opioids. Therapeutic options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> 0.5 mg orally every six to eight hours, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> 0.5 to 1 mg orally, sublingually, or intravenously every two to three hours, an anticonvulsant, or opioid rotation. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Myoclonus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioids can cause hypogonadism. When clinically appropriate to address side effects that could be associated with low levels of sex hormones, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> or estradiol can be measured, and low levels can be treated. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Neuroendocrine effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioids can worsen preexisting sleep apnea syndrome, precipitate obstructive sleep apnea in those predisposed by conditions such as obesity, or cause a syndrome of central or mixed sleep apnea, even in those without predisposing factors. Treatment should be carefully monitored in those suspected of sleep apnea. If the clinical setting is appropriate, the patient with sleep-related symptoms or daytime somnolence can undergo further evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Sleep-disordered breathing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory depression is commonly considered a serious adverse effect of opioid drugs, but it is rarely a problem when therapy is administered according to accepted guidelines. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Naloxone</a> &ldquo;pens&rdquo; and inhalers are now being marketed so that friends, families, and professionals can intervene in an emergency, should serious opioid-induced respiratory depression occur. Patients and families should discuss with the physician whether it would be appropriate and beneficial for the patient to receive one of these devices to have at home during opioid treatment for chronic pain. (See <a href=\"#H3871239225\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory depression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioid-induced pruritus affects up to 10 percent of patients treated with opioids. Options for management include antihistamines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>, or opioid rotation. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Pruritus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The phenomenon of opioid-induced hyperalgesia should be considered in the individual patient who demonstrates worsening pain with tremulousness, and possibly generalized allodynia and confusion, as the opioid dose is aggressively escalated, especially if there is no evidence of rapidly progressive illness or new pathology. Therapeutic options include opioid rotation or a switch to a nonopioid analgesic.
