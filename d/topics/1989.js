Gastrointestinal perforation/fistula: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: GI perforation, (sometimes fatal) in patients receiving bevacizumab products ranges from 0.3% to 3%; discontinue bevacizumab products in patients with GI perforation.</b> A higher incidence of GI perforation is associated with a history of prior pelvic radiation. Most cases of GI perforation occurred within 50 days of the first bevacizumab dose. Perforation may be complicated by intra-abdominal abscess, fistula formation, and/or diverting ostomy requirement. Serious fistulae (including tracheoesophageal, bronchopleural, biliary, vaginal, renal, and bladder fistulas) have been reported at a higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab products (compared to patients receiving chemotherapy), with the highest incidence occurring in patients with cervical cancer. Most fistulae occurred within 6 months of the first bevacizumab dose. Patients who develop gastrointestinal vaginal fistula may also have bowel obstruction which requires surgical intervention and diverting ostomy. Avoid bevacizumab products in patients with ovarian cancer with evidence of recto-sigmoid involvement (by pelvic examination) or bowel involvement (on CT scan), or clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction. Discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation, tracheoesophageal fistula, any grade 4 fistula, or fistula formation involving any internal organ.</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Heart failure: In a scientific statement from the American Heart Association, bevacizumab has been determined to be an agent that may either cause reversible direct myocardial toxicity or exacerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction (magnitude: moderate/major) (AHA [Page 2016]). Bevacizumab is not indicated for use in combination with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The incidence of grade &ge;3 left ventricular dysfunction was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to patients who received chemotherapy alone (1% vs 0.6%). Among patients who received prior anthracycline therapy, the incidence of HF was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy, compared to patients who received chemotherapy alone (4% vs 0.6%). In previously untreated patients with hematologic malignancy, the incidence of HF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline were increased in patients receiving bevacizumab with anthracycline-based chemotherapy (compared to patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy alone). The proportion of patients with a LVEF decline (from baseline) of &ge;20% or a decline from baseline of 10% to &lt;50%, was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone (10% vs 5%). Time to onset of left ventricular dysfunction or HF was 1 to 6 months after the first bevacizumab dose in most patients; HF resolved in nearly two-thirds of patients. Discontinue bevacizumab products in patients who develop HF.</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Hemorrhage: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Severe or fatal hemorrhage, including hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematemesis, central nervous system hemorrhage, epistaxis, and vaginal bleeding occur up to 5-fold more frequently in patients receiving bevacizumab products. </b><b>Do not administer bevacizumab products to patients with a recent history of hemoptysis (&ge;2.5 mL blood). Discontinue in patients who develop grade 3 to 4 hemorrhage.</b> Serious or fatal pulmonary hemorrhage has been reported in nearly one-third of patients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with squamous cell histology (not an FDA-approved indication), as well as a small portion of NSCLC with nonsquamous histology; while no cases occurred in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Minor hemorrhages, including grade 1 epistaxis may commonly occur.</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Hypertension: Bevacizumab may cause and/or worsen hypertension. The incidence of severe hypertension in increased with bevacizumab products. Manage hypertension with antihypertensive therapy. Monitor BP every 2 to 3 weeks during bevacizumab treatment and regularly after discontinuation if bevacizumab-induced hypertension occurs or worsens. Withhold bevacizumab treatment in patients with severe hypertension that is uncontrolled with medical management (resume bevacizumab after blood pressure is controlled). Discontinue bevacizumab products in patients who experience a hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Infusion reactions: Infusion reactions (eg, hypertension, hypertensive crisis [associated with neurologic signs/symptoms], wheezing, oxygen desaturation, hypersensitivity [grade 3], chest pain, rigors, headache, diaphoresis) may occur with the first infusion (uncommon); severe reactions were rare. Decrease the infusion rate for mild/clinically insignificant infusion reactions. Interrupt infusion for clinically significant infusion reactions and consider resuming at a slower rate following resolution. Discontinue bevacizumab for severe infusion reaction and administer appropriate medical therapy (eg, epinephrine, corticosteroids, IV antihistamines, bronchodilators, and/or oxygen).</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Mortality: Bevacizumab, in combination with chemotherapy (or biologic therapy), is associated with an increased risk of treatment-related mortality; a higher risk of fatal adverse events was identified in a meta-analysis of 16 trials in which bevacizumab was used for the treatment of various cancers (breast cancer, colorectal cancer, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and renal cell cancer) and compared to chemotherapy alone (Ranpura 2011).</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Necrotizing fasciitis: Cases of necrotizing fasciitis, including fatalities, have been reported in patients receiving bevacizumab, usually secondary to wound healing complications, GI perforation or fistula formation. Discontinue in patients who develop necrotizing fasciitis.</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Ocular adverse events: Serious eye infections and vision loss due to endophthalmitis have been reported from intravitreal administration (off-label use/route).</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ): According to a position paper by the American Association of Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS), medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) has been associated with bisphosphonates and other antiresorptive agents (denosumab), and antiangiogenic agents (eg, bevacizumab, sunitinib) used for the treatment of osteoporosis or malignancy. Antiangiogenic agents, when given concomitantly with antiresorptive agents, are associated with an increased risk of ONJ. Other risk factors for MRONJ include dentoalveolar surgery (eg, tooth extraction, dental implants), preexisting inflammatory dental disease, and concomitant corticosteroid use. The AAOMS suggests that if medically permissible, initiation of antiangiogenic agents for cancer therapy should be delayed until optimal dental health is attained (if extractions are required, antiangiogenesis therapy should delayed until the extraction site has mucosalized or until after adequate osseous healing). Once antiangiogenic therapy for oncologic disease is initiated, procedures that involve direct osseous injury and placement of dental implants should be avoided. Patients developing ONJ during therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon (AAOMS [Ruggiero 2014]). Cases of non-mandibular ONJ has also been reported in pediatric patients who have received bevacizumab (bevacizumab is not approved for use in pediatric patients).</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Ovarian failure: In premenopausal women with solid tumors receiving adjuvant therapy, the incidence of ovarian failure was 34% for bevacizumab with chemotherapy versus 2% for chemotherapy alone. Recovery of ovarian function (resumption of menses, positive serum &beta;-HCG pregnancy test, or FSH level &lt;30 mIU/mL) at all time points in the post-treatment period after bevacizumab discontinuation was demonstrated in approximately one-fifth of females who received bevacizumab. The long-term effects of bevacizumab on fertility are unknown. Females of reproductive potential should be informed of the potential risk of ovarian failure prior to bevacizumab initiation.</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have been reported. Symptoms (which include headache, seizure, confusion, lethargy, blindness and/or other vision, or neurologic disturbances) may occur from 16 hours to 1 year after treatment initiation. PRES may also be associated with mild to severe hypertension. MRI is necessary for confirmation of PRES diagnosis. Discontinue bevacizumab products in patients who develop PRES. Resolution of symptoms usually occurs within days after discontinuation; however, neurologic sequelae may remain. The safety of treatment reinitiation after PRES is not known.</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Proteinuria/nephrotic syndrome: Bevacizumab products are associated with an increased incidence and severity of proteinuria. Grade 3 (urine dipstick 4+ or &gt;3.5 g protein/24 hours) and grade 4 (nephrotic syndrome) proteinuria have occurred in clinical studies. The overall incidence of all grades of proteinuria in one study was 20%. The median onset of proteinuria was 5.6 months (range: 0.5 to 37 months) after bevacizumab initiation and the median time to resolution was ~6 months. Proteinuria remained unresolved in 40% of patients after median follow-up of 11.2 months and required bevacizumab discontinuation in nearly one-third of patients. A pooled analysis from 7 studies found that 5% of patients receiving bevacizumab products in combination with chemotherapy experienced grades 2 to 4 proteinuria (urine dipstick 2+ or &gt;1 g protein/24 hours or nephrotic syndrome), which resolved in nearly three-fourths of patients; bevacizumab was reinitiated in 42% of patients, although nearly half of patients who reinitiated experienced recurrent grades 2 to 4 proteinuria. Nephrotic syndrome has occurred (rarely) in patients receiving bevacizumab, sometimes with fatal outcome. In some cases, kidney biopsy of patients with proteinuria demonstrated findings consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. A large retrospective analysis comparing bevacizumab with chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone found higher rates of serum creatinine elevations (1.5 to 1.9 times baseline) in patients who received bevacizumab; serum creatinine did not return to baseline in approximately one-third of patients who received bevacizumab. Monitor proteinuria (by serial dipstick urine analysis) for proteinuria development or worsening of proteinuria throughout bevacizumab therapy. Further assess with a 24-hour urine collection for &ge;2+ urine dipstick readings. Withhold bevacizumab for proteinuria &ge;2 g/24 hours; resume when &lt;2 g/24 hours. Discontinue bevacizumab products in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome. Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) does not appear to correlate with 24-hour urine protein.</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Thromboembolism: Bevacizumab products are associated with an increased incidence of arterial thromboembolic events (ATE), including cerebral infarction, stroke, MI, TIA, angina, and other ATEs, when used in combination with chemotherapy. The highest incidence of ATE occurred in patients with glioblastoma. History of ATE, diabetes, or &ge;65 years of age may present an even greater risk. Although patients with cancer are already at risk for VTE, a meta-analysis of 15 controlled trials has demonstrated an increased risk for VTE in patients who received bevacizumab (Nalluri 2008). Patients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy had a higher incidence of grade 3 or higher VTE compared to those patients who received chemotherapy alone. Discontinue bevacizumab in patients with severe ATE or grade 4 VTE, including pulmonary embolism.</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Wound healing complications: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: The incidence of wound healing and surgical complications, including serious and fatal complications, is increased in patients receiving bevacizumab products; discontinue in </b><b>patients who develop wound healing complications that require medical intervention. Withhold bevacizumab products at least 28 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer bevacizumab products for at least 28 days after surgery and until the surgical<b> wound is fully healed. </b></b>In a controlled study in which bevacizumab was not administered within 28 days of major surgical procedures, the incidence of wound healing complications (including serious/fatal complications) was higher in patients with mCRC who underwent surgery while receiving bevacizumab compared to patients who did not receive bevacizumab. In a controlled clinical study in patients with relapsed or recurrent glioblastoma, the incidence of wound healing events was higher in patients who received bevacizumab compared to patients who did not receive bevacizumab. In a retrospective review of central venous access device placements (a minor procedure), a greater risk of wound dehiscence was observed when port placement and bevacizumab administration were separated by &lt;14 days (Erinjeri 2011). If possible, it may be more appropriate to wait until at least 6 to 8 weeks after bevacizumab discontinuation for major surgical procedures (Cortes 2012; Gordon 2009).</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:2em;\">\n      <b>\n        <i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Renal impairment: An increase in diastolic and systolic blood pressures were noted in a retrospective review of patients with renal insufficiency (CrCl &le;60 mL/minute) who received bevacizumab for renal cell cancer (Gupta 2011).</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:2em;\">\n      <b>\n        <i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">&bull; Drug-drug interactions: Potentially significant interactions may exist, requiring dose or frequency adjustment, additional monitoring, and/or selection of alternative therapy.

The inhibition of microvascular growth is believed to retard the growth of all tissues (including metastatic tissue).</p></div>\r\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"F140987\" class=\"block phk drugH1Div\"><span class=\"drugH1\">Pharmacodynamics/Kinetics (Adult data unless noted)</span>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:2em;\">Distribution: CV% central volume: 2.9 (22%) L</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:2em;\">Half-life elimination:</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">IV:</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:6em;\">Pediatric patients (age: 1 to 21 years): Median: 11.8 days (range: 4.4 to 14.6 days) (Glade Bender 2008)</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:6em;\">Adults: ~20 days (range: 11 to 50 days)</p>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:4em;\">Intravitreal: ~5 to 10 days (Bakri 2007; Krohne 2008)</p></div>\r\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"F51154010\" class=\"block phksp drugH1Div\"><span class=\"drugH1\">Pharmacodynamics/Kinetics: Additional Considerations</span>\n    <p style=\"text-indent:-2em;margin-left:2em;\">Gender: Men had a higher clearance and larger volume of distribution in the central compartment when compared with women.
