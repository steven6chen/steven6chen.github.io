Invasive measures of diastolic function include the peak instantaneous rate of LV pressure decline <span class=\"nowrap\">(-dP/dt),</span> the time constant of LV relaxation (tau), and the stiffness modulus. Although echocardiography does not directly measure these parameters, echocardiography is the most practical routine clinical approach for evaluating LV diastolic function given clinical and experimental evidence supporting its use as well as its safety, versatility, and portability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diastole is conventionally divided into the following phases: isovolumetric relaxation (both aortic and mitral valves are closed and LV pressure is declining), early LV filling with opening of the mitral valve, a mid-diastolic phase (often noted in patients with bradycardia), and late or atrial filling with left atrial (LA) contraction. In normal hearts, predominant LV filling occurs in early diastole. With impaired LV relaxation, LV filling shifts to late diastole and becomes dependent on LA systolic function. This accounts for the significant clinical deterioration that is seen in patients with diastolic dysfunction (such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) in the presence of atrial fibrillation.</p><p>Diastolic dysfunction by echocardiography is one of the criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This topic summarizes available echocardiographic methods for assessment of LV diastolic function. Recommendations in this topic are generally in agreement with the American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for the evaluation of LV diastolic function by echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Diagnosis, management, and prognosis of HFpEF are discussed separately.

LV diastolic dysfunction can cause symptoms of dyspnea and reduced exercise tolerance in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Thus, assessment of diastolic function is an integral component of the echocardiographic examination in patients referred with a diagnosis of dyspnea or heart failure. Evaluation of diastolic function in asymptomatic patients with hypertension is also reasonable, as echocardiographic findings of diastolic dysfunction and its progression or lack thereof have been shown to predict clinical events of death and heart failure in observational and community studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction#H13537491\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3188776680\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnosis and evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic evaluation of diastolic dysfunction involves exclusion of confounding factors, identification of diastolic dysfunction and its severity, identification of the cause of diastolic dysfunction, identification of associated or concurrent conditions, and evaluation of clinical sequelae.

The tricuspid regurgitation (TR) peak velocity is commonly used to derive an estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

Mitral inflow indices are very useful in this patient subgroup for estimating LA pressure.

To determine whether diastolic dysfunction is present, we agree with the following approach described in the 2016 American Society of Echocardiography and European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A determination is made as to which of the following echocardiographic criteria are present (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indicators of diastolic function'</a> below): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">E/e&rsquo;</span> &gt;14; the <span class=\"nowrap\">E/e&rsquo;</span> is the ratio of early mitral inflow velocity (E) to mitral annular early diastolic velocity (e&rsquo;).

The presence of myocardial disease can be inferred from findings such as abnormally reduced early diastolic mitral annulus velocities and structural abnormalities such as LA enlargement. In the absence of mitral valve disease and atrial arrhythmias, LA enlargement reflects the consequences of chronically elevated LV pressure. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2956816950\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations and caveats</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A limitation of the above diagnostic approach is that technical limitations may prevent adequate assessment of some or all of the echocardiographic parameters for diastolic dysfunction. Even when the parameters can be assessed, some patients have indeterminate results since there is overlap between indices in healthy individuals and those in individuals with diastolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet by continuous wave (CW) Doppler and mean right atrial (RA) pressure (which may be inferred from the inferior vena cava size and its respiratory variation) are used to estimate PA systolic pressure.

On the other hand, a prolonged Ar duration indicates elevated late LV diastolic pressures irrespective of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. An SFF &lt;40 percent in patients with depressed LVEF is a reliable marker of increased LA pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similarly, a short deceleration time of pulmonary venous diastolic velocity has been reported in patients with increased LV filling pressures whether in sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>There are limitations to the clinical application of pulmonary venous flow, which include mitral valve disease (which limits use of SFF but not Ar duration), pericardial compression syndromes, heart block, and tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue Doppler imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) enables measurement of high amplitude, low frequency Doppler shifts caused by myocardial motion. Segmental and global function can be measured. For global function, the region of interest is placed at the septal and lateral borders of the mitral annulus. During systole, the annulus descends towards the apex, whereas it recoils back toward the base in early (e') and late (a') diastole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79797\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef79797 \">waveform 1</a>).

The color flow baseline is shifted to lower the Nyquist limit so that the central highest velocity jet is blue.

Normally, mean LA pressure is slightly higher than mean RA pressure and the septum bows to the right during most of the cardiac cycle.

Since RA pressure can be estimated using the inferior vena cava diameter and its change with respiration, as well as hepatic venous flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], if the septal curvature behaves as described above and RA pressure is normal, one can infer the presence of a normal LA pressure.
