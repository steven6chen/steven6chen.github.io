The bone can be forced to the front, back, or side of the joint. When this happens, the finger bones don't line up correctly.</p><p>A finger dislocation usually happens from a sudden injury. Sometimes, the injury causing the dislocation also causes a broken finger bone. The medical term for a broken finger bone is a &quot;finger fracture.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362252\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a finger dislocation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A finger dislocation causes pain and swelling around the joint. People can usually see or feel that their finger bone is out of position. Because the finger bone is out of position, people have trouble bending or straightening their finger.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362267\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you hurt your finger and you have symptoms of a finger dislocation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362282\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a finger dislocation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms, do an exam, and do an X-ray. An X-ray can show if your bone is out of position. It can also show if you have a finger fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362297\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a finger dislocation treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on how severe your finger dislocation is and if you also have a finger fracture.</p><p>People with a severe dislocation or who also have a finger fracture are usually treated by a specialist called a hand surgeon. He or she will likely need to do surgery to put the bone back in the correct position.</p><p>If your finger dislocation is not severe, the doctor can do a procedure to put your bone back in the correct position. Before he or she does this, you will get a shot to numb your finger or medicine to make you sleepy.</p><p>During the procedure, the doctor will gently push or pull your finger back into the correct position. Then he or she will put a splint on your finger or tape your finger to the finger next to it, called &quot;buddy taping&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82595\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82595 \">picture 1</a>). The doctor will do another X-ray to check that your bone is in the correct position. Most people need to wear a splint or use buddy taping for days to weeks, depending on which joint was dislocated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362312\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything else I should know about a finger dislocation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should know that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dislocated joint has a higher chance of dislocating again.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finger joint stiffness or soreness can last for many months after a finger dislocation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362327\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Finger fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-finger-injuries-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common finger injuries (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
