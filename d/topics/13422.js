The typical dental presentation of LCH is eruption of the primary molars at or soon after birth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70097\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70097 \">picture 1</a>). Additional oral manifestations include pain; ulceration; enlargement, inflammation, or recession of the gingiva; and mobility of teeth because of expansion of the alveolar bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

Leukemic gingival enlargement is typically painless, shiny, red, and edematous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114374\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114374 \">picture 2</a>); bleeding is common and can make it difficult to maintain oral hygiene.

The oral cavity is a reservoir for many microorganisms with the potential to cause systemic infection in the immunocompromised host. In addition, dental plaque causes gingivitis and gingival bleeding. Careful brushing with a soft toothbrush should be continued throughout therapy. Although it has been recommended that toothbrushing be suspended or replaced by cleaning with sponge-tipped brushes (&quot;toothettes&quot;) when platelet counts are low, these approaches are not adequate for plaque removal, and available evidence suggests problems are more likely to arise when oral hygiene is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>].

Wounds and abscesses heal poorly, and minimal pus is formed. The number of peripheral neutrophils is increased by their inability to leave the circulation and can be as high as <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span>. LAD is usually diagnosed on the basis of recurrent infection before oral manifestations occur.</p><p>Oral manifestations of LAD are seen in the early primary dentition and include severe gingival inflammation, rapid bone loss around nearly all teeth, and mobility and premature loss of teeth. The LAD-associated destruction of periodontal tissues is determined primarily by the unregulated localized increase of proinflammatory cytokines, not the lack of local antibacterial defenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The periodontitis associated with LAD has been called generalized prepubertal periodontitis in the dental literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis and treatment of LAD are discussed separately.

These conditions include infantile agranulocytosis (Kostmann syndrome), Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, myelokathexis, congenital dysgranulopoietic neutropenia, and the Chediak-Higashi syndrome. These are rare disorders, with an estimated frequency of two cases per million population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children with congenital neutropenia are susceptible to recurrent infection, often due to staphylococci and streptococci. Oral lesions, otitis media, respiratory infection, cellulitis, and skin abscesses are the most common. These infections heal slowly and may be fatal. Oral manifestations of congenital neutropenia include ulcers, severe gingivitis, alveolar bone loss, gingival recession, tooth mobility, and premature tooth exfoliation. An observational study suggests that mutations in the elastase gene are particularly significant for the development of periodontal disease in patients with congenital neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, other genetic diseases whose phenotype includes congenital neutropenia in the absence of elastase gene mutations, such as Cohen syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], may also have significant periodontal involvement characterized by severe gingivitis, alveolar bone loss, and premature tooth loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The treatment of congenital neutropenia usually involves the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and is discussed in detail separately.

AIN has been associated with a variety of underlying diseases, including viral infection, collagen vascular disease, primary abnormalities of B or T lymphocytes or natural killer cells, immune thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In most cases, however, AIN is not associated with other illness or underlying disease and is referred to as chronic benign neutropenia of infancy and childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

Spontaneous recovery occurs within 24 months in the majority of patients (95 percent in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Until they recover, children with this disorder are subject to recurrent, albeit mild, infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33</a>]. Although the neutropenia is severe (ANC less than <span class=\"nowrap\">500/microL),</span> the ANC can rise temporarily in response to acute infection. This temporary increase in neutrophil count can help in attenuating the severity of acute infection but has little effect on periodontal disease, which is a chronic infection. Severe gingivitis and periodontal disease may result without preventive measures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F105592\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105592 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyclic neutropenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyclic neutropenia is characterized by regular oscillations in the numbers of circulating neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and reticulocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. The cycles typically occur at 21-day intervals, but the intervals can range from 15 to 35 days.

The monocyte, eosinophil, platelet, and reticulocyte oscillations usually fluctuate from normal to high levels, and the periodicity of these cycles is typically the same as that for the neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. During periods of neutropenia, the bone marrow is usually hypoplastic, with myelocyte arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclic-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclic neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cyclic neutropenia can have onset in childhood or adulthood.

The severity of infections varies in relation to the severity of neutropenia. Gingival inflammation, edema, and recession can occur; alveolar bone support may be lost in the preschool-age child, resulting in premature tooth mobility and loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79500\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79500 \">picture 5</a>).

Neutropenia predisposes the child to hemorrhagic gingivitis and periodontal disease, but the progression of bone loss is because of the host response to pathogenic subgingival plaque. Thus, scrupulous oral hygiene, antimicrobial rinses, frequent professional tooth cleaning, and targeted antibiotic therapy can delay or halt periodontal bone loss.</p><p>Antibiotic therapy for neutropenic children with periodontal disease is determined by microbial cultures of the gingival sulcus. The organisms most commonly cultured in children with periodontal disease include <em>Prevotella intermedia</em>, <em>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</em>, <em>Eikenella corrodens</em>, and <em>Capnocytophaga sputigena</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].
