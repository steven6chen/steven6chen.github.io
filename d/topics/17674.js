The roles of systemic glucocorticoids and antifungal agents vary with the disease activity. Antifungal therapy may help to decrease exacerbations. Inhaled glucocorticoids may help control symptoms of asthma but do not have documented efficacy in preventing acute episodes of ABPA. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1410588640\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute ABPA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For acute ABPA manifest by radiographic opacities (usually upper or middle lobes) and an elevated total serum IgE (generally &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL),</span> systemic glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. In addition, the 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on the treatment of aspergillosis recommend that therapy of acute or recurrent ABPA should consist of a combination of glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Voriconazole</a> is a reasonable alternative to itraconazole because it is better tolerated in some patients and is well absorbed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1410588722\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic glucocorticoids are considered the mainstay of treatment of acute ABPA based on the results of case series; no clinical trials have been performed. As an example, a case series of 84 patients found no patients who failed to respond to a course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> with clearing of radiographic opacities, a decline of &gt;50 percent in total IgE, and a return of blood eosinophil counts to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a separate series, 126 patients with a new diagnosis of ABPA all responded to a course of oral glucocorticoids with development of remission (decline in IgE levels &gt;35 percent and clearance of chest radiographic lesions) by six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>One commonly used regimen is an initial dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily (or equivalent) for 14 days, followed by conversion to an every other day regimen of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> and further tapering and discontinuation at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Our approach differs from the approach advocated by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, which recommends itraconazole as part of initial therapy for acute ABPA, with the goal of enabling a reduction in the long-term glucocorticoid dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>]. When we use an antifungal agent, we administer it for 16 weeks. While some reports describe a longer duration of antifungal therapy (eg, three to six months or longer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>], the duration was 16 weeks in the two randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, the risks of adverse effects (eg, hepatotoxicity, nausea) and interactions with glucocorticoid metabolism have limited the widespread use of antifungal agents in ABPA. </p><p>Two randomized trials, a retrospective cohort study, and a small prospective study have demonstrated the utility of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> in addition to glucocorticoids for the therapy of ABPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/14,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17-20</a>]. The larger of the randomized trials compared itraconazole with placebo in 55 patients already receiving glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The addition of itraconazole for 16 weeks was associated with a significant increase in the likelihood of a clinical response (46 versus 19 percent). A response was defined as a reduction of at least 50 percent in the glucocorticoid dose, a decrease of at least 25 percent in the serum IgE concentration, and one of the following: an improvement of at least 25 percent in exercise tolerance or pulmonary function tests, or partial or complete resolution of pulmonary infiltrates. Adverse effects were similar in both groups. While total IgE decreases with therapy, specific IgE antibodies against <em>A. fumigatus</em> may not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Itraconazole</a> is thought to work by reducing the antigenic stimulus for bronchial inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The antifungal effects can be inferred by the ability of itraconazole to reduce specific <em>Aspergillus</em> IgG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Another possible contributor to itraconazole action in ABPA is by impairing metabolism of the glucocorticoid, thereby raising plasma levels. This effect is best described with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> but may not be important with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, which is the active form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The development of Cushing's syndrome has been recognized in ABPA patients treated with itraconazole and glucocorticoids, with most case reports involving inhaled glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Such patients are also at risk for adrenal insufficiency due to inhibition of cortisol synthesis, which becomes apparent with glucocorticoid dose reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Voriconazole</a> has a similar effect through inhibition of CYP3A4. </p><p>Many clinicians no longer use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> for invasive forms of pulmonary aspergillosis and use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> instead.

Whether voriconazole is superior to itraconazole in ABPA remains unknown, although voriconazole has distinct advantages to itraconazole, such as improved gastrointestinal tolerance and bioavailability.
