This definition is used by most guidelines, because most acute respiratory infections in children resolve within this interval, and evaluation at four weeks permits relatively early diagnosis of serious underlying illnesses. The guideline from the British Thoracic Society (BTS) is the only one that defines chronic cough as one that lasts more than eight weeks, but also recognizes that a relentlessly progressive cough often warrants evaluation prior to eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children#H651262326\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to chronic cough in children&quot;, section on 'Chronic cough'</a>)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2042171563\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific cough</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific cough refers to a chronic cough that is ultimately attributable to an underlying abnormality or disease, which is usually, but not always, of pulmonary origin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206 \">table 1</a>). In most cases of specific cough the initial evaluation will identify signs or symptoms suggesting the cause of the cough (known as &quot;specific cough pointers&quot;). These include symptoms such as wet cough or wheeze; timing, such as onset in neonatal period; associated conditions, such as failure to thrive or digital clubbing; abnormalities on chest radiograph or spirometry (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113208 \">table 2</a>); or classically recognizable cough sounds (eg, brassy or croup-like) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113265\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113265 \">table 3</a>). Many of these pointers are easily recognizable and are strong predictors of a specific cause. A specific cause of cough is very unlikely if no pointers are found on the initial evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One of the most important and discriminating pointers is presence of wet or productive cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A chronic wet cough signifies the presence of airway secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and in most cases airway infection, and should not be ignored in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>The main causes of specific cough are described in the remainder of this topic review. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3329694411\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonspecific cough</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conversely, &quot;nonspecific&quot; cough is defined as a chronic cough that does <strong>not</strong> have an identifiable cause, after a reasonable evaluation including history, physical examination, radiography, and spirometry. A chronic cough is likely to be nonspecific if it is dry and there are no abnormalities identified on initial evaluation (ie, no &quot;specific cough pointers&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206 \">table 1</a>)). This type of cough usually resolves gradually, but children should be reevaluated periodically for the emergence of signs or symptoms of specific cough. In some cases, nonspecific cough may represent a postviral syndrome. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473721683\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF CAUSES IN CHILDREN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three most common causes of chronic cough in children are asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), and nonspecific cough that resolves spontaneously, as described in multicenter studies and a systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Other causes are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206 \">table 1</a>). For some other diagnoses such as tuberculosis, the frequency varies by region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Of note, the causes of chronic cough in children are different from that of adults, so evaluation and management of children should be based on child-specific protocols and not those designed for adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. As an example, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and upper airway cough syndrome (formerly known as postnasal drip syndrome), are thought to be common causes of chronic cough in adults, but are probably not common causes in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>]. Adult cough guidelines have suggested empirical treatment of asthma, GERD, and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), because these are the most common causes in this population. By contrast, pediatric guidelines do not recommend empiric therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], although adolescents 15 years and older may be managed using guidelines for adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2609607663\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY CAUSES OF CHRONIC COUGH IN CHILDREN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2530204206\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic or recurrent aspiration is an uncommon but important cause of chronic cough. It may be due to a primary swallowing dysfunction or secondary to disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux or achalasia. Other risk factors for aspiration include neurological and developmental abnormalities, neuromuscular disease, and anatomic airway abnormalities (eg, laryngeal cleft or tracheoesophageal fistula). Some individuals with these disorders have a history of feeding difficulties, or coughing during feeding. However, the absence of cough during swallowing does not exclude aspiration, because aspiration can be &quot;silent,&quot; especially if it is chronic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-larynx\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the larynx&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-intrathoracic-airways-and-tracheoesophageal-fistula#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the intrathoracic airways and tracheoesophageal fistula&quot;, section on 'Tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3944935583\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some children, chronic cough can be the most prominent presenting symptom of asthma. However, isolated cough (cough in absence of other symptoms) is rarely asthma in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory symptoms</strong> &ndash; The cough associated with asthma is typically dry. A wet cough does not exclude asthma but should also raise the possibility of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) or aspirated foreign body (see <a href=\"#H2474017895\" class=\"local\">'Protracted bacterial bronchitis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4278960978\" class=\"local\">'Inhaled retained airway foreign body'</a> below). Typically in asthma there are associated symptoms of wheezing, exertional dyspnea, or atopy, although these features may not be recognized or initially reported by the parents. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Asthma in the absence of any of these symptoms, sometimes termed &quot;cough-dominant asthma,&quot; or &quot;cough-variant asthma&quot; may present as an apparently nonspecific cough. Most studies have suggested that this is an uncommon cause of cough in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/12,14,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,18,19</a>]. As an example, a randomized trial in children with nonspecific cough showed no benefit from treatment with beta agonists and steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Moreover, observational studies show that nonspecific cough has different risk factors and triggers than classic asthma and that nonspecific cough generally resolves spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although cough-dominant asthma is probably uncommon in children, it is still appropriate to consider the possibility of asthma in a child presenting with a chronic dry cough and no other apparent symptoms, primarily because the presence or absence of wheezing is not reliably recognized by the parents or reported on history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Therefore, evaluation for chronic cough in children should include careful questioning about clinical symptoms of wheezing or atopy, with spirometry and response to bronchodilators, and if warranted a trial of anti-asthma medications, as discussed below. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History</strong> &ndash; Clues to the presence of asthma include a history of eczema, rhinitis, or bronchiolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A family history of atopy or asthma is common. In addition a history of wheeze and paroxysmal cough (that responds to bronchodilators) may be reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], although parental reporting of wheeze is often inaccurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Episodes of asthma are often triggered by acute upper respiratory viral illnesses, exercise, cold, or known allergens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> &ndash; Initial evaluation of any child with chronic cough includes a chest radiograph and spirometry (if the child is able). The presence of bilateral hyperinflation on chest radiograph is often, although not always, indicative of asthma. In addition, changes within the right middle lobe are seen in children with asthma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113200\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113200 \">image 1</a>). Spirometry (generally performed in children aged &gt;6 years) that shows an obstructive pattern on the flow volume loop, which reverses with bronchodilators, indicates obstructive airway disease, most commonly asthma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the initial evaluation suggests a provisional diagnosis of asthma, the next step is a trial of asthma medications (empiric trial of bronchodilators [short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists] and low-dose inhaled corticosteroids) for two to four weeks, followed by reevaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113691\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113691 \">algorithm 1</a>). A clear response to this therapy strongly supports the diagnosis of asthma, but does not fully establish the diagnosis, because nonspecific cough unrelated to asthma frequently resolves spontaneously. Therefore, asthma medication should not be continued unless the diagnosis of asthma can be made with confidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Lack of response to asthma medications generally is sufficient to exclude asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initial evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initiating-therapy-and-monitoring-control\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initiating therapy and monitoring control&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In cases where it is particularly difficult to establish or exclude the possibility of asthma, an airway hyperresponsiveness challenge test in the pulmonary laboratory may be indicated if the child is old enough for testing (&gt;6 years). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H9440215\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initial evaluation and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Bronchoprovocation testing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1374505933\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic endobronchial suppurative disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic endobronchial suppurative disease represents a spectrum ranging from PBB, to chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD), to bronchiectasis. </p><p>The relationship among these disorders has not been fully established. A pathobiological model that has been proposed suggests PBB, CSLD, and bronchiectasis represent a spectrum of disease, with PBB at one end and irreversible bronchiectasis at the other, and that some children with PBB will progress to CSLD, then to bronchiectasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115194\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115194 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. All three diseases have similar pathobiology with airway neutrophilia, neutrophilic inflammation (elevated matrix metallopeptidase 9 [MMP-9], interleukin 1 beta [IL1-beta], Interleukin 8 [IL-8]) endobronchial infection with typical organisms and impaired mucociliary clearance and efferocytosis (removal of dying cells by macrophages) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. </p><p>Support for this model comes from a prospective study of 106 children with PBB, which found that a small percentage of children with PBB (12 percent) developed bronchiectasis within two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Risk factors for development of bronchiectasis were recurrent episodes of PBB and nontypeable <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> infection. A subsequent study found alveolar macrophages from children with PBB or bronchiectasis demonstrated reduced ability to phagocytose apoptotic airway epithelial cells as well as nontypeable <em>H. influenzae</em>, suggesting a possible etiology linking these two conditions and disease pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Further work is necessary to confirm whether PBB does indeed progress to bronchiectasis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2474017895\"><span class=\"h3\">Protracted bacterial bronchitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PBB is one of the most common causes of chronic wet cough, particularly in young children (&lt;5 years of age), accounting for about 40 percent of referrals to pediatric pulmonary specialist clinics in resource-rich countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This disorder is now incorporated into American, Australian, and European cough guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/3,14,15,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,15,30,31</a>]. Identification and treatment of PBB is important because it may be a precursor to CSLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

In these cases the term &quot;PBB-extended&quot; is used if the cough only resolves after an extended course (four weeks) of antibiotics; the term &quot;recurrent PBB&quot; is used when a child has more than three episodes per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Unlike asthma, PBB does not respond to bronchodilators and the cough is wet. However, asthma and PBB can coexist. If a child has a chronic wet cough and apparent asthma, but fails to respond to asthma medications, empiric treatment for PBB should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foreign body &ndash; The symptoms of PBB may also be indistinguishable from foreign body aspiration. Young children are at risk for unrecognized foreign body aspiration, and should be evaluated if there are suspicious features, such as a history of sudden onset of cough after choking, or while eating or playing. (See <a href=\"#H4278960978\" class=\"local\">'Inhaled retained airway foreign body'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchiectasis &ndash; Bronchiectasis may be associated with a previous or current respiratory infection or by other conditions that predispose to chronic lung infection, including immunodeficiency, anatomic abnormalities, cystic fibrosis, or primary ciliary dyskinesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87712\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87712 \">table 4</a>).

In a meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials including 190 children with chronic wet cough, treatment with antibiotics improved cough resolution compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR] for persistent cough 0.15, 95% CI 0.07-0.31). The studies included in the meta-analysis were heterogeneous in the definition of chronic cough, the specific antibiotic used, and duration of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In one of the trials included in this meta-analysis, treatment with a two-week course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> was significantly more likely to achieve resolution of cough compared with placebo (48 percent versus 16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. For children who continue to cough after two weeks of antibiotics, our clinical experience suggests that some will respond to a more prolonged course (up to four weeks). </p><p>For patients with a first clinical presentation and typical features of PBB, the antibiotics are usually selected empirically, targeted to the most likely causative organisms, or can be based upon the sensitivities of organisms if cultures are available from sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The most widely used antibiotic is oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a>, as it is active against beta-lactamase-producing strains of <em>H. influenzae</em>.

The cough is typically wet-sounding, but may be dry; and there may be associated wheezing or halitosis. The first step is a focused history, specifically asking about an episode of choking, even if weeks before, or sudden onset of the cough in a young child while eating or playing.

Findings suspicious for bronchial obstruction include asymmetry in aeration, and focal adventitious sounds, most commonly unilateral low-pitched monophonic wheeze. Only about 10 percent of objects aspirated by children are radio-opaque. Therefore, it is important to review the radiograph closely for findings suspicious for bronchial obstruction, particularly unilateral lung hyperinflation (lucency of the lung field distal to the obstruction) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113198\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113198 \">image 2</a>).

If suspected, the medication should be withdrawn and the cough usually resolves. </p><p>Other medications can cause lung disease that results in chronic cough, such as interstitial lung disease (ILD) with cytotoxic drugs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2801712746\"><span class=\"h2\">Tic cough (habit cough) and somatic cough disorder (psychogenic cough)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tic cough (previously referred to as habit cough) describes a cough with repetitive and habitual features similar to a vocal tic, especially suppressibility, distractibility, and suggestibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somatic cough disorder (previously known as psychogenic cough) is a diagnosis of exclusion after evaluation for other causes of cough and tic cough are excluded and the child fulfills criteria for somatic disorder as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p/><p>A tic or somatic cough has a distinctive nature; it may consist of short, single dry coughs (tics) or may be loud and repetitive <span class=\"nowrap\">(barking/honking</span> in nature). The cough is typically more prominent during office visits and absent at night; a history of an antecedent initial upper respiratory tract illness is common and may be a triggering event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. The physical examination is normal apart from the cough.

Children with somatic cough disorder may require referral to a psychologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychiatrist if unresponsive to suggestion therapy. </p><p>Cases of Tourette syndrome presenting with chronic cough have been reported; children with other vocal or motor tics should be further evaluated for this or another tic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].

In a systematic review, only two of the ten includes studies concluded that UACS was a common cause of cough in children; both of these studies were from Turkey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. By contrast, UACS is thought to be a common cause of chronic cough in adults (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;, section on 'Upper airway cough syndrome'</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic rhinosinusitis</strong> &ndash; Similarly, chronic noninfectious rhinitis is probably not a common cause of cough in children, although it is a recognized cause of UACS in adults. Nonetheless, if a child has chronic cough and symptoms of a chronic noninfectious rhinitis (eg, because of chronic clear nasal drainage and boggy or edematous nasal mucosa), a trial of intranasal glucocorticoids is appropriate.

Typical symptoms of chronic sinusitis are a thick and colored chronic nasal discharge. It is common practice to treat patients empirically with antibiotics, and in some cases both the discharge and cough improve with treatment. However, this response does not prove an association between sinusitis and cough. This is because patients with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) may present with identical symptoms, and would respond to antibiotics. Moreover, many other cases of chronic cough will improve or resolve over time regardless of the intervention.

Specific cough refers to a chronic cough that is ultimately attributable to an underlying abnormality or disease, which is usually, but not always, of pulmonary origin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206 \">table 1</a>). Conversely, &quot;nonspecific cough&quot; is defined as a chronic cough that does not have an identifiable cause after a reasonable evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H2981565065\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of a child with chronic cough should include a detailed history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and spirometry (when possible) using algorithmic approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113691\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113691 \">algorithm 1</a>). If the initial evaluation provides clues suggesting a specific cause of cough, further evaluation is focused on that diagnostic possibility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to chronic cough in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a common cause of chronic cough in young children (&lt;5 years of age) in Australia, Europe, and similar populations. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A provisional diagnosis of PBB can be made in a child presenting with chronic wet cough, no other symptoms, and no evidence of an alternative diagnosis (eg, retained airway foreign body or pneumonia) after a standard clinical evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113208 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2474017895\" class=\"local\">'Protracted bacterial bronchitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a provisional diagnosis of PBB, we suggest antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Small randomized trials have shown that, compared with placebo, a one- to two-week course of antibiotics improves cough resolution in children with chronic wet cough. We typically treat with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> for two weeks. Alternatives include oral second- or third-generation cephalosporins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, or a macrolide. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Azithromycin</a> should not be used in this setting due to lack of demonstrated efficacy and concerns of inducing antibiotic resistant organisms. (See <a href=\"#H4011614076\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children who continue to cough after two weeks of antibiotics, we suggest prolonging the course of antibiotics (up to four weeks) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is based largely on our clinical experience; clinical trial data are lacking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If a wet cough fails to improve after a four-week course of antibiotics, or if PBB recurs frequently, the patient should be further evaluated for other causes, including a retained foreign body, congenital abnormalities, and bronchiectasis and its causative disorders such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and immune deficiencies. (See <a href=\"#H1484664501\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent PBB'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3848036848\" class=\"local\">'Bronchiectasis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma is a common cause of chronic cough in children. It usually is associated with symptoms of wheezing, although some children may have cough as their primary or only symptom of asthma. Therefore, evaluation for chronic cough in children should include careful questioning about clinical symptoms of exertional dyspnea, recurrent wheezing or atopy, with spirometry and evaluation of response to bronchodilators. If the initial evaluation suggests a provisional diagnosis of asthma, the next step is a trial of asthma medications (empiric trial of bronchodilators [short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low-dose inhaled corticosteroids) for two to four weeks, followed by reevaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113691\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113691 \">algorithm 1</a>). Asthma medication should not be continued unless the diagnosis of asthma can be made with confidence. (See <a href=\"#H3944935583\" class=\"local\">'Asthma'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young children with a chronic cough that have a history of sudden onset after a choking episode or began after eating or playing should always be evaluated to exclude the possibility of an inhaled foreign body. These children should be evaluated with a chest radiograph as a first step, but should also be referred to a specialist for evaluation and urgent bronchoscopy, regardless of radiographic findings.
