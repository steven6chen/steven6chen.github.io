Despite the common clinical use of the term ischemic cardiomyopathy, there is no consensus of the term ischemic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Additionally, ventricular dysfunction caused by coronary disease is not a cardiomyopathy as defined by the 2006 American Heart Association and 2008 European Society of Cardiology statements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are two main pathogenetic mechanisms, which are importantly distinguished by the possibility of corrective therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irreversible loss of myocardium due to prior myocardial infarction with ventricular remodeling. Recovery of myocardial function in such patients cannot be achieved by coronary revascularization since the infarcted tissue is not viable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least partially reversible loss of contractility due to reduced function of ischemic but still viable myocardium, which can be detected on imaging studies. Hibernating myocardium is typically used interchangeably with viable myocardium. However, by strict definition, the term hibernating myocardium refers to contractile dysfunction in viable myocardium that improves after revascularization or perhaps medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Stunned myocardium refers to transient postischemic dysfunction and can coexist with hibernating myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Repetitive bouts of stunned myocardium can also result in hibernating myocardium.

A more extensive discussion of the pharmacologic therapies for heart failure is presented separately.

These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, most antiarrhythmic drugs, and the non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>).

In the CHRISTMAS trial of 387 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> or placebo, there was a significant linear relationship between the number of cardiac segments with viable myocardium at baseline and the improvement in LVEF seen at six months with carvedilol therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Beta blockade may improve the function of viable but hibernating myocardium by reducing myocardial oxygen consumption and increasing diastolic perfusion.

Most patients who satisfy these criteria are also candidates for an ICD and receive a combined device. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p>Patients being considered for a primary prevention ICD should have had their pharmacologic therapy optimized and should be at least 40 days post-myocardial infarction and more than three months post-revascularization. In addition, there should be a reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for at least one year for patients considered for ICD therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CORONARY ARTERY REVASCULARIZATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3599437131\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 35 percent or less) and coronary artery disease that is amenable to surgical revascularization, we suggest the combination of surgical revascularization and medical therapy rather than medical therapy alone. This suggestion is based primarily on a 7 percent absolute reduction in overall mortality over a period of 10 years following coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]. However, based on the significant morbidity associated with CABG surgery, patients may also reasonably choose medical therapy alone as the initial treatment option. Following initiation of medical therapy, patients should be reevaluated on an ongoing basis for any changes in clinical status or symptoms. While angina was not required for patients to derive a clinical benefit from surgical revascularization, the presence of angina symptoms despite medical therapy, and the potential relief of such symptoms by revascularization, is often a factor in choosing a treatment strategy.</p><p>Other clinical features were associated with improved outcomes in STICH and can be considered to help the clinician tailor the decision making for any given individual patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Such features include greater functional capacity (six-minute walk &gt;300 meters), greater burden of CAD (eg, three-vessel disease), coexistent moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, lower ejection fraction (eg, EF &lt;27 percent), and greater remodeling (eg, left ventricular end systolic volume index [LVESVI] &gt;79 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/m2)</span>.</p><p>In order to result in enough ischemia or infarction (or a combination of the two) to cause ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease should typically be multivessel. Multiple society guidelines from both North America and Europe discuss surgical revascularization in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular function and a variety of coronary anatomies (significant left main disease, left main equivalent disease [&ge;70 percent stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and proximal left circumflex arteries], proximal LAD stenosis with two or three vessel disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8,9,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,14,15</a>]. </p><p>Additionally, we do not recommend routine viability assessment prior to consideration for surgical revascularization, but consider this on a case by case basis in patients in whom the risk-to-benefit profile is not as clear (eg, patients with significantly elevated surgical risk). (See <a href=\"#H3031431019\" class=\"local\">'Impact of myocardial viability on treatment decisions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2097278390\"><span class=\"h2\">Randomized trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term (10-year) follow-up from the largest randomized trial of surgical revascularization compared with medical therapy alone showed a significant overall mortality benefit for patients who underwent surgical revascularization. This is consistent with the results of early observational studies (and a subsequent meta-analysis of these studies). (See <a href=\"#H3031431019\" class=\"local\">'Impact of myocardial viability on treatment decisions'</a> below.)</p><p>In 2011, the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) trial was the first randomized trial to compare surgical revascularization with medical therapy in patients with LVEF of 35 percent or less and coronary artery disease amenable to CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The STICH trial randomly assigned 1212 patients to medical therapy plus CABG surgery or medical therapy alone. All patients underwent coronary angiography to define the extent of coronary disease; patients with critical left main coronary disease or unstable coronary syndromes were excluded from the trial. The primary outcome of the study was all-cause mortality, with two additional prespecified secondary outcomes (cardiovascular mortality, combination of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for cardiac causes). At a median follow-up of 56 months, medical therapy plus CABG surgery resulted in a non-significant trend toward improvement in the primary outcome of all-cause mortality (36 versus 41 percent with medical therapy alone) as well as significantly lower cardiovascular mortality and significantly improved quality of life (at 4, 12, 24, and 36 months as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the STICH trial, 9 percent of the patients assigned to the medical therapy plus CABG group did not receive CABG, and 17 percent of the patients assigned to the medical therapy alone group underwent CABG during the study period. Crossover between the treatment groups may have led to a diminished treatment benefit, thereby preventing the primary outcome from reaching statistical significance. </p><p>Additionally, the STICH trial was designed to maximize both medical and surgical outcomes using strict criteria for surgical expertise (eg, documented surgical expertise by volume and outcome criteria) and regular review of both surgical center conduct and intensity of medical therapy. Clinical equipoise had to be present, and both the surgeon and cardiologist had to believe revascularization was technically feasible. Both of these issues may limit the generalizability of the trial to routine clinical practice.</p><p>In 2016, the STICH Extension Study (STICHES) was published, extending the follow-up to a median of 9.8 years on the STICH population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. After 9.8 years, the primary outcome (all-cause mortality) was significantly lower in the CABG group compared with patients in the medical therapy group (59 versus 66 percent [359 versus 398 patients]; HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.73-0.97). The CABG group also experienced significant reductions in the prespecified secondary outcomes of cardiovascular mortality (40.5 versus 49.3 percent; HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66-0.93) and the combination of all-cause mortality with cardiovascular hospitalization (76.6 versus 87 percent; HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.64-0.82). Based upon these absolute reductions in long-term (ie, 10-year) total and cardiovascular mortality, we suggest the combination of CABG surgery and medical therapy rather than medical therapy alone for patients with coronary artery disease (amenable to surgical revascularization) and LVEF of 35 percent or less. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3031431019\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of myocardial viability on treatment decisions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of the presence or absence of viable myocardium on the outcomes following revascularization has long been debated. We do not recommend routine viability assessment prior to consideration for surgical revascularization on the basis of the STICH trial viability substudy. However, many situations will require greater precision in defining large infarcts when surgical morbidity may be excessive (eg, renal failure) or outcomes may not be optimal (eg, evidence of LV remodeling, inability to achieve complete revascularization). In these situations, viability assessment with more contemporary techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) prior to revascularization may help to further refine the potential risks and benefits.</p><p>An estimated 20 to more than 50 percent of patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction have a significant amount of viable myocardium and the potential for clinically important improvement in LV function after revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Most but not all observational studies have found that revascularization of viable hibernating myocardium in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy improves both survival and left ventricular function compared with medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6,16,18,20-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16,18,20-30</a>]. However, as is the case with nonrandomized trials, observational studies have important limitations, including selection bias in patients who undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, a lesser likelihood of publication of negative studies, and uncertain applicability to current practice due to lack of use of current medical therapies (eg, statins).</p><p>The potential survival benefit from revascularization was best demonstrated in a 2002 meta-analysis of 24 nonrandomized viability studies involving 3088 patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction who had a mean LVEF of 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients with myocardial viability had a significant 80 percent reduction in annual mortality with revascularization (3.2 versus 16 percent with medical therapy), while there was no difference in annual mortality with revascularization in patients without myocardial viability (annual mortality 7.7 versus 6.2 percent with medical therapy). In observational studies, the likelihood of improved survival after revascularization in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy appeared to be related to the amount of viable myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,31</a>]. </p><p>Additionally, the presence of viable myocardium has been associated with greater improvement in LVEF following revascularization, as was illustrated in a review of 29 observational studies of 758 patients in which LVEF increased 8 percent after revascularization when myocardial viability was present (37 versus 45 percent) but did not change in the absence of viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Improvement in contractility and myocardial thickness among thinned myocardial segments has also been shown following revascularization, although this improvement was limited to segments in which myocardial scar burden (as detected by late gadolinium enhancement during cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR] imaging) was less than 50 percent of the myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The degree of improvement is significantly correlated with the number of segments that recover function after revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>However, in a substudy of the randomized STICH trial, 601 of the 1212 patients were evaluated for myocardial viability (albeit not in a randomized fashion), and outcomes were analyzed according to those assigned to receive medical therapy plus CABG surgery or medical therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Following adjustment for differences in baseline variables, there was no significant improvement in mortality with medical therapy plus CABG surgery compared with medical therapy alone. Myocardial viability was associated with improved mortality but did not predict a benefit (compared to those without myocardial viability) from revascularization, which raises the question of whether viability assessment is needed prior to surgical revascularization. Myocardial viability in this study was assessed using stress echocardiography and SPECT radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging; more contemporary techniques such as CMR and positron emission tomography (PET) were not studied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of LV size and remodeling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left ventricular size may be a determinant of outcome after surgical revascularization in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. When the left ventricular end diastolic dimension is greater than 7 cm (4 cm per m<sup>2</sup>), operative mortality is high and surgery should be carefully reconsidered. The impact of left ventricular enlargement on the improvement in left ventricular function after surgery was illustrated in a review of 61 patients with ischemic heart disease and a mean LVEF of 28 percent, all of whom had evidence of myocardial viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, one-third of patients had no increase in LVEF despite the presence of substantial viability. The patients with a significant improvement in LVEF (&ge;5 percent) had a significantly smaller left ventricular end-systolic volume by echocardiography than those without improvement (121 versus 153 mL). These observational data are in contrast to the findings from the STICH trial, which suggested that greater benefit with respect to mortality was seen with greater baseline remodeling (eg, larger end-systolic volume index [ESVI]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">PCI versus surgical revascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are limited on the relative efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, and the only randomized trial data involved surgical revascularization. An ongoing trial, estimated to be completed in 2019, is comparing the effects of PCI with medical therapy alone on all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Additionally, there are no prospective studies that directly compare PCI and surgical revascularization. </p><p>The best available observational data comparing PCI with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) come from 4616 patients with LVEF of 35 percent or lower who were enrolled in the New York State registries on PCI and CABG (including 1351 who underwent PCI with drug eluting stents and 3265 who underwent surgical revascularization), from which 2126 patients were chosen for evaluation based on similar results from propensity score matching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. At a median follow-up of 2.9 years, there was no significant difference in death between contemporary PCI and CABG (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.81-1.28). PCI was associated with a greater risk of myocardial infarction (HR 2.16; 95% CI 1.42-3.28) and need for repeat revascularization (HR 2.54; 95% CI 1.88-3.44), but a significantly lower risk of stroke compared with CABG (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.33-0.97).</p><p>In a separate post hoc analysis from the AWESOME trial, in which 454 patients who had medically refractory unstable or provocable ischemia after stabilization with medical therapy were randomized to PCI or surgical revascularization, 94 patients had an LVEF &lt;35 percent (mean 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Among these patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, as well as patients with an LVEF &lt;35 percent in the nonrandomized AWESOME registry, there was no difference in mortality with CABG or PCI. However, this was a trial of patients with angina and acute coronary syndromes, not heart failure.

Issues related to the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of ischemic MR are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation#H111256161\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Secondary MR'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of chronic secondary mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">LEFT VENTRICULAR RECONSTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemic cardiomyopathy is often associated with both dyskinetic and akinetic segments of the left ventricle due to both infarction and ischemia. Such changes led to an increase in the sphericity of the ventricle, increasing wall stress. Surgical remodeling of the ventricle involves resection of these segments (usually in the anterior wall) to reestablish the mechanically efficient elliptical structure of the left ventricle; this procedure can be combined with surgical revascularization. Despite these theoretical benefits, a randomized trial of 1000 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and an anterior akinetic or dyskinetic region of myocardium amenable to ventricular reconstruction found that the addition of left ventricular reconstruction to surgical revascularization did not improve outcomes compared to surgical revascularization alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Because of this, we do not routinely proceed with left ventricular reconstruction at the time of surgical revascularization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-heart-failure#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of heart failure&quot;, section on 'Left ventricular reconstruction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H665604865\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Ischemic cardiomyopathy can result from irreversible loss of myocardium due to prior myocardial infarction or from reversible loss of contractility due to chronically ischemic but still viable myocardium. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial approach to therapy for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy should focus on the optimal guideline-directed medical therapy and lifestyle intervention in all patients, with device-based therapies (ie, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy) and coronary revascularization considered in appropriate selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H2685932738\" class=\"local\">'Overview of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medical therapies used in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy are similar to those for patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. These include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and diuretics with dietary salt restriction in patients with fluid overload. Other therapies to consider in selected patients include the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> and a nitrate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivabradine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivabradine</a>, aldosterone antagonists, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sacubitril-and-valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sacubitril-valsartan</a>. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of lifestyle interventions also improve outcomes, including smoking cessation, maintenance of a healthy diet, weight reduction, and regular physical activity. (See <a href=\"#H92683144\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to pharmacologic therapies and lifestyle interventions, two types of devices are recommended in selected patients with heart failure: an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy with biventricular pacing. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Device therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 35 percent or less) and coronary artery disease that is amenable to surgical revascularization, we suggest the combination of surgical revascularization and medical therapy rather than medical therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This suggestion is based primarily on the long-term&nbsp;absolute reduction in mortality over the 10 years following CABG balanced against the early mortality risk of CABG. Based on the small but non-trivial early mortality risk associated with CABG surgery as well as other post-CABG morbidities, patients may also reasonably choose medical therapy as the initial treatment option. (See <a href=\"#H3599437131\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Revascularization remains an important treatment option for patients with ongoing anginal symptoms despite optimal medical therapy. For such patients, the relative efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with CABG for revascularization is unknown. Nonrandomized registry suggests that there was no difference in mortality between CABG and PCI. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'PCI versus surgical revascularization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Maron BJ, Towbin JA, Thiene G, et al.
