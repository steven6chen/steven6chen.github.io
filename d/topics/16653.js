Ureteral injuries identified in the postoperative period require a delayed operative repair. </p><p>Ureteral injuries can occur during open or laparoscopic intra-abdominal, vaginal, and endourological procedures. In a retrospective review of 165 patients with iatrogenic ureteral injuries over a 20-year span, endourologic procedures were responsible for most iatrogenic injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Urologic, gynecologic, and general surgical procedures were responsible for 42, 34, and 24 percent of injuries, respectively. </p><p>Injury to the ureter is the most common complication of pelvic surgery, ranging from less than 1 to 10 percent of procedures, depending on the complexity of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Prevention is ideal, and early recognition is the next best approach. Nevertheless, despite preventive measures (eg, radiographic imaging, ureteral stents) to minimize injury to the ureter in high-risk clinical settings (eg, previous pelvic surgery, one functioning kidney), injuries still occur, and a high level of intraoperative and postoperative vigilance is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The surgical management of iatrogenic ureteral injuries, whether identified early or late, is discussed here. The incidence, prevention, recognition, and evaluation of ureteral injuries following gynecologic and colorectal procedures are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Identification and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Epidemiology and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery#H12351106\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of intra-abdominal, pelvic, and genitourinary complications of colorectal surgery&quot;, section on 'Ureteral injury'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455805586\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most ureteral injuries are not identified intraoperatively but rather in the postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/3-5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,8</a>]. The general principles of recognizing an iatrogenic injury to the ureter are the same, regardless of the indications of the operative procedure. </p><p>An intraoperative consultation with a skilled urologist is necessary if the operating surgeon is inexperienced with a primary or advanced repair and stenting of a ureter. Prior to initiating the repair, the surgeon should review the preoperative imaging of the urinary tract (if performed) and extensiveness of the injury, including contralateral ureteral and bladder injury. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Indigo carmine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> is administered intravenously to aid in evaluating the integrity of the ureters. Alternatively, the dyes are instilled via a urethral catheter to help identify or confirm bladder injuries. The surgeon should determine if both kidneys are functioning. </p><p>If a patient has received antibiotic prophylaxis for the procedure, additional antibiotics are not administered for a ureteral injury. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for genitourinary, gynecologic and obstetrical surgery, and colon and rectal surgery is provided in the accompanying tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65369 \">table 1</a>). If a patient has not received prophylactic antibiotics, we administer antimicrobial agents (cephalosporins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, or fluoroquinolones) to cover enteric gram-negative bacilli that comprise most urinary tract pathogens.</p><p>Intraoperative and postoperative recognition and evaluation of ureteral injury are reviewed separately.

If the contusion is substantial, or if the blood supply is in question, the injured section of the ureter should be debrided to healthy tissue and an ureteroureterostomy performed. (See <a href=\"#H13920595\" class=\"local\">'Ureteroureterostomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1104019598\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF A LIGATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the ureter is inadvertently ligated, the suture should be removed and the ureter observed for viability. If compromise is observed, the injured ureter should be resected and an ureteroureterostomy performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

If the injury is recognized early, placement of a ureteral stent is attempted. If not feasible, a primary repair is attempted. Advances in endourologic technique and equipment may provide a minimally invasive approach to postoperative iatrogenic injuries. Endoscopic realignment utilizing one or more stents for complete ureteral transections has been used for immediate postoperative and delayed injury cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p>Primary repair (eg, ureteroureterostomy, ureteroneocystostomy) is the preferred approach for ureteral injuries recognized intraoperatively. A primary ureteroureterostomy is the optimal technique when the anastomosis can be performed without tension. The ureteral anastomosis following any type of primary repair is typically stented.</p><p>When more extensive damage is present that would preclude a primary anastomosis, an advanced surgical repair, such as a flap procedure, autotransplantation, or nephrectomy, is performed. When the initial approach was laparoscopic or for a delayed repair, a laparoscopic repair can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H455805614\" class=\"local\">'Role of minimally invasive repair'</a> below.)</p><p>The approach for patients with a delayed recognition of a ureteral injury is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some advocate for stent placement as the first line of therapy while others perform a primary repair as soon as possible. If the injury is recognized late and there are complications (eg, abscess, urinary infection, urinary fistula) that would interfere with ureteral healing, proximal urinary drainage by a percutaneous nephrostomy is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In these settings, a ureteroneocystostomy (ureteral reimplant) is usually preferred. There are several techniques described, such as the Leadbetter-Politano and extravesical approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leadbetter-Politano is an intravesical technique that involves creating a submucosal tunnel to create a &quot;flap valve&quot; and prevent reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Whether to stent the reimplanted ureter is determined by the surgeon. We use a stent if the ureter has been extensively mobilized prior to the reimplantation.

The optimal procedure for repair of an upper ureteral injury is a ureteroureterostomy, if sufficient length can be mobilized for a primary repair without tension. This can be facilitated by mobilization of the kidney with fixation to the psoas tendon (nephropexy) to provide for a tension-free anastomosis. Mobilization of the left kidney can provide up to 4 cm of length, but mobilization of the right kidney does not add much length to the right ureter as the right kidney is limited by a short right renal vein. The general principles are described in a preceding section. (See <a href=\"#H13920595\" class=\"local\">'Ureteroureterostomy'</a> above.)</p><p>When sufficient length cannot be mobilized for ureteroureterostomy, the options include an autotransplantation, ileal or appendiceal interposition graft, or a nephrectomy.

Nephrectomy eliminates the risk of ureteral leak from an anastomosis and, as an independent procedure, is associated with low mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455805614\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic ureteral repair is technically feasible and an option to an open repair for a delayed diagnosis of a ureteral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. When performed laparoscopically, ureteroureterostomy and ureteroneocystostomy anastomoses are technically easier to perform than an implantation; a Boari flap is challenging but feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/30,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,45</a>]. Robotic-assisted laparoscopy for ureteral reimplantation and repair is another minimally invasive approach that can be performed efficaciously when performed by skilled surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>Most cases and series involve ureteroneocystostomy with psoas hitch ureteral implantation either by an extravesical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] or intravesical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]<sup> </sup>or extravesical cystoscopy-assisted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]<sup> </sup>techniques. The latter two approaches create a submucosal tunnel and allow for nonreflux reimplantation of the ureter. There is limited experience with robotic-assisted approaches for ureteroneocystostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13920074\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management specific for the ureteral injury includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the suprapubic tube, if used, on postoperative day 2 or 3, providing the urine is clear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain a cystogram at day 7.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the indwelling urethral catheter when no leak is observed on the cystogram, typically seven days postoperatively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain computed tomography (CT) urogram two to three weeks after surgery to confirm no anastomotic leak. Internal stents are removed only after no leak is demonstrated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not use prophylactic antibiotics, even with prolonged use of an indwelling catheter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455805635\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with immediate recognition of the injury have few complications. Urinary leakage occurs in approximately 10 to 24 percent of ureteroureterostomy repairs for injury, including early and delayed recognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Most urinary leaks that occur in the early postoperative period can be managed successfully with continued drainage. If an unstented ureter is leaking, either a stent or nephrostomy tube can usually successfully manage the problem. </p><p>Less common acute complications include abscess and fistula formation. Abscesses should be drained, either percutaneously or by an open procedure, depending upon technical expertise and amenability of abscess to percutaneous drainage. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13920136\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term outcome data are limited to small series and case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/25,36,37,43,44,53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,36,37,43,44,53-55</a>]. Long-term results are excellent if the diagnosis and repair is performed at the time of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/9,10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,14</a>]. A delay in diagnosis worsens the prognosis because of infection, hydronephrosis, abscess, and fistula formation.</p><p>Ureteral strictures, which occur in 10 percent of ureteroureterostomy repairs, typically are a late complication of ureteral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In most cases they can be managed endoscopically with balloon dilation. If endoscopic management fails, then open repair may be necessary. </p><p>Ureteral reflux is expected in patients in whom an antirefluxing type of reimplantation is not performed. In the adult, reflux generally does not lead to long-term problems with infection or pyelonephritis, and renal deterioration is uncommon. Obstruction at the site of reimplantation is uncommon (&lt;5 percent) and may necessitate dilation or open repair with redo reimplantation.</p><p>Fistula formation is very uncommon (&lt;1 percent of repairs), especially if the repair is stented and drained. Ureteric fistulas are typically caused by distal obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455805642\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative iatrogenic ureteral injuries, if recognized during the operation, should be repaired at that setting. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For lower, middle, and upper ureteral injuries, we perform a ureteroureterostomy as the optimal approach if it can be performed without anastomotic tension. (See <a href=\"#H13920595\" class=\"local\">'Ureteroureterostomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For lower ureteral injuries that cannot be reapproximated with a tension-free anastomosis, and when the injury is within the distal 2 cm from the ureterovesical junction, we perform a ureteroneocystostomy. (See <a href=\"#H13920602\" class=\"local\">'Ureteroneocystostomy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For lower ureteral injuries that cannot be repaired by a ureteroureterostomy or ureteroneocystostomy, we perform a psoas hitch implantation repair. (See <a href=\"#H13920609\" class=\"local\">'Psoas hitch ureteral reimplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For middle ureteral injuries, a ureteroureterostomy without tension is the optimal repair. A transureteroureterostomy or a Boari flap is performed for extensively injured middle ureters (see <a href=\"#H455805600\" class=\"local\">'Middle ureter'</a> above). A transureteroureterostomy cannot be performed in a patient with a history of renal stones or a nonfunctioning contralateral kidney.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For upper ureteral injuries, the optimal repair is a ureteroureterostomy. However, in situations where there is insufficient proximal ureter for a tension-free anastomosis, options include an autotransplant, bowel interposition graft, or a nephrectomy. (See <a href=\"#H455805607\" class=\"local\">'Upper ureter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H734317455\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Kevin R Loughlin, MD, MBA, and Colleen Feltmate, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-repair-of-an-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Redan JA, McCarus SD.
