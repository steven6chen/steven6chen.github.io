They are primarily categorized based upon the length of the fatty acid chain. FAODs lead to deficient energy production and produce widely variable clinical presentations ranging from mild hypotonia in adults to sudden death in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the major types of FAODs and disease-specific management. A general overview of the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of FAODs is presented separately.

LCFAODs are typically associated with a more severe phenotype due to a greater energy deficit, with symptoms including cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, skeletal myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, transaminitis, liver failure, and retinal degeneration. However, milder disease with adolescent or adult onset can occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2762555973\"><span class=\"h2\">Carnitine cycle defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carnitine is essential for long-chain fatty acid transport through the cell membrane and mitochondrial outer and inner membranes into the mitochondrial matrix where fatty acid oxidation occurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59178\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59178 \">figure 1</a>). The carnitine transport cycle includes a sodium-dependent carnitine transporter that moves carnitine across the cell membrane and into the cytosol, a transferase (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 [CPT1]) that covalently links carnitine to the long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, an acylcarnitine translocase (carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase [CACT]) that transports carnitine and carnitine-fatty acid complexes across the mitochondrial membrane, and then a second transferase (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 [CPT2]) that removes the carnitine from the long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. Deficiency in any of these components disrupts the carnitine cycle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3724086895\"><span class=\"h3\">Carnitine transporter deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carnitine transporter deficiency (CTD; also called primary systemic carnitine deficiency or carnitine uptake defect) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the solute carrier family 22 member 5 (<em>SLC22A5</em>) gene that encodes a high-affinity sodium-ion dependent organic cation transporter protein (OCTN2) expressed in heart muscle, kidney, lymphoblasts, and fibroblasts. CTD is characterized by hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, liver dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, and skeletal hypotonia. Presentation during the neonatal period is uncommon. Cardiomyopathy may be the presenting sign in children or young adults.</p><p>Profoundly low plasma total and free carnitine levels (typically less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> in plasma) are found. False-positive newborn screening (NBS) for low free carnitine levels may be due to neonatal nutritional deficiency or secondary to low maternal plasma carnitine levels from either dietary restriction (eg, vegan diet) or previously unrecognized maternal CTD. Measurement of maternal total and free carnitine levels are necessary when performing follow-up testing of an abnormal NBS. Maternal CTD may be clinically significant and benefit from carnitine supplementation, although some mothers may have been asymptomatic or have mild symptoms that were not clinically recognized. Diagnostic confirmation through DNA sequencing of the <em>SLC22A5 </em>gene is typically adequate, although analysis of fibroblast carnitine uptake is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Treatment of CTD involves supplementation with carnitine, usually at doses of at least 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day,</span> adjusted as necessary to obtain normal total and free plasma carnitine levels. Fasting avoidance and frequent feeding are generally recommended. Outcomes are positive with improvements in cardiomyopathy, hypoglycemia, and rhabdomyolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2970159843\"><span class=\"h3\">Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CPT1 enzyme has three different isoforms encoded by different genes. Deficiency of only <em>CTP1A, </em>expressed in the liver and kidney, has been described. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A deficiency (CPT1AD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that typically presents in early childhood with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction, which may quickly progress to liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy. Cardiomyopathy or skeletal myopathy is not seen, although renal tubular acidosis has been reported during episodes of acute decompensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Symptoms are often triggered by fasting or by a concurrent infection, fever, or gastrointestinal illness, and onset of symptoms is typically rapid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>A milder phenotype associated with a common <em>CPT1A</em> variant, c.1436C&gt;T (p.P479L), occurs in the Arctic populations of the Inuit, Alaskan Native, Canadian First Nations, and Hutterites, although it is still associated with higher infant mortality and impaired fasting intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].

Confirmatory testing is through the demonstration of mutations in the <em>CPT1A</em> gene or enzyme activity in skin fibroblasts.</p><p>Treatment includes fasting avoidance, a low-fat diet with medium chain triglyceride (MCT, medium chain fatty acids) supplementation, and supportive care during illness.

VLCAD is highly expressed in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle.

Plasma acylcarnitine profile shows elevations of C14:1-, C14-, C16:1-, and C16-acylcarnitines levels, with low secondary free carnitine levels in some infants. During an acute metabolic decompensation, urine organic acid analysis may demonstrate longer-chain dicarboxylic aciduria. Most patients with VLCADD in the United States and other developed countries are detected through NBS by acylcarnitine profiling. Confirmation by sequencing and <span class=\"nowrap\">deletion/duplication</span> analysis of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, very long chain gene (<em>ACADVL</em>) is recommended, but the identification of mild or benign DNA variants represents a significant challenge. Individuals with a single mutation are heterozygous, unaffected carriers, although the presence of a second, undetected mutation is still possible. Patients with two compound heterozygous mutations may have a reduced risk of developing symptoms, although the degree of severity of these symptoms may still be as significant as those with known severe mutations. Leukocyte enzyme assay or fatty acid oxidation probe analysis may be helpful to determine treatment when a single heterozygous or novel heterozygous variants are found <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there are persistent acylcarnitine elevations inconsistent with the genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Treatment follows the general principles for management of LCFAODs including prolonged fasting avoidance, dietary fat restriction, and MCT supplementation. In the past, supplementation with L-carnitine was a proposed therapy for FAODs, but this therapy has become more controversial. Symptomatic infants should discontinue breastfeeding (due to the high fat content in breast milk) and start MCT-containing formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

The term &quot;isolated long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency&quot; (LCHADD) indicates that only the dehydrogenase activity of the protein is deficient, caused by certain mutations in the <em>HADHA </em>gene. Deficiency of all three enzymes is termed trifunctional protein deficiency (TFPD) and results from mutations in either the <em>HADHA</em> or <em>HADHB </em>genes. Both LCHADD and TFPD are autosomal recessive disorders. The prevalence of LCHADD ranges from 1 in 110,000 to 150,000; TFPD is much rarer.</p><p>The most severe forms of LCHADD and TFPD present with a rapidly progressive neonatal cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Infants may later develop recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycemia with acute catabolic illness resulting in liver dysfunction (a Reye-like syndrome), cardiomyopathy, myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis. Cholestasis may be present. Surviving individuals with LCHADD or TFPD may experience skeletal myopathy (65 percent), a slowly progressing peripheral neuropathy (21 percent), and pigmentary retinopathy (43 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Peripheral neuropathy in TFPD is earlier in onset and more severe than in those with LCHADD. Some patients may have severe liver disease with fibrosis in addition to necrosis and steatosis. Older children, adolescents, and adults may develop recurrent rhabdomyolysis during illness.</p><p>The majority of moderate to severe cases are identified by NBS. Diagnostic elevations of C16:1-OH-, C16-OH-, C18:1-OH-, and C18-OH-acylcarnitines are seen on plasma acylcarnitine analysis. Urine organic acid analysis shows longer-chain 3-hydroxydicarboxylic acids. Enzymatic diagnosis can be made in leukocytes or in skin fibroblasts, but a combination of clinical features, biochemical abnormalities, and <em>HADHA</em> or <em>HADHB</em> mutation analysis is often sufficient. A c.1528G&gt;C mutation causing an amino acid substitution p.E510Q in the TFP-alpha subunit accounts for approximately 90 percent of all LCHADD.</p><p>Treatment of LCHADD and TFPD involves avoidance of prolonged fasting, dietary fat restriction, and MCT supplementation. A low-fat diet and MCT supplementation decrease plasma hydroxyacylcarnitine levels and substantially reduce the risk of metabolic decompensation, but patients on this diet still require supplementation with essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may reduce the progression of retinal disease but typically does not prevent it. Patients continue to require prophylactic emergency management during illnesses and supportive care pre- and postoperatively. L-carnitine supplementation is controversial.

Avoiding essential fatty acid deficiency requires supplementation with essential fatty acids. Patients are also supplemented with MCT oil to provide a substrate for beta-oxidation.</p><p>The strictness of the diet may vary depending upon disease severity. In severe VLCADD, for example, the dietary total fat is limited to 25 to 30 percent of total calories with one-third long-chain fatty acid content, and discontinuation of breastfeeding may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In contrast, in milder cases of VLCADD, neonates may be allowed a more liberal goal of 30 to 40 percent of total calories from fat, including some breastfeeding. There is risk of essential fatty acid deficiency with these dietary restrictions. Thus, levels must be monitored through periodic measurement of essential fatty acid profile and appropriate supplementation provided as necessary.</p><p>MCT can be used in patients with LCFAODs because medium-chain fatty acids can enter mitochondria directly, thereby circumventing the block in long-chain fatty acid oxidation. MCT oil typically should provide 20 to 25 percent of total energy from the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The dose of MCT oil is 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day in three divided doses, which can be gradually increased to 1.0 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day. Excess MCT oil, however, can be converted into long-chain fats in adipocytes, which limits the effectiveness of this treatment. In one small study, most patients with an LCHADD remained without episodes of metabolic decompensation when on a low-fat diet with supplemental MCT, essential fatty acids, and fat-soluble vitamins and demonstrated decreased plasma hydroxyacylcarnitines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In patients with LCHADD or TFPD, pre-exercise &quot;loading&quot; with MCT oil reduced long-chain hydroxyacylcarnitines by 30 percent and increased beta-hydroxybutyrate levels threefold compared with those not given MCT oil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

It typically presents in older infants (18 to 36 months) during an infection with vomiting, poor oral intake, dehydration, lethargy, hypoglycemia, and seizures. The presentation is similar to Reye syndrome and leads to death from brain edema and hyperammonemia. Severe lethal presentations with sudden infant death may occur, including in the first few days of life prior to availability of newborn screening (NBS) results.</p><p>Historically, MCADD had a high mortality rate, but earlier diagnosis and treatment due to NBS have dramatically improved mortality and morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. NBS with acylcarnitine profiling reveals elevated C6-, C8-, C10-, and C10:1-species with an increased <span class=\"nowrap\">C8/C10:1</span> ratio. Urine acylglycine analysis may show elevation of propionylglycine, suberylglycine, and hexanoylglycine. Confirmation through DNA sequencing of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, C-4 to C-12 straight chain (<em>ACADM</em>) is available with a common mutation, c.985A&gt;G, accounting for 70 percent of mutant alleles in individuals of Northern European ancestry. Treatment focuses upon avoidance of prolonged fasting, especially during intercurrent illness. A diet high in carbohydrates and low in fat is recommended. Medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil should be avoided. Carnitine supplementation is usually not necessary, except in some patients with MCADD who have low free carnitine levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1571699699\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD; also known as glutaric acidemia type 2 [GA2]) is the result of a defect of electron transfer from all of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases through their physiologic electron acceptor (ETF to ETFDH) and finally to coenzyme Q10 in complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. ETF is made up of two subunits: ETFA and ETFB. Mutations in <em>ETFA</em> and <em>ETFB</em>, as well as the <em>ETFDH</em> gene, disrupt the flow of reducing equivalents and, thus, oxidative phosphorylation. Riboflavin is a precursor of the essential flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor for each of these enzymes, and riboflavin deficiency may mimic MADD. Riboflavin-responsive mutations of each of the above genes have also been described, most frequently in <em>ETFDH</em>.</p><p>Clinical presentations of MADD have an overlapping spectrum of symptoms that fall into three main categories: neonatal presentation with or without congenital anomalies and a later-onset form. The severe neonatal form can present with metabolic crisis, including metabolic acidosis, nonketotic hypoglycemia, and hyperammonemia; additional features include hypotonia, cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, &quot;sweaty feet&quot; odor, coma, and neonatal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. A rapidly progressing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy often occurs in the neonatal-onset forms, and the risk for sudden death is great even with prior detection through NBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Congenital malformations include enlarged polycystic kidneys, rocker-bottom feet, inferior abdominal musculature defects, hypospadias and chordee, hypotonia, cerebral cortical dysplasia, and gliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Dysmorphic features include telecanthus, malformed ears, macrocephaly, a large anterior fontanel, a high forehead, and a flat nasal bridge. The physical features resemble those seen in severe carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 2 deficiency (CPT2D). (See <a href=\"#H3220847698\" class=\"local\">'Carnitine palmitoyltransferase type 2 deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p>The later-onset form of MADD does not have congenital malformations but rather a lifelong risk of acute intermittent episodes that consist of vomiting, dehydration, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and acidosis, with hepatomegaly or a lipid storage myopathy in some older individuals. Episodes of acute decompensation may be triggered by infection, fever, surgery, low-energy diets or weight loss, alcohol, and pregnancy. Most of these patients develop chronic myopathic symptoms including exercise intolerance, myalgias, muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Associated secondary muscle coenzyme Q10 deficiency, primarily in adulthood, has been reported in some patients with <em>ETFDH</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Later-onset forms of disease are more likely to be riboflavin responsive.</p><p>A diagnosis of MADD is suspected with the combination of increased anion gap metabolic acidosis, lactic acidosis, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and hyperammonemia. A &quot;sweaty feet&quot; odor of isovaleric acid may be present. Diagnostic testing demonstrates elevations of metabolites from short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids; branched-chain amino acid; and sarcosine metabolism due to the various acyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzymes involved. Plasma acylcarnitine testing and NBS show elevations of C4-, C5-, C5DC-, C6-, C8-, C10:1-, C12-, C14-, C14:1-, C16-, C16:1-, C18-, C18:1-, C16-OH-, C16:1-OH-, C18-OH-, and C18:1-OH-acylcarnitines. Urine organic acid testing demonstrates elevations of ethylmalonic acid; glutaric acid; 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid; lactic acid; medium- and long-chain dicarboxylic acids; and isovalerylglycine, isobutyrylglycine, and 2-methylbutyrylglycine. Ketone bodies, including acetoacetic acid and 3-hydroxybutyric acids, are minimal or undetectable. Liver dysfunction leads to elevated serum transaminases and prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin times. Renal tubular dysfunction results in generalized aminoaciduria. Confirmation should include DNA sequencing of the genes <em>ETFA</em>, <em>ETFB</em>, and <em>ETFDH</em>. Enzyme testing is also available from liver biopsy or fatty acid oxidation probe analysis in fibroblasts but may not be necessary. Several <em>ETFDH</em> mutations lead to a milder, riboflavin-responsive phenotype with correction of clinical and biochemical parameters in some individuals with at least one these alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>The complex treatment plan requires a low-protein and low-fat diet; avoidance of prolonged fasting; and supplementation with carnitine, riboflavin (50 mg three times a day in young children, and 100 mg three times a day in older children and adults), and glycine (150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> divided three times a day). Patients with MADD due to <em>ETFDH</em> mutations who have coenzyme Q10 deficiency can additionally be treated with a coQ10 supplement (dose in children is 4 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day given once a day or in two divided doses). Metabolic formulas have to be individually designed to meet nutritional goals. Acute decompensation should be treated promptly with intravenous (IV) glucose and carnitine to restore anabolism, with close monitoring of cardiac, hepatic, and renal function. Ketone bodies represent a source of energy that patients with MADD can metabolize, and small trials of treatment with 4-hydroxybutyrate have shown some success, especially relative to cardiac function. However, larger studies are necessary to confirm initial results. (See <a href=\"#H4194617364\" class=\"local\">'L-carnitine supplementation in LCFAODs'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1367331227\"><span class=\"h2\">Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD) is diagnosed through elevations of C4-acylcarnitine and urinary ethylmalonic acid and butyrylglycine. Individuals with mild, moderate, and severely decreased enzyme function may be identified on NBS. Prior reports found that decreased SCAD enzyme activity was associated with a wide variety of symptoms including failure to thrive, poor feeding, hypotonia, and seizures. Subsequently, up to 14 percent of the normal population was found to be compound heterozygous or homozygous for one of two common polymorphisms (c.511C&gt;T and c.625G&gt;A) in the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, C-2 to C-3 short chain gene (<em>ACADS</em>) that reduce enzyme activity and lead to the biochemical abnormalities of SCADD but are of no physiologic consequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Rarer inactivating alleles have been described, including a common one in Ashkenazi Jews. Currently, all infants with SCADD detected on NBS have been reported to remain asymptomatic, leading many to consider SCADD to be a benign biochemical phenotype rather than a clinically relevant inborn error of metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Chronic treatment seems inadvisable, although the need for carnitine or riboflavin supplementation, or other acute management during illness, is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H148096050\"><span class=\"h2\">Short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, encoded by <em>HADH</em>, catalyzes the NAD<sup>+</sup> dependent oxidation of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA for C4 to C10 substrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. Unlike the trifunctional protein (TFP), SCHAD has only one enzymatic function. Most patients with proven <em>SCHAD</em> mutations have recurrent hypoglycemia that is associated with diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/60-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-65</a>]. Thus, short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCHADD) should be classified as a congenital hyperinsulinism syndrome. Symptoms are typically precipitated by stressors, fasting, or dietary protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Protein sensitivity and hyperinsulinism are related to a nonenzymatic function of the SCHAD protein, which interacts with glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in pancreatic islet cells to downregulate GDH activity, leading to gain of activity insulin sensitivity. To date, among cases with proven <em>HADH</em> mutations, skeletal and cardiomyopathies have not been present, differentiating this disorder from the longer-chain defects in trifunctional protein. All patients with SCHADD have presented within the first year of life. Late diagnosis can result in seizures and intellectual disability due to recurrent hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].
