Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85 percent of all lung cancers, of which, adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Traditionally, the histopathologic diagnosis of NSCLC has been made based upon information obtained from small biopsies. There has been a shift towards the use of therapies targeted at specific mutations, the identification of which can be challenging on low volume biopsy samples. This, together with the rising incidence of adenocarcinoma and its classification into subgroups, has led to greater emphasis on the importance of tissue biopsy for the diagnosis of NSCLC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>This topic will discuss the accuracy of procedures commonly used to obtain tissue for diagnosis and staging in patients with suspected NSCLC. The clinical presentation, initial evaluation and staging, and approach to the selection of modality for biopsy of patients with suspected NSCLC are discussed separately.

When an institution is equipped with reliable expertise, one of the minimally invasive or more invasive tools listed in the section below may be used to biopsy a target lesion. Importantly, estimates of sensitivity and specificity for individual modalities are usually based upon small studies with inadequate gold standard comparators that lead to bias and significantly limit interpretation of the data. Furthermore, the post-test probability of malignant disease particularly in metastatic locations will depend not only on patient risk factors, but also the local prevalence of alternative diagnoses such as granulomatous disease. The clinician should be aware of these clinically relevant limitations when choosing among the modalities available for tissue acquisition.<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-modality-for-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of modality for diagnosis and staging of patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H58288328\" class=\"local\">'Minimally invasive procedures'</a> below and <a href=\"#H58288497\" class=\"local\">'Surgical staging procedures'</a> below.)</p><p>Prior to biopsy the following should be in place:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thorough history and examination with routine laboratory studies.

Bronchoscopic techniques include endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), bronchial washings, brushings, forceps transbronchial biopsy, navigational-guided transbronchial biopsy, and conventional TBNA. Bronchoscopic techniques may be combined in a single procedure and this provides a potential advantage of obtaining both the diagnosis and staging at the same time. Percutaneous approaches include transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) or <span class=\"nowrap\">needle/core</span> biopsy (TTNB) of the primary tumor. A combination of bronchoscopic and percutaneous modalities may be necessary to permit sampling from several lesions or when the first modality is nondiagnostic. Selecting one of these procedures or combining several modalities to achieve the most accurate histologic classification and staging information relies on knowledge of the technique's diagnostic accuracy for the target lesion(s). Critical considerations for procedure selection also include patient-specific details like cardiopulmonary status and goals of care, as well as systems factors such as available equipment, laboratory resources, and operator proficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-modality-for-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H205761912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of modality for diagnosis and staging of patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Approach to the patient'</a>.)</p><p>The evidence for each minimally invasive procedure pertinent to its diagnostic and staging accuracy for NSCLC is discussed in this section. In general, the following applies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoscopy with EBUS-TBNA has gained wide acceptance as a first-choice diagnostic and staging procedure for thoracic mass lesions and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes that are accessible by this modality. This is due to its ability to establish both a cytologic diagnosis of lung cancer as well as its high diagnostic accuracy for sampling central lesions and lymph nodes in the paratracheal, subcarinal and hilar regions of the mediastinum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/4,6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-10</a>]. Limitations of EBUS-TBNA include inability to access retrotracheal, periaortic, paraesophageal and pulmonary ligament lymph node stations (3a, 5, 6, 8, 9) and variable operator proficiency, which may influence the rate of non-diagnostic findings. (See <a href=\"#H58288371\" class=\"local\">'Endobronchial ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although transthoracic (percutaneous) needle <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/biopsy</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(TTNA/TTNB)</span> has a high accuracy for diagnosing NSCLC, the higher risk of complications (eg, pneumothorax) is an important limitation, and it is rarely useful for mediastinal lymph node staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2,4,11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,11-16</a>]. TTNA may be used for peripheral nodules and masses, especially when lesions appear to directly involve the chest wall or skeleton, or as an alternate procedure when lesions cannot be safely or reliably accessed using another modality. (See <a href=\"#H58288399\" class=\"local\">'Transthoracic needle biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional flexible bronchoscopy with forceps biopsy, brushing, or washing is best utilized for accessing large, central lesions and those with suspected airway involvement. These lesions may present with hemoptysis or postobstructive pneumonia, and direct visualization reveals endobronchial involvement or obstruction (see <a href=\"#H58288335\" class=\"local\">'Conventional bronchoscopy'</a> below). Conventional bronchoscopy with blind transbronchial needle aspiration may be utilized for diagnosis and staging of significantly enlarged subcarinal, paratracheal, and hilar nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945 \">figure 1</a>). However, without ultrasound guidance, TBNA alone has limited sensitivity for staging of the mediastinum. The use of ultrasound guidance for tissue biopsy enhances the ability of bronchoscopy to sample lymph nodes and tumors outside the airways, making EBUS the preferred bronchoscopic modality for diagnosis and staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) using a transesophageal approach is a sensitive staging tool for suspected NSCLC in subcarinal and paratracheal nodes. EUS-FNA can be combined with EBUS-TBNA to enhance mediastinal staging. However, it requires special expertise.

Bronchoscopic TBNA can be performed based on computed tomography (CT) imaging and anatomic relationships (ie, conventional TBNA), or under real-time guidance by endobronchial ultrasound. Endobronchial ultrasound requires a special bronchoscope and image processors distinct from conventional flexible bronchoscopes. (See <a href=\"#H58288371\" class=\"local\">'Endobronchial ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>For primary lesions that are large or central, or for lesions that obstruct airways, the diagnostic sensitivity of conventional bronchoscopy with endobronchial or transbronchial biopsy is 65 to 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For similar, centrally located lesions, the use of needle aspiration (bronchoscopic-TBNA) increases the diagnostic sensitivity (70 to 96 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Bronchoscopy has a higher sensitivity for diagnosis of the primary tumor in this setting because proximal lesions in or close to the airway are easily visualized and accessed by this modality. However, for smaller peripheral lesions that are not visible endoscopically or are located distal to sub-segmental bronchi, the sensitivity decreases significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19</a>].

Conventional bronchoscopy with TBNA may also be appropriate in some cases when there is bulky, central mediastinal disease. However, conventional bronchoscopic TBNA without ultrasound guidance has a more limited role in mediastinal staging in most patients with hilar, paratracheal and smaller subcarinal lymph nodes because of its significantly lower sensitivity. Bronchoscopic-TBNA without real-time ultrasound guidance is inferior to EBUS-TBNA for the diagnosis and staging of NSCLC (sensitivity 36 versus 69 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/7-9,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,20,21</a>].

Specifically, bronchoscopy is necessary for assessing the proximal extent of central or endobronchial tumors (ie, tumor size [T]). Tumors that involve the mainstem bronchus (regardless of the distance from the carina but not involving the carina) are T2 lesions in the new American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8 staging system and tumors involving the carina are T4 lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806 \">table 2</a>).

Although the sensitivity varied widely with target site features (eg, size, location), the stepwise increment to the maximum sensitivity provided by serial passes was similar across target sites. In one study of 168 patients with hilar and mediastinal adenopathy, the addition of rapid on-site cytologic evaluation (ROSE) did not alter the sensitivity but did reduce the number of total needle passes and lowered the rate of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58288371\"><span class=\"h3\">Endobronchial ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EBUS is an endoscopic imaging tool that utilizes real-time ultrasonographic guidance to facilitate transbronchial needle aspiration as well as forceps, needle, or brush biopsies of peripheral lesions. Although there are important technical differences between conventional and EBUS-guided TBNA, such as the length of the needle used, the main benefit of ultrasound guidance is related to the ability to visualize anatomy and precisely localize suspicious lymph nodes or peripheral lung lesions. There are two distinct ultrasound designs used in bronchoscopy: linear EBUS and radial probe EBUS. Linear (ie, convex probe [CP]) EBUS is incorporated into the distal tip of a dedicated bronchoscope that guides TBNA. Linear-EBUS TBNA is ideally suited for sampling mediastinal lymph nodes or large, central masses. Radial probe (RP) ultrasound is catheter-based and deployed through the working channel of a conventional flexible bronchoscope and into subsegmental and distal airways to locate peripheral lesions and then to guide forceps or brush biopsies. Radial EBUS is most commonly used for diagnosis of parenchymal nodules or masses.

However, it is a potentially useful modality for the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer, particularly, in those with mass lesions that appear to involve the posterior and inferior mediastinum as well as the left paratracheal lymph nodes. EUS-FNA requires experienced, skilled endoscopists who have received specialized training. A limitation of EUS-FNA as a stand-alone diagnostic and staging procedure is its inability to simultaneously visualize the airway and access the primary tumor mass. For this reason, EUS is performed in some medical centers in tandem with bronchoscopy and EBUS-FNA.</p><p>EUS-FNA is a sensitive staging tool for suspected NSCLC involvement in subcarinal (3, 7, 8, 9) and paratracheal nodes (2, 4) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63771 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Traditionally, this procedure has not used video-assistance for sampling lymph nodes and has sampled nodes by biopsy forceps. Much of the evidence describing its performance as a staging modality relates to this particular approach. However, there has been a paradigm shift in the use of a video-assisted mediastinoscope to access the mediastinum. Videomediastinoscopy improves operator visualization, so that systematic lymph node sampling (by biopsy forceps) can be performed. When a video mediastinoscope is used to dissect and remove an entire lymph node, this is known as VAMLA which is discussed below.

One study of practice variation at four hospitals showed that guidelines for the use of mediastinoscopy in patients with suspected lung cancer, between the years of 1993 and 1999, were adequately followed in only two-thirds of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].

Alternatively, VATS can be used as a primary diagnostic modality when the probability of cancer is high and the tumor is easily accessible to wedge resection.</p><p>The main advantage of VATS is the direct visualization of and extensive access to the lung, thoracic cavity, and all mediastinal structures (eg, lymph nodes, vessels, and esophagus). This allows concurrent access to both the primary tumor and to almost all lymph nodes in the ipsilateral mediastinum (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 to 14) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945 \">figure 1</a>). Thus, VATS can easily evaluate the extent of invasion by the primary tumor (T), especially that of the chest wall and mediastinal structures, malignant mediastinal lymph node involvement (N), and pleural involvement with nodules or effusion (M1a) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>]. This approach permits rapid intraoperative diagnosis, staging and occasionally therapy, thereby shortening the time needed to diagnose and stage NSCLC. </p><p>VATS is a major surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia. Reaching the right side of the mediastinum with VATS is technically easier than reaching the left, particularly, the left paratracheal nodes (4L). In addition, although access to mediastinal node stations is extensive, typically only one side can be sampled. Occult disease on the contralateral side can be missed unless bilateral VATS is performed. However, bilateral VATS is not routinely performed for this indication because it greatly increases the morbidity and mortality of the surgery. The complications and procedural aspects of VATS and surgical management of mediastinal lymphadenopathy are discussed separately.

However, of the four studies included in this meta-analysis, the study that reported the lowest sensitivity (58 percent) was a multicenter study. The variability of results and low sensitivity seen in the multicenter study suggest wide differences in the accuracy of VATS for staging NSCLC or heterogeneity of patient populations. There are no studies that directly compare the diagnostic or staging accuracy of VATS to other staging modalities. </p><p>VATS has been shown to have value in the evaluation of T4 lesions. While some T4 lesions may be potentially operable (eg, large, &gt;7 cm and surrounded by normal lung with no nodal metastasis), most are not resectable (eg, large bulky tumors infiltrating the mediastinum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/104,124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,124,125</a>]. Further staging by VATS in this setting may either downstage the disease such that the patient may become a candidate for surgery or upstage it when unexpected metastatic disease of the pleura is found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/103,104,125-128\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,104,125-128</a>].

All patients were thought be ineligible for surgery based on their computed tomography (CT) scan characteristics (eg, pleural fluid, T4 lesions). Among the 30 patients with mediastinal infiltration on CT scan, nine (30 percent) were down-staged to potentially resectable status and two (7 percent) to resectable disease because mediastinal invasion was not confirmed. In addition, this study and others have reported that VATS can upstage the disease to stage IV by the identification of unsuspected pleural disease in 6 to 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,104</a>]. </p><p>VATS is frequently used to perform lobectomies in patients with peripheral nodules and suspected N0 or N1 disease.

However, it does not directly provide staging information for NSCLC, nor it is it likely to provide ideal specimens for immunohistochemical or molecular studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. &#160; </p><p>Pooled data from small observational series report sensitivity values of 66 percent (range 42 to 97 percent) for the diagnosis of NSCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Sensitivity varies by location of the primary tumor, being highest for large, centrally located lesions, and lower for smaller or peripheral lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Although cytologic specimens can be diagnostic of NSCLC, not every patient produces sputum. Thus, a negative test does not exclude the diagnosis of NSCLC and a second procedure will often be necessary for this purpose. Similarly, when sputum cytology is positive, additional testing will often be necessary for staging, especially when mediastinal or distant metastases are suspected. </p><p>Thus, in practice, sputum cytology is typically most useful in patients in whom avoiding a biopsy is desirable (eg, multiple comorbidities, contraindications to invasive biopsy, overwhelming evidence of metastatic disease). In this context, diagnostic sputum cytology may permit palliative or other therapy without the risk associated with biopsy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Selecting a modality depends upon knowledge of the diagnostic accuracy of a modality for the target lesion(s), in the context of operator proficiency, patient safety and eventual goals for treatment. While minimally invasive techniques are generally preferred to more invasive procedures, their imperfect sensitivity necessitates additional biopsy when testing is negative for cancer. Sensitivity and specificity estimates for individual modalities are usually based upon data from small studies with inadequate gold standard comparators that lead to bias and significantly limit interpretation of the data. The clinician should be aware of these flaws when choosing among the modalities available for tissue acquisition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-modality-for-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of modality for diagnosis and staging of patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoscopic techniques often employ multiple modalities (eg, forceps biopsy, brushings, ultrasound, needle aspiration) to increase the sensitivity for the diagnosis and staging of NSCLC. Bronchoscopy is best utilized for accessing large, visible, or central lesions and suspicious paratracheal and subcarinal nodes. As examples (see <a href=\"#H1229075713\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoscopic approaches'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Endobronchial-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is the first-choice modality for sampling large, central tumors and suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes in the paratracheal, subcarinal, and hilar regions (2R, 2L, 3p, 4R, 4L, 7, 10R, 10L, 11R, 11L) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945 \">figure 1</a>). Limitations of EBUS-TBNA include inability to access prevascular, periaortic, paraesophageal, or pulmonary ligament lymph node stations (3a, 5, 6, 8, 9), and variable proficiency among operators, which may influence the rate of nondiagnostic findings. (See <a href=\"#H58288371\" class=\"local\">'Endobronchial ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other image-guided bronchoscopic techniques are a emerging modalities for sampling peripheral lung lesions. (See <a href=\"#H1229076353\" class=\"local\">'Other image-guided bronchoscopic techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transthoracic (percutaneous) needle <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/biopsy</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(TTNA/B)</span> is a sensitive procedure for acquiring tissue for most intraparenchymal lesions, particularly peripheral masses and nodules. Although in theory it can access almost all mediastinal lymph nodal stations, it is rarely used for this purpose. It is often used to access peripheral lesions and can also be used when other procedures have failed. Results are sometimes nondiagnostic and there is a relatively high risk of pneumothorax. (See <a href=\"#H58288399\" class=\"local\">'Transthoracic needle biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a sensitive staging tool for suspected NSCLC involvement in subcarinal (3, 7, 8, 9) and paratracheal nodes (2, 4). EUS-FNA can be combined with EBUS-TBNA to enhance mediastinal staging. (See <a href=\"#H58288427\" class=\"local\">'Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasound'</a> above and <a href=\"#H58288455\" class=\"local\">'Combined modalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard cervical mediastinoscopy (SCM) is a sensitive staging procedure when sampling nodal stations easily accessed by this approach (1, 2, 3, 4, anterior 7, 10) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945 \">figure 1</a>). Use of a video mediastinoscope and systematic lymph node <span class=\"nowrap\">sampling/dissection</span> may enhance the accuracy of this modality. (See <a href=\"#H58288504\" class=\"local\">'Standard cervical mediastinoscopy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is an accurate modality for evaluating the extent of invasion (chest wall, mediastinal) by the primary tumor (T), mediastinal lymph node involvement (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 to 14) and pleural involvement (M) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945 \">figure 1</a>). It is a surgical procedure that requires general anesthesia and carries higher morbidity and mortality than other diagnostic or staging modalities. VATS is most often used when alternative procedures cannot access the primary tumor or are non-diagnostic. (See <a href=\"#H58288532\" class=\"local\">'Video-assisted thoracic surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left anterior mediastinotomy (Chamberlain procedure) is often the only option for sampling the subaortic (5) and para-aortic (6) lymph node stations. (See <a href=\"#H58288560\" class=\"local\">'Anterior mediastinotomy (Chamberlain procedure)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extended cervical mediastinoscopy (ECM), video-assisted mediastinal lymphadenectomy (VAMLA), and transcervical extended mediastinal lymphadenectomy (TEMLA) are surgical procedures that allow more extensive mediastinal sampling than standard cervical mediastinoscopy. They are not widely available and may be associated with greater morbidity than standard cervical mediastinoscopy. Using any one of these procedures is best dictated by the expertise of practitioners within the institution. (See <a href=\"#H58288567\" class=\"local\">'Extended cervical mediastinoscopy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H58288581\" class=\"local\">'Video-assisted mediastinal lymphadenectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H58288595\" class=\"local\">'Transcervical extended mediastinal lymphadenectomy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sampling site(s) of suspected metastatic disease is necessary for tissue confirmation. Sampling the pleural space (effusions or solid lesions) is essential in all patients with suspected pleural involvement. Thoracentesis is typically performed first for evaluation of pleural effusions. Pleural biopsy (image-guided or thoracoscopic) is often performed when pleural fluid cytology is negative or to obtain tissue from a solid pleural lesion. (See <a href=\"#H58288609\" class=\"local\">'Sampling metastatic disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1550887\" class=\"local\">'Suspected pleural metastases'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sputum cytology has diagnostic value in a small population of patients with suspected NSCLC. Sensitivity is highest for large, centrally located lesions, and lower for small peripheral lesions. It is not useful for staging NSCLC.
