Such disorders have traditionally been collectively termed renal osteodystrophy. However, disorders of bone and mineral metabolism in progressive CKD are frequently associated with abnormalities in cardiovascular structures and function, and bone is now recognized as an endocrine organ that plays an active role in the various metabolic abnormalities and in the cardiovascular complications commonly encountered in CKD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Consequently, an international work group convened in 2006 by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommended that the term, renal osteodystrophy, be exclusively used to define bone pathology associated with CKD. KDIGO recommended the term chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) be used to describe the much broader systemic disorder that occurs as a result of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>CKD-MBD is a systemic disorder that develops in the course of CKD and may manifest by one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), or vitamin D metabolism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume linear growth, or strength</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular or other soft-tissue calcification</p><p/><p>Renal osteodystrophy, as assessed by bone biopsy, includes osteitis fibrosa cystica, adynamic bone disease, osteomalacia, and a mixed lesion. Adynamic bone disease is a major form of renal osteodystrophy in both peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients, particularly diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-12</a>].

In order to understand the development and progression of bone disease in earlier stages of CKD, an increasing number of studies on bone disease in this population were carried out. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Work Group reviewed bone histology studies that were carried out between 1983 and 2006 and found that the prevalence of adynamic bone disease was 18 percent in CKD stages 3 to 5, 19 percent in hemodialysis patients, and 50 percent in peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The conclusion from this review was that adynamic bone disease has largely replaced that proportion of renal osteodystrophy previously resulting from osteomalacia and exceeded that of secondary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 1998 study of 56 dialysis patients from Thailand, bone biopsy in combination with other analysis revealed that low-turnover (adynamic) bone disease was present in 41 percent and high-turnover (osteitis fibrosa cystica) disease in 29 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2003 trial of 98 dialysis patients in Europe, bone biopsy showed low-turnover disease (defined as bone formation rate &lt;5 percent and osteoclast surface &lt;20 percent) and high-turnover disease in approximately 20 percent of patients each [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2008 study, bone biopsy revealed low-turnover disease in 59 percent of 119 hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In this study, there was an inverse association between serum sclerostin (a <span class=\"nowrap\">Wnt/beta-catenin</span> pathway inhibitor that decreases osteoblast action and bone formation) and the bone formation rate.</p><p/><p>Even among CKD patients not yet on dialysis, the prevalence of low-turnover disease has reportedly increased to between 12 and 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>]. In a bone biopsy study of 84 unselected patients with stage 5 CKD, adynamic bone disease was the most prevalent type of renal osteodystrophy, particularly in diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Suggested risk factors for adynamic bone disease include the use of calcium-containing phosphate binders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], high-dialysate calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and the use of active vitamin D analogs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Other possible risk factors include increased age and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The increased prevalence of low-turnover bone disease may thus reflect multiple factors, including changes in patients' demographics (older and increased numbers of diabetic patients), malnutrition, and changes in therapeutic strategies, such as the increased and earlier use of vitamin D analogs and calcium-containing phosphate binders and differences in dialysis techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>It is possible, however, that the spectrum of bone lesions seen in dialysis patients may change yet again in the future, particularly given the use of non-calcium-containing phosphate binders and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a>. In addition, the tendency for targeting a higher parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, as recommended by KDIGO, which recommends target PTH levels at two to nine times the upper limit of normal, may also result in resurgence of the formerly predominant lesions of osteitis fibrosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

This means that bone turnover is markedly reduced, and there is a lack of bone cell activity (both osteoblasts and osteoclasts). In contrast to osteomalacia, both the rate of collagen synthesis by osteoblasts and its subsequent mineralization are subnormal; thus, there is no increase in osteoid formation, as seen in osteomalacia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd#H312947\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD)&quot;, section on 'Abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume linear growth, or strength'</a>.)</p><p>The principal factor underlying adynamic bone disease is either oversuppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) release, which may be induced by the relatively high doses of vitamin D analogs and calcium-based phosphate binders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13,16,22,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,22,26,27</a>], or resistance to PTH actions on bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The role of calcium-based phosphate binders is suggested by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an animal model, adynamic bone was reversed with the administration of the non-calcium-based phosphate binder, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevelamer</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective bone biopsy study in 119 hemodialysis patients compared the effects of calcium-based phosphate binders on bone histology with that of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevelamer</a>. At the end of one year of treatment with either phosphate binder, a second bone biopsy was performed. The results showed no statistically significant differences in bone turnover or mineralization in patients treated with sevelamer compared with those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a>, but bone formation increased and trabecular architecture improved only with sevelamer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p>Although PTH levels in patients with adynamic bone disease are low, they tend to be higher than the upper limit of values in the healthy population. This indicates that resistance to the bone stimulatory effects of PTH may play an even larger role since normal PTH concentrations have been shown to be inadequate for maintaining bone turnover [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Although excess suppression of PTH is implicated in most cases, some patients treated with intermittent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> develop adynamic bone disease despite persistent hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Accruing evidence suggests that, in early stages of CKD, adynamic bone disease occurs first in a significant proportion of patients. In one study, patients with CKD stages 2 and 3 had lower bone formation rates, osteoid volume, and osteoblast surface than patients with stages 4 and 5 CKD and more prolonged mineralization lag time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In this study, there was a positive association between indoxyl sulfate levels and bone formation rate, osteoid volume, osteoblast surface, and bone fibrosis volume. It seems that uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate may induce low bone turnover in earlier stages of CKD when PTH levels are modestly elevated but resistance to its action is already present. Clinical and experimental studies have also shown that, in the initial stage of renal bone disease, uremic toxins lead to repression of osteocyte <span class=\"nowrap\">Wnt/beta-catenin</span> signaling and increase expression of Wnt antagonists such as sclerostin, Dickkopf-1, and SFRP4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. This suggests that adynamic bone disease starts as early as stage 2 CKD as a result of bone turnover&ndash;inhibitory factors, which include resistance to the action of PTH, reduced <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> levels, deficiency of sex hormones, diabetes, and repression of osteocyte <span class=\"nowrap\">Wnt/beta-catenin</span> signaling pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/17,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,31-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8511851\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with adynamic bone disease are asymptomatic, although some patients develop bone pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients with adynamic bone disease are at increased risk of fractures (likely due to an impaired ability to repair microdamage) and hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26</a>].</p><p>Vascular calcification may be observed on imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26</a>].

Although bone disease was not verified by biopsy in this study, multivariate analysis revealed that a plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) value of &lt;195 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/dL,</span> a value likely to be associated with adynamic bone disease, predicted fracture risk. Another observational study including &gt;9000 dialysis patients from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study (DMMS) Waves 1 to 4 identified a weak association between PTH concentration and risk for vertebral and hip fractures that was U-shaped, with the lowest risk observed around a PTH concentration of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(ng/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344986122\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypercalcemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with adynamic bone disease may develop hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The rise in plasma calcium is due, in part, to a marked reduction in the bone uptake of calcium after a calcium load, as with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> to treat hyperphosphatemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344986128\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular calcification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adynamic bone disease may predispose patients to vascular calcification.

A biopsy to document the presence of adynamic bone disease is reasonable among patients who have symptoms (ie, pain) and low or intermediate serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, especially if unexplained hypercalcemia or hypophosphatemia is present or if the patient has been exposed to aluminium (which causes osteomalacia) or is being considered for therapy with bisphosphonates. However, because it is invasive and requires special equipment and a great deal of expertise, bone biopsies are not commonly done outside the few academic centers with clinical research interest in metabolic bone disease.</p><p>There are no reliable biochemical markers that can be used in lieu of bone biopsy in predicting the type of underlying bone histology. However, we, and most other clinicians, use serum PTH and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase as surrogate biomarkers of adynamic bone disease and other forms of CKD-associated metabolic bone disease, although these markers have limited sensitivity and specificity to correctly classify bone disease in an individual patient with CKD.</p><p>Among dialysis patients, the diagnosis of adynamic bone disease is suggested by a persistently low intact serum PTH (ie, &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> especially if hypercalcemia is present.</p><p>Among patients who are not on dialysis, a PTH concentration that is persistently &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> may not reflect adynamic bone disease, especially if the serum calcium and phosphate concentrations are within normal. Among such patients, adynamic bone disease is suggested by a PTH concentration that was initially high and progressively decreases to less than the upper limit of normal for the PTH assay (generally 65 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> in the setting of treatment with active vitamin D analogs.</p><p>Among both dialysis and nondialysis CKD patients, intermediate PTH concentrations (ie, 100 to 450 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> are more difficult to interpret since such values do not exclude patients with adynamic bone disease.</p><p>Indeed, patients with PTH levels that are within the recommended Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative <span class=\"nowrap\">(K/DOQI)</span> targets of 150 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> have been shown to have biopsy-proven adynamic bone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Measurement of the serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentration may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis among patients with low or intermediate PTH concentrations.

Bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) cannot reliably distinguish among the various types of renal bone lesions.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-biopsy-and-the-diagnosis-of-renal-osteodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone biopsy and the diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75131699\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial approach to treatment of adynamic bone disease is to allow parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion to rise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This can be achieved by decreasing the doses of calcium-based phosphate binders and, perhaps, by using non-calcium-based phosphate binders; decreasing or stopping active vitamin D analogs; and, for patients on dialysis, possibly by using a low-dialysate calcium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,47,48</a>]. PTH goals are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>For all patients with biopsy-proven adynamic bone disease, we suggest using non-calcium-containing phosphate binders rather than calcium-containing phosphate binders. One randomized, prospective trial has suggested that the use of non-calcium-based binders may increase the bone formation rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among 68 hemodialysis patients who were randomly assigned to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevelamer</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a>, although there were no changes in bone turnover between groups at one year, the bone formation rate per bone surface increased from baseline in the sevelamer group, but not in the calcium carbonate group.</p><p>We also decrease or stop all active vitamin D analogs to allow the serum PTH concentration to increase. The effect of reducing or stopping active vitamin D analogs on reversing adynamic bone disease in dialysis patients remains uncertain since there are no large studies that examined the effect of vitamin D analogs on adynamic bone disease in dialysis patients, nor on the effect of stopping vitamin D analogs among patients with established adynamic bone disease. However, two studies in children on peritoneal dialysis who had high-turnover bone disease at baseline showed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> decreased the bone formation rate and induced adynamic bone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>The potential benefit on adynamic bone disease that is conferred by withdrawal of vitamin D therapy should be balanced against the survival benefits associated with vitamin D therapy that have been reported from observational studies, even in the presence of low PTH levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Administration of a physiologic dose of vitamin D may be appropriate, even in patients with adynamic bone disease. The optimal dose is not known and varies with the vitamin D analog that is used: We generally give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paricalcitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paricalcitol</a> 1 to 2 mcg intravenously with every dialysis session. However, other clinicians stop completely all vitamin D analogs among patients with adynamic bone disease.</p><p>Finally, we use low-calcium dialysate. Low-dialysate calcium concentration results in lower serum-ionized calcium and increased PTH level. This was suggested by a prospective trial including 51 patients treated with peritoneal dialysis who had biopsy-proven adynamic bone disease, in which two levels of dialysate calcium concentrations (3.25 or 2.00 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> were compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Repeat bone biopsies after 16 months showed that low-calcium dialysate led to normalization of bone formation rates as well as a 300 percent increase in PTH levels.</p><p>As noted above, most patients do not have biopsy-proven adynamic bone disease, but rather have the diagnosis suggested by the low PTH concentration. Our approach to patients who have not had a biopsy depends on our degree of confidence in the accuracy of the diagnosis of adynamic bone disease. (See <a href=\"#H75131693\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Among dialysis patients, the diagnosis of adynamic bone disease is suggested by a persistently low intact serum PTH (ie, &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> especially if hypercalcemia is present (see <a href=\"#H75131693\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above). Thus, for dialysis patients with PTH levels &lt;100, particularly those with hypercalcemia, we suggest reducing or stopping the active vitamin D analogs and allowing the PTH levels to rise. We also suggest switching to a non-calcium-containing phosphate binder and using a low-calcium dialysate (ie, 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>.</p><p>However, as noted above, among CKD patients who are not on dialysis, a PTH concentration that is persistently &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> may not reflect adynamic bone disease, especially if the serum calcium and phosphate concentrations are within normal. Among such patients, adynamic bone disease is suggested by a PTH concentration that was initially high and progressively decreases to less than the upper limit of normal for the PTH assay (generally 65 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> in the setting of treatment with active vitamin D analogs. (See <a href=\"#H75131693\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Thus, for such patients, we suggest not using active vitamin D analogs or calcium-containing phosphate binders.</p><p>As noted above, adynamic bone disease may be present among patients who have intermediate PTH concentrations (ie, levels between 100 and 450 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span>. In general, we measure the bone-specific alkaline phosphatase among patients with intermediate PTH concentrations who also have symptoms of bone pain or unexplained hypercalcemia or hypophosphatemia. A high alkaline phosphatase excludes the diagnosis of adynamic bone disease among such patients. A low or borderline alkaline phosphatase is consistent with, but does not establish, a diagnosis of adynamic bone disease. Such patients may undergo biopsy to establish the diagnosis prior to treatment for adynamic bone disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107230873\"><span class=\"h2\">Experimental therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of PTH, such as with the anabolic agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriparatide-recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-34-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teriparatide</a> (PTH 1-34), may benefit patients with adynamic bone disease. Teriparatide directly stimulates osteoblastic bone formation and has been tried in a small, prospective, open-labeled pilot study that included seven hemodialysis patients with adynamic bone disease and showed a significant increase in bone mineral density (BMD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In one dialysis patient with low bone turnover and frequent, disabling bone pain and fractures, a six-month, daily, subcutaneous injection of 20 micrograms of teriparatide lead to a resolution of bone pain and prevented further fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. A second transiliac bone biopsy demonstrated improvements in static and dynamic parameters of bone formation. However, we suggest not using teriparatide until further, larger studies have demonstrated efficacy and safety of this agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344984418\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adynamic bone disease is the most common form of renal osteodystrophy observed in dialysis patients, particularly diabetic patients and those on peritoneal dialysis. Over the last few decades, the prevalence of adynamic bone disease has increased relative to other forms of renal osteodystrophy and has been reported to be present in as high as 59 percent in some studies. (See <a href=\"#H8511412\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H75131426\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suggested risk factors for adynamic bone disease include the use of calcium-containing phosphate binders, high-dialysate calcium, and the use of active vitamin D analogs.

All patients with adynamic bone disease will have a normal or low alkaline phosphatase.
