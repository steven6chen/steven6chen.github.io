There are a variety of reasons that a case of pneumonia might resolve slowly or incompletely, including those relating to the etiology of the pneumonia (misdiagnosis of the pathogen or the presence of a resistant pathogen); those relating to the host, including mechanical processes; and the development of complications from the initial infection. In addition, noninfectious etiologies of pulmonary infiltrates can mimic infectious pneumonia, thus making it appear that resolution is not following the expected course. Approximately 20 percent of presumed nonresponding community-acquired pneumonia is due to noninfectious causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Despite the frequency of this problem, there has been a paucity of studies specifically addressing this issue.</p><p>In this review, we will use the term &quot;nonresolving pneumonia&quot; to include those cases of presumed pneumonia that progress, resolve slowly, or fail to achieve complete resolution despite what is thought to be appropriate therapy. We will first discuss those factors that normally affect the resolution of pneumonia, and we will then focus on specific causes of nonresolving pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and the approach to fever and pulmonary infiltrates in the immunocompromised patient are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration pneumonia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, and diagnosis of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the immunocompromised patient with fever and pulmonary infiltrates&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL VERSUS DELAYED RESOLUTION OF PNEUMONIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal resolution of pneumonia is not easily defined and may vary depending upon the underlying cause. Patients typically note subjective improvement within three to five days of treatment; more specific clinical criteria for resolution include improvement in tachycardia and hypotension, which are expected to improve in two days; fever, tachypnea, and arterial oxygenation (PaO<sub>2</sub>), which are expected to improve within three days; and cough and fatigue, which may take 14 days or longer to improve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74599\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74599 \">table 1</a>). The 2009 British Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia suggest that chest radiograph and hospitalization be considered for outpatients with pneumonia who fail to improve after 48 hours of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Most studies on the natural history of pneumonia have focused upon the resolution of chest radiographic abnormalities, with &quot;slow resolution&quot; often being defined as the persistence of radiographic abnormalities for greater than one month in a clinically improved host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Determining whether a patient has nonresolving or progressive pneumonia must also take into account several factors that affect the expected rate of resolution. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbidities &ndash; Comorbid conditions often slow the resolution of pneumonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62007\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62007 \">table 2</a>). Whereas patients without associated medical illnesses usually demonstrate clearing of radiographic infiltrates by four weeks, only 20 to 30 percent of patients with a comorbid condition will clear by four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ndash; Approximately 90 percent of patients younger than 50 years of age show radiographic resolution by four weeks, compared with only 30 percent of patients older than 50, even in the absence of concurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity &ndash; Radiographic resolution of severe pneumonia is estimated at 10 weeks, compared with three to four weeks for mild to moderate pneumonia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious agent &ndash; The rate of radiographic and clinical improvement varies with the particular infectious agent causing the pneumonia. In general, resolution is more rapid with <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, nonbacteremic <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Chlamydia</em> species, and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis </em>than with other organisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67206 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1186410740\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF NONRESOLVING PNEUMONIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of patients with an apparent nonresolving pneumonia generally centers around more detailed imaging studies and obtaining material for microbiologic and pathologic analysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52895\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef52895 \">algorithm 1</a>). While there are many potentially useful, noninvasive techniques to clarify the initial diagnosis, these may be limited by the difficulty of obtaining sputum in frail or immunocompromised patients. These groups are likely to constitute a larger proportion of those whose pneumonia fails to resolve. For example, heavy growth on expectorated sputum of a dominant organism would be extremely helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis but may be hampered by the difficulty of obtaining adequate sputum samples. Improved molecular and immunologic techniques for specific viral or bacterial pathogens have improved the diagnostic yield in patients with initial presentation of pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] but have not been studied in slowly or nonresolving pneumonia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1464768969\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic evaluation of treatment failure in pneumonia begins with a careful history, physical examination, and review of the medical record. Whether or not the rate of resolution is within the range of expected norms, taking into account the patient's underlying host factors, comorbidities, severity of illness, and suspected pathogen must be established. In stable or slowly improving pneumonia, especially in the presence of comorbidities or host factors that are known to delay the resolution of pneumonia, careful observation with or without therapy is warranted for four to eight weeks. If there is no resolution or progression of disease, a more aggressive diagnostic approach is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>If further evaluation is necessary, it should include appropriate basic laboratory studies as used in initial diagnosis and a chest computed tomography (CT) to look for sequestered areas of infection or for findings that suggest an alternative diagnosis. When pneumonia fails to resolve or when there is clinical progression, bronchoscopy should be considered. Patients with a negative bronchoscopic examination have a good chance of merely having a slowly resolving pneumonia, particularly if they are smokers or over age 55. Diseases not readily or typically diagnosed with bronchoscopy include pulmonary vasculitis syndromes, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage of various etiologies. With a worsening chest radiograph and progressive symptoms accompanied by a negative bronchoscopy, further evaluation with thoracoscopic or open lung biopsy may be necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52895\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef52895 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>The diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H872801849\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest CT, particularly high-resolution chest CT, is the primary radiographic tool for assessing treatment failure of a presumed pneumonia. Compared with conventional chest radiography, high-resolution chest CT allows superior detection of parenchymal abnormalities, including emphysema, airspace disease, interstitial disease, and nodules. Such findings may narrow the differential diagnosis or suggest new possibilities not previously under consideration. Chest CT also detects sequestered foci of infection, such as lung abscess and empyema, and helps direct biopsy procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High resolution computed tomography of the lungs&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3658083823\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relative ease and low risk of bronchoscopy make this the primary diagnostic procedure to obtain specimens from patients with a wide spectrum of possible infectious and noninfectious etiologies of nonresolving or progressive pneumonia. However, despite the frequency of its use for this indication, there are few studies that document the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy for nonresolving pneumonia.</p><p>Objective data suggest that bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy can successfully diagnose approximately 90 percent of patients who eventually have a specific diagnosis established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It is most likely to be useful in younger, nonsmoking patients with multilobar involvement and prolonged disease, whereas older adult patients, smokers, and those with immunodeficiency are more likely to have a nondiagnostic bronchoscopy and to have a slowly resolving pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Bronchoscopy is particularly useful to exclude mycobacteria or fungi if not detected with expectorated sputum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Development of endobronchial ultrasound has improved the value of bronchoscopy and should be considered as an alternative to mediastinoscopy when mediastinal lymph nodes are enlarged (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52895\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef52895 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H764726755\"><span class=\"h2\">Thoracoscopic or open lung biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors need to be considered when deciding to proceed to a more invasive biopsy procedure, such as thoracoscopic or open lung biopsy. A previous nondiagnostic bronchoscopy, concern about the specific patient's risk or ability to tolerate bronchoscopy, or the need for obtaining larger specimens of tissue for certain diagnoses may all support the need for proceeding to thoracoscopic or open lung biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52895\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef52895 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INFLUENCE OF SPECIFIC BACTERIAL PATHOGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are available regarding resolution of pneumonia caused by different etiologic agents, including factors that affect the course of particular types of pneumonia. It should be noted that the empiric approach to treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) suggested by most guidelines can result in failure to treat appropriately when pneumonia is the result of less common pathogens, like anaerobes and fungi.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because pneumococcal pneumonia represents the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, it also is responsible for most cases of nonresolving pneumonia syndromes that are due to infection. In normal individuals without predisposing illness, clinical improvement is relatively rapid and precedes radiographic improvement. The maximum temperature generally decreases over the first 48 to 72 hours in patients with lobar pneumonia but may not resolve completely for several more days; however, only 6 percent of patients remain febrile beyond 20 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Risk factors for delayed resolution of auscultatory findings and fever include more severe presentation, multilobar disease, and infection with drug-resistant organisms. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Resistant bacterial pathogens'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in the outpatient setting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-who-require-hospitalization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults who require hospitalization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiographic improvement is often much slower, with 20 to 30 percent of patients demonstrating no radiographic improvement after one week. Initial worsening of the chest radiograph is common. Risk factors for delayed radiographic resolution include bacteremia, persistent fever or leukocytosis beyond six days, advanced age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alcoholism, and HIV.</p><p>Radiographic clearing occurs by one to three months in nonbacteremic cases and three to five months in bacteremic cases. Residual radiographic abnormalities are rare in nonbacteremic cases but are present in up to 35 percent of bacteremic cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Legionella infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the risk factors for development of <em>Legionella</em> are also risk factors for delayed resolution. These include cigarette smoking, alcoholism, age greater than 65 years, immunosuppression (especially glucocorticoid use), chronic kidney disease, and hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplantation. As a result, the rate of resolution for <em>Legionella</em> infection is usually slower than for other organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Legionella infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiographic, but not necessarily clinical, deterioration despite treatment is common, occurring in up to two-thirds of patients with <em>Legionella</em>, compared with 4 percent of patients with nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia. In addition, after this initial deterioration, resolution is slow, with clearing beginning only after two to three weeks and approximately one-half of patients demonstrating residual abnormalities at 10 weeks. Resolution may take as long as 6 to 12 months, and residual fibrosis may be evident in up to 25 percent of patients.</p><p>In addition to the slowly resolving or residual radiographic abnormalities, patients may experience generalized weakness and fatigue for months. Residual abnormalities on pulmonary function testing may be seen as long as two years later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Mycoplasma pneumoniae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>M. pneumoniae</em> is a common cause of respiratory tract infection but a rare cause of severe pneumonia. Resolution is typically rapid and faster than that with other types of pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Significant clinical improvement usually occurs within the first two weeks, which may in part reflect the predominantly young and otherwise healthy population affected.</p><p>Radiographic deterioration after treatment is rare, occurring in less than 25 percent of cases. The average duration of radiographic abnormalities is two to four weeks, depending upon the use of antibiotics. Forty percent have complete radiographic resolution at four weeks and 90 percent at eight weeks. Residual radiographic abnormalities are distinctly unusual. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Chlamydia pneumoniae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. pneumoniae</em> infection is an uncommon cause of pneumonia, but it has been implicated in outbreaks of pneumonia in residents of long-term care facilities and military recruits. It is a relatively mild disease, and mortality is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Prompt resolution is the rule in younger patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumonia caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiographic deterioration is uncommon, with clearing typically occurring in less than three months. Fifty percent of chest radiographs clear within four weeks, while up to 20 percent take longer than nine weeks. Residual radiographic abnormalities persist in 10 to 20 percent of cases. Much information regarding <em>Chlamydia</em> resolution is derived from observations of patients with psittacosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Haemophilus influenzae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> is commonly considered a cause of pneumonia, especially in older adults, in cigarette smokers, and in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. However, several large series following the widespread use of conjugate vaccines against <em>H. influenzae</em> type b in children have shown a decreasing incidence of infection and a shift to nontypeable strains compared with the more invasive type b infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of Haemophilus influenzae&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The natural history of <em>H. influenzae</em> infection has not been well studied, but there do not appear to be any unique features regarding its resolution. Based on the propensity for the organism to infect the immunocompromised and older adults, resolution is often slow, with many patients having prolonged hospitalization. Only 50 percent of patients return to their previous level of function by six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MISDIAGNOSIS OF PATHOGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternative pathogens in addition to the usual bacterial causes of pneumonia need to be considered in the patient who fails to respond to treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78779\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78779 \">table 4</a>). Particularly important pathogens in this category include mycobacteria (either <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> or atypical mycobacteria), fungi, <em>Nocardia</em>, and <em>Actinomyces</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tuberculosis is of significant concern, especially in older adult patients and in those who have immigrated within the past five years, those who have a history of intravenous drug use, and those who have other risk factors for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</p><p>The clinical presentation of tuberculosis as a cause of nonresolving pneumonia is often atypical, especially in diabetics and in older adult patients, who commonly have radiographic findings in the middle or lower lung zones. Diagnosis may be difficult as sputum is not always available and culture results take weeks after the specimen is obtained. Polymerase chain reaction testing has been approved for smear-positive specimens to allow confirmation of tuberculous disease, but its role in smear-negative cases is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and complications of pulmonary tuberculosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Fungi</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both opportunistic and endemic fungal infections can mimic bacterial pneumonia. In the patient with an apparent nonresolving pneumonia, <em>Aspergillus</em> is a particularly important pathogen, presenting either as chronic necrotizing or as invasive aspergillosis. Patients with advanced AIDS are at increased risk of invasive aspergillosis, while patients with less advanced disease may develop tracheobronchitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82627\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82627 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Although invasive aspergillosis classically occurs in neutropenic patients who have been on multiple antibiotics for several days, it is increasingly recognized in older adult patients with chronic lung disease who are on corticosteroids. <em>Aspergillus</em> in this setting may mimic a bacterial infection, and one series demonstrated that patients with invasive aspergillosis were treated for an average of 18 days with multiple antibiotics before the diagnosis was established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of invasive aspergillosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Endemic fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, and cryptococcosis should be considered as a cause of nonresolving pneumonia in the appropriate endemic areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74059\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74059 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These include the Mississippi River valley for histoplasmosis, the southwestern United States for coccidioidomycosis, and the southeast and Midwest for blastomycosis. Each of these fungi can cause a nonspecific acute febrile illness, which may be confused with community-acquired pneumonia. Histoplasmosis has worldwide distribution and should be considered in travelers to high-prevalence countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Nocardia and Actinomyces</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although <em>Nocardia</em> and <em>Actinomyces </em>are higher-order bacteria, the clinical presentation of infection due to these organisms is more consistent with a fungal etiology. <em>Nocardia</em> infection presents most commonly on chest radiograph as a localized alveolar infiltrate that is usually homogeneous, nonsegmental, and cavitary. Infection due to <em>Actinomyces</em> has a similar appearance but with a propensity to extend across fissures and invade the chest wall.

Although penicillin-resistant <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> (pneumococcus) is the organism of most concern, multidrug-resistant <em>H. influenzae</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> as well as methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> are increasingly recognized in the community setting as possible causes of a nonresolving or recurrent pneumonia.

It is important to consider the possibility of underlying HIV infection in patients with nonresolving or progressive pneumonia. The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends routine testing for HIV infection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia between the ages of 15 and 54 occurring in hospitals in which the rate of newly diagnosed HIV infection exceeds 1 case per 1000 discharges.

This was illustrated in a review of 3675 patients with CAP in which empyema was diagnosed by the attending physician in 1.3 percent and by strict laboratory criteria in 0.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The patients with empyema were more likely to be younger and to be illicit drug users. The most common cultured pathogen was <em>Streptococcus milleri</em>, suggesting a role for aspiration.

In a patient with nonresolving pneumonia, demonstration of any significant amount of pleural fluid should prompt consideration of a diagnostic thoracentesis to rule out empyema.

The major pathogens are <em>Peptostreptococcus</em> spp, <em>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</em>, and <em>Fusobacterium</em> <em>nucleatum</em>. These infections are often subtle in onset and relatively slow in progression. Patients typically present with fever, night sweats, weight loss, cough, dyspnea, and putrid sputum with or without pleurisy.</p><p>Predisposing factors that should raise the suspicion of abscess formation include alcoholism, seizures, poor oral hygiene, and previous aspiration. Chest radiography typically demonstrates an air-liquid level in a dependent segment (posterior segment of an upper lobe or posterior segment of a lower lobe), but chest CT is more sensitive and can confirm the diagnosis in difficult cases.</p><p>Most patients with lung abscess do well with conservative management and a prolonged course of antibiotics. However, several factors are associated with increased abscess-related mortality and may warrant a more aggressive approach. These include age-related factors (pediatric or older adult populations), large cavity size, longer duration of symptoms prior to therapy, lower lobe location, association with malignant disease, and the presence of multiple abscesses. The development of infection in preexisting bullae may be mistaken for lung cancer.

Bronchogenic carcinoma and carcinoid tumors are the most common cause of endobronchial obstruction leading to pneumonia, whereas bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma (adenocarcinoma in situ) and lymphoma are the most common causes of an alveolar infiltrate mimicking pneumonia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchogenic carcinoma compromises the airway lumen either through endobronchial involvement or extrinsic compression. However, the frequency of endobronchial carcinoma as a cause of nonresolving pneumonia is relatively low, ranging from 0 to 8 percent in most series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endobronchial obstruction by a carcinoid tumor is an important predisposing factor for a postobstructive pneumonia and should be considered as a possible etiology for endobronchial obstruction in a young or nonsmoking patient.

Lymphoma affecting the lung parenchyma may occur either as part of a systemic disease or as primary pulmonary lymphoma. Three categories of clonal lymphoid proliferation are now recognized as producing pulmonary parenchymal involvement: low-grade B cell lymphoma arising from mucosal tissue (MALT), high-grade B cell lymphoma, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Primary pulmonary lymphoma is unusual, with only 10 percent of Hodgkin lymphoma and 4 percent of non-Hodgkin lymphomas presenting with an alveolar infiltrate. As the disease progresses, lung involvement becomes more common, occurring in 38 percent of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and 24 percent with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Chest CT may be particularly useful in patients with suspected Hodgkin lymphoma, since mediastinal lymphadenopathy is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresolving-pneumonia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Idiopathic BOOP usually begins with a flu-like illness mimicking an atypical (community-acquired) pneumonia, with fever, malaise, fatigue, dyspnea, and dry cough. Patients may have an elevated sedimentation rate and leukocytosis. Patchy alveolar infiltrates are typically present on chest radiograph, often mimicking a pneumonia.

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia typically presents as a subacute illness with cough, fever, dyspnea, weight loss, wheezing, night sweats, and radiographic infiltrates appearing over weeks to months. Chest radiographs often demonstrate patchy, nonsegmental alveolar infiltrates that predominantly affect the periphery of the lungs, sparing the central and basilar regions.
