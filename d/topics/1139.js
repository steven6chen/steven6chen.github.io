Most children with intussusception develop the sudden onset of intermittent, severe, crampy abdominal pain, accompanied by inconsolable crying and drawing up of the legs toward the abdomen, but some present with bloody diarrhea. The episodes of pain usually occur at 15 to 20 minute intervals. They become more frequent and may be followed initially by emesis of gastric contents. Bilious emesis may develop as the obstruction progresses. Between the painful episodes, the child may behave normally. As a result, initial symptoms can be confused with gastroenteritis. As symptoms progress, increasing lethargy develops, which can be mistaken for meningitis. A sausage-shaped abdominal mass may be felt, on occasion, in the right side of abdomen. The diagnosis is established by abdominal ultrasound or air contrast enema.

Infection in humans occurs following ingestion of contaminated undercooked meat, unpasteurized milk or milk products, water, fruits or vegetables, or coming into contact with animals in petting zoos.

It complicates 6 to 9 percent of enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em> infections with the 0157:H7 strain and usually begins 5 to 10 days after the onset of diarrhea. HUS, which has a sudden onset, is characterized by the triad of (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical and laboratory manifestations'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombocytopenia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute renal failure</p><p/><p>Children typically have a prodromal illness with abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea that precedes the development of HUS by a few days, as a result of which a patient may have no signs of hemolysis or renal failure when seen earlier in the course. The diarrhea and associated gastrointestinal complaints may mimic those of ulcerative colitis, other enteric infections, and appendicitis. The diagnosis of HUS in children is generally made on clinical grounds based on the characteristic clinical and laboratory findings previously described: a prodrome of diarrhea due to a Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli</em>, followed by abrupt onset of the characteristic triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury.

The typical presentation is acute watery diarrhea with lower abdominal pain, low-grade fever, and leukocytosis, starting during or shortly after antibiotic administration. Occasionally the course can be fulminant, progressing from diarrhea to toxic megacolon and shock. Community-associated infection with a highly toxigenic strain of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> has been reported in otherwise healthy children who had minimal or no exposure to antibiotics.

The presumed mechanism for the diarrhea is irritation of the colon by the inflamed appendix. The stools are usually of low volume and with mucus.

This is particularly true in very young children or among patients of any age who have both a perforated appendix and a long duration of illness. However, abdominal tenderness may be greater than would be expected with gastroenteritis. An approach to the diagnosis of appendicitis is provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96236\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96236 \">algorithm 2</a>).

Signs and symptoms of acute colitis that are frequently resistant to therapy are often present for at least one week prior to the onset of acute dilatation. Severe bloody diarrhea is the most common presenting symptom, while improvement of diarrhea may herald the onset of megacolon. Physical examination invariably reveals a toxic appearing patient with altered sensorium, tachycardia, fever, postural hypotension, lower abdominal distension and tenderness, with or without signs of localized or generalized peritonitis. However, large doses of steroids, analgesics, or a clouded sensorium may mask the signs or symptoms of toxic megacolon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxic-megacolon#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxic megacolon&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of toxic megacolon should be considered in all patients presenting with abdominal distension and acute or chronic diarrhea. The diagnosis is clinical, based upon the finding of an enlarged dilated colon on abdominal imaging accompanied by severe systemic toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxic-megacolon#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxic megacolon&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p>Toxic megacolon can occur as a complication of <em>Shigella</em> infection, pseudomembranous colitis, Hirschsprung disease, or inflammatory bowel disease.

They are caused by a variety of inherited disorders that disrupt nutrient digestion, absorption, or transport, enterocyte development and function, or enteroendocrine function. Although they are not usually life-threatening, congenital secretory diarrheas may lead to profound dehydration in the young infant over a short course of time.

In one series of children 2 months to 2 years of age, a viral etiology was identified in 60 percent of all cases of diarrhea and in 85 percent of moderately severe and severe episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a prospective case control study that evaluated the infectious etiology of diarrhea in 254 children with a median age younger than 2 years coming to a pediatric emergency department, a viral etiology was identified in 54 percent of patients while virus isolation only occurred in 5 percent of matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The incubation time from exposure, predominant season, severity and duration of illness depends upon the specific virus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80471\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80471 \">table 3</a>). Stool testing for specific viruses is typically not necessary but may be employed during outbreaks to determine the etiology.

With ingestion of these mushrooms, symptoms occur within one to three hours and include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping as well as diarrhea. Close attention to the history of ingestion and the timing associated with the onset of symptoms is important to differentiate acute gastroenteritis from the more concerning delayed gastroenteritis that may indicate consumption of a more lethal variety of mushroom toxins (eg, amatoxins, gyromitrin, orellanine).

Parasitic infections merit consideration as well, particularly in individuals with a history of recent immigration, travel to an underdeveloped country, or backcountry camping.</p><p>The child with chronic diarrhea who is well-appearing and tolerates oral fluids can be managed as an outpatient. The key factor in successfully diagnosing the etiology of the diarrhea is reliable follow-up with a primary care provider or, when serious underlying disease is suspected, referral to a pediatric specialist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1952971436\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

The table summarizes the causes of diarrhea, highlighting the most common and the most life threatening pediatric conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58814\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58814 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Acute diarrhea (duration &lt;5 days)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of fever and bloody or mucousy diarrhea are two features of acute diarrheal illness, either alone or in combination, that are particularly helpful in sorting through the differential diagnosis, particularly in otherwise healthy, well appearing children. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Algorithmic approach to the patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient with acute diarrhea who requires volume resuscitation must be quickly identified. Clinical evidence of dehydration such as decreased urine output, tachycardia, and dry mucus membranes are already apparent at a deficit of 5 percent of body weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76198\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76198 \">table 4</a>). The most useful signs for predicting a volume deficit of 5 percent or more include delayed capillary refill time greater than 2 seconds, reduced skin turgor, and deep respirations with or without an increase in respiratory rate, particularly if a combination of these findings is present. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to identifying volume depletion, a thorough examination must be performed because systemic, non-enteric infections, particularly otitis media, may cause acute diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H3408865928\" class=\"local\">'Extraintestinal infections'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A palpable mass or peritonitis suggests appendicitis, intussusception or, less commonly, toxic megacolon. Generalized toxicity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shock may occur with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or with sepsis, such as from <em>Salmonella</em> or staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Life-threatening conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ancillary studies in children with acute diarrhea are based upon a careful history and physical examination. Most previously healthy children with self-limited diarrhea (eg, viral gastroenteritis, extraintestinal infections, functional diarrhea, starvation stools, or transient lactase deficiency) and no exposures to bacterial pathogens require no specific testing. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing and imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A brief initial evaluation of the child with chronic diarrhea in the acute setting (eg, emergency department) is described above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57713\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57713 \">algorithm 3</a>).
