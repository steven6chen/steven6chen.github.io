There are changes in the brains of people with DLB. The changes are called Lewy bodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15630520\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of DLB?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems making decisions, thinking clearly, or paying attention. These can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Problems driving &ndash; A person with DLB might get lost, not know how far it is from one place to another, or not see other cars.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Problems at work</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Memory problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A shorter attention span than normal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Problems figuring out how to do normal daily activities</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seeing things that are not really there &ndash; Doctors call these &quot;hallucinations.&quot; They can include colors, shapes, animals, or people.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being sleepy, staring at things, or acting strangely &ndash; The person might take long naps during the day. The times of being sleepy, staring, or acting strangely can last a few minutes or several days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Movement problems &ndash; These are similar to the movement problems caused by another brain disorder, called Parkinson disease. They can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stiffness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Slow movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trouble walking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trembling</p><p/><p>Other DLB symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting out dreams while sleeping &ndash; The person might hit someone, eat, talk, or do other things they are dreaming about.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Falling down often</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting or losing consciousness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leaking urine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Believing things that are not true &ndash; For example, a person with DLB might believe his or her house is not really home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15630535\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You should see a doctor or nurse if you think you or someone close to you shows signs of DLB. The problems might be caused by a different condition that doctors can treat. For example, people with diabetes might act confused if their blood sugar is not under control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15630550\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and talk with you about your symptoms. He or she will also ask people who are close to you about any symptoms they notice.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse might do tests to see if you have DLB or a different problem. These tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Answering questions and doing certain tasks &ndash; These tests can tell the doctor how well your brain is working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests, such as an MRI &ndash; An MRI creates pictures of the brain. It can show changes in the brain, including other conditions that could be causing symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p>Depending on the results, you might have other tests. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called an &quot;electroencephalogram&quot; (also called an EEG) &ndash; This test measures electrical activity in the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called a &quot;sleep study&quot; &ndash; In this test, you spend the night in a lab at the hospital or doctor's office. You are hooked up to machines that measure your heart rate, breathing, and other body functions. The results tell your doctor more about any sleep problems you have.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15630567\"><span class=\"h1\">How is DLB treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no specific treatment for DLB. The symptoms get worse over time, but doctors can help treat the symptoms. Treatments include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to help with symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy to help with movement problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devices, such as a walker or cane, to help with balance problems such as falling down often. </p><p/><p>Your doctor might also recommend things to reduce stress. These include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A regular routine &ndash; Avoiding things that cause confusion or strange behavior can help with DLB. Having a regular routine at night can be especially helpful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spending time with pets or listening to music</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finding someone to help take care of the person with DLB &ndash; This can make it easier for the person's main caregiver, such as his or her husband or wife, to get enough rest.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15630582\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I stay safe?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have DLB, you might not realize how much it affects you. Trust your family and friends to tell you when it is not safe for you to drive, cook, or do other things that could be dangerous.</p><p>People with DLB often fall and hurt themselves. To reduce the risk of falling, it is a good idea to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure your rugs are attached to the floor, or use non-skid backing on them.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuck away loose wires or electrical cords.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear sturdy, comfortable shoes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep walkways well lit.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use hand rails on steps, in the shower, and other places where it can be hard to keep your balance.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15630599\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mild-cognitive-impairment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mild cognitive impairment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=parkinson-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Parkinson disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-falls-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preventing falls (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=parkinson-disease-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Parkinson disease symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
