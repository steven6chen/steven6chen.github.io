Thyroid ultrasound, in conjunction with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, plays an important role in the evaluation of a patient with a suspected thyroid nodule. The use of ultrasound-guided thyroid biopsy is reviewed here. Other clinical uses of thyroid ultrasonography and an overview of thyroid biopsy, including palpation-guided techniques, limitations, and complications, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical utility of ultrasonography in thyroid disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630736\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC ULTRASOUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid ultrasound should be performed in all patients with a suspected thyroid nodule or nodular goiter on physical examination or with nodules incidentally noted on other imaging studies (carotid ultrasound, computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography [FDG-PET] scan). There is increasing evidence that the presence of suspicious ultrasound features is more predictive of malignancy than nodule size alone. The decision to biopsy a thyroid nodule should be based upon a combination of ultrasonographic features, a history of factors that increase the risk of thyroid cancer (such as radiation exposure during youth), recent enlargement sustained by the nodule, nodule size, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> associated painless lymphadenopathy. This topic is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27370272\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR ULTRASOUND-GUIDED FNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is the procedure of choice for evaluating thyroid nodules and selecting candidates for surgery. If the presence of a thyroid nodule and indication for FNA is confirmed by diagnostic ultrasound and the nodule corresponds to what is palpated on physical examination, FNA can be performed directly without ultrasound guidance. However, ultrasound guidance is often preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Compared with palpation-guided FNA, the use of ultrasound improves the cytologic diagnostic accuracy rate and reduces the nondiagnostic rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. In a retrospective evaluation of 9683 patients with thyroid nodules, 4986 and 4697 patients were evaluated by palpation and ultrasound-guided FNA, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The nondiagnostic rate was significantly higher after palpation-guided FNA (14.1 versus 8.5 percent). Over a 15-year period, over 1000 nodules were resected because of suspicious or malignant cytology on palpation or ultrasound-guided FNA. The false-negative rate was higher in nodules that were biopsied via palpation rather than ultrasound (2.3 versus 1 percent). </p><p>When available, we suggest ultrasound-guided FNA for the majority of nodules. Ultrasound-guided FNA is essential for those nodules that are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpalpable or difficult to palpate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Predominantly cystic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nondiagnostic after palpation-guided FNA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small and located in close proximity to blood vessels</p><p/><p>In addition, we typically use ultrasound to guide FNA in an area in a goiter that is different from the rest of the goiter (ie, firmer, painful, tender, growing, or has suspicious ultrasonographic characteristics) for assessment of recurrent thyroid cancer and for nonpalpable lymphadenopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpalpable or difficult to palpate nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpalpable thyroid nodules that are noted as an incidental finding during a radiologic procedure, such as carotid ultrasonography, neck computed tomography (CT), or positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, are called incidentalomas. These nonpalpable nodules have the same risk of malignancy as palpable nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/2,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,9</a>]. In some settings, especially nodules discovered on PET scan, the risk of malignancy may be higher (30 to 50 percent), but in other settings (cystic nodules), it may be lower. The initial evaluation of an incidentally discovered nodule should include a dedicated thyroid ultrasound to confirm the presence of nodularity, assess sonographic features, and determine the need for FNA. If FNA is indicated, it must be performed using ultrasound guidance.</p><p>In some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,11</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], reports, the success of ultrasound-guided cytological diagnosis of non-palpable nodules depends on the size of the lesion. As an example, in one study of 1440 nodules &le;10 mm in size, the likelihood of obtaining adequate material for cytological analysis was significantly better with nodules &gt;6 mm compared with 2 to 6 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. For nodules measuring &gt;6 mm, the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound-guided FNA were 91.1 and 98.5 percent, respectively. In contrast, a study of aspirates from 317 nodules in 267 patients reported that the size of nonpalpable nodules (mean 0.9&plusmn;0.3 cm, with a range of 0.2 to 1.5 cm) was not related to the probability of getting an adequate specimen for cytological diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Another group also reported comparable success in aspirating nodules that were 4 to 10 mm in size compared with larger nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>We generally do not routinely aspirate nodules smaller than 10 mm, as recommended by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines and supporting literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In patients without risk factors for thyroid cancer or suspicious ultrasound findings, we perform periodic ultrasonography (initially at 6 to 12 months, then at increasing intervals over time, assuming stability) to monitor for growth. However, in selected, higher than average cancer-risk patients, we have had limited diagnostic success in sampling incidentalomas as small as 5 mm and greater than 70 percent success with nodules at least 8 to 10 mm. Indications for FNA and the monitoring of small nodules that are not biopsied are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules#H1586261\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;, section on 'Sonographic criteria for FNA'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules#H1585697\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;, section on 'Monitoring of nodules that do not meet FNA criteria'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630788\"><span class=\"h2\">Cystic nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mixed solid and cystic (complex) nodules offer a cytological diagnostic challenge. The diagnostic accuracy of FNA performed by palpation is reduced in nodules with &gt;25 to 50 percent cystic component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. When ultrasonography shows a solid component that is either small or posteriorly located, ultrasound-guided FNA directed at the solid component or the cyst wall may reduce the risk of a nondiagnostic result. In general, pure cysts should not be aspirated, unless it is to alleviate compressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Purely cystic lesions rarely contain cancer, but the likelihood of cancer in complex (cystic and solid) nodules approaches that of solid nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The evaluation and management of cystic thyroid nodules is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-thyroid-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic thyroid nodules&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nondiagnostic aspirates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 15 to 20 percent of percutaneous thyroid biopsies are insufficient or nondiagnostic. The highest frequency of nondiagnostic cytology results occurs in cystic nodules and in very small nonpalpable nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>]. The diagnostic yield of sampling palpable nodules is enhanced when ultrasound-guidance is employed, especially when a prior aspiration was unsuccessful because the nodule had undergone cystic deterioration. If ultrasound-guided FNA is nondiagnostic, a repeat ultrasound-guided FNA will yield a diagnostic cytology specimen in 75 percent of solid nodules and 50 percent of cystic nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Especially if there is any very sparse or no aspirated material, using a larger lumen needle may result in a satisfactory specimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;, section on 'Nondiagnostic (Bethesda I)'</a>.)</p><p>Evidence suggests the rates of nondiagnostic or unsatisfactory biopsies are reduced when specifically dedicated venues are employed for the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Rapid, on-site microscopic evaluation of the aspirate minimizes unsatisfactory samples, thereby improving the quality and safety of patient care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytological, immunocytological, and biochemical diagnosis of lymphadenopathy is facilitated by ultrasound-guided aspiration biopsy, in particular when the nodes are not palpable or are close to the jugular vein or carotid artery. Combined cytological and biochemical analysis of enlarged cervical lymph nodes can differentiate accurately between thyroid cancer metastases and inflammatory lymphadenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The presence of high levels of thyroglobulin in needle washings of aspirates of lymph nodes is presumptive evidence of metastatic thyroid cancer despite negative cytology, and serum anti-thyroglobulin antibodies do not adversely affect tissue thyroglobulin measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-role-of-serum-thyroglobulin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Role of serum thyroglobulin&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent thyroid cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When nodules in the thyroid bed or lymphadenopathy are of adequate size, ultrasound-guided biopsy can usually identify recurrent thyroid cancer correctly. In one retrospective study of 37 treated thyroid cancer patients, ultrasound-guided FNA produced 29 true-positives, six true-negatives, one false-negative, and one inadequate biopsy, with a sensitivity of 96.7 percent, a specificity of 100 percent, and an overall accuracy of 97.2 percent in detecting return of tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. One potential diagnostic pitfall of biopsy may be cytological misdiagnosis. Examples include identifying normal residual thyroid or parathyroid gland as recurrent tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. When assessing the postoperative thyroid bed, careful attention to cytological details and the use of selected immunohistochemical staining may help to prevent these errors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-cytological examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to cytology, ultrasound-guided tissue sampling can provide cells for biochemical analysis like calcitonin in medullary cancer, tumor markers such as Galectin-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] in papillary thyroid cancer, and chromosomal and genetic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Molecular analysis is particularly useful in the correct diagnosis of aspirates that show follicular neoplasm or follicular <span class=\"nowrap\">lesion/atypia</span> of undetermined significance (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-thyroid-nodules-with-indeterminate-cytology#H3088942949\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology&quot;, section on 'Molecular markers'</a>). Furthermore, ultrasound-guided tissue sampling can lead to a non-neoplastic diagnosis such as tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] or amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>As mentioned above, biochemical analysis of aspirated fluid or needle washings may reveal thyroglobulin when a lymph node is involved with thyroid cancer, even when cancer cells are not detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/23,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,31</a>]. It is noteworthy that any thyroid cells in an aspirate from a lymph node, even if the cells look benign, are presumptive evidence of thyroid cancer metastases because thyroid cells do not typically belong in a lymph node. Furthermore, a nonthyroid diagnosis, such as a parathyroid cyst, is possible when cyst fluid that is as clear and colorless as water is aspirated. Biochemical assay of the fluid will demonstrate a high concentration of intact parathyroid hormone (PTH).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Samples of thyroid tissue may be obtained percutaneously with a narrow-gauge needle, such as 25- or 27-gauge, to obtain cells for cytological analysis, or rarely, with a cutting needle to obtain a core of tissue for histopathological study. It should be noted, however, that there may be more complications when a core specimen is obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has largely replaced core needle biopsies at most centers. The fine-needle technique is popular because it is low risk, and cytology provides diagnostic information about nuclear and cytoplasmic detail that is not available with a core biopsy. Some clinicians prefer to do cutting needle biopsies, which provide only a single core of tissue for histopathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, the capsule of the nodule and vascular involvement is inadequately assessed. Core biopsy is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-biopsy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid biopsy&quot;, section on 'Other techniques'</a>.)</p><p>The technique for ultrasound-guided fine-needle thyroid biopsy involves three steps: puncture of the nodule or goiter, obtaining the sample, and preparation of the slides.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Puncturing the nodule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The simplest and most frequently used, but not the most accurate, method for ultrasound-assisted tissue sampling for palpable nodules is to locate the lesion on the film or screen, taking note of the location of solid or cystic components of the nodule in relation to palpable or visual landmarks. The operator then punctures the proper site to sample solid tissue. This approach to biopsy often does not yield diagnostic material when there is an extensive cystic, degenerated space within a nodule.</p><p>If this simple approach is not possible, has not been successful, or the specimen is too bloody for interpretation, real-time ultrasonography may be used to observe the insertion of a needle free hand or using a special needle guide attached to the transducer. The free-hand technique offers greater flexibility. With the free-hand method, the needle is inserted into the skin at a distance from the transducer, aiming at the palpated nodule. For nonpalpable nodules we use a blunt 1 mm dowel to produce a dimple in the skin over the nodule that was identified by the sonogram. We prefer this technique rather than using a permanent marker to establish a point for entry, as described in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The needle trajectory can either be parallel to or at an angle to the ultrasound beam. The parallel approach is technically challenging and special attention must be paid to sterility, but it has the advantage that the image of the needle shaft may be viewed as it traverses the neck into the nodule. The needle path is observed on the screen in more than one plane, while the operator maneuvers the needle to puncture the nodule. Many experienced operators prefer the simplicity, speed, and lack of complications that result when the needle is inserted oblique or perpendicular to the ultrasound beam. In this case, the needle tip is seen when it crosses the plane of the ultrasound as a very bright spot. With either method, the position of the needle tip within the nodule must be verified at the instant of sampling. It is essential when interpreting negative results to be mindful that it is difficult to be certain that the tip of the needle actually was within the nodule at the instant of sampling, especially for nodules less than 10 mm in diameter.</p><p>Transducers fitted with a needle guide are preferred by some clinicians, but they are cumbersome and require considerable practice and hand-eye coordination, unless a dedicated sonographer is assisting with the procedure.</p><p>Doppler ultrasound can be used to identify and avoid puncturing blood vessels that are encountered in the process of biopsy, thereby improving the specimen and cytological interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This feature is a distinct advantage over palpation-guided biopsy.</p><p>As noted above, it is important to avoid a bloody specimen because of the potential dangers of hemorrhage and because blood may obscure the cytology and may result in a nondiagnostic aspirate. There are limited data on the safety of thyroid FNA in patients on systemic anticoagulation. Medications that can be safely discontinued (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>) should be stopped five to seven days before the FNA procedure. The risk of stopping systemic anticoagulation before an FNA procedure must be weighed against the risk of complications related to clotting and thrombosis. For patients who have a high risk nodule and who cannot safely discontinue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, FNA of nodules using a 27-gauge needle and a minimum number of passes may be performed, with compression for 5 to 10 minutes following the procedure. Caution must be exercised not to compress the carotid artery. Some clinicians repeat the sonogram 15 to 30 minutes after the procedure to assure hemostasis and absence of hematoma. There have been reports that not discontinuing direct oral anticoagulants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>) before FNA is safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-biopsy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid biopsy&quot;, section on 'Procedure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue sampling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sample of tissue may be obtained in either of two ways. Many operators aspirate (FNA) the material with a syringe and exercise a to-and-fro motion to produce a large quantity. These maneuvers frequently yield excessive blood, dilute thyroid cells, and complicate cytologic examination. This technique should be reserved for low-yield or fibrotic lesions. The preferred mode involves a nonaspiration method for most nodules and goiters. Minimal trauma, tissue pressure, and capillary action (fine-needle capillary sampling [FNC]) are employed to achieve a small, concentrated sample that remains in the needle shaft. The specimen is then quickly but gently expelled onto a microscope slide with an air-filled syringe and suitably spread. FNC is easier and faster to perform than FNA and has been reported to result in comparable diagnostic cytologic adequacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Diff-Quik and Ultrafast Papanicolaou stains are the most commonly used preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Air dried Diff-Quik stained smears are frequently used for on-site evaluation of the aspirated material. Background colloid is easily identified with the Diff-Quik stain. Papanicolaou stain is applied after fixing the smears in alcohol. This stain is better for identifying cellular details such as nuclear features. Most cytopathology labs use a combination of staining techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2059585461\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
