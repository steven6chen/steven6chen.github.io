Limited evidence exists regarding the recommended height of the bite wound relative to the level of the heart. Expert recommendations vary according to the expected degree of local injury compared to systemic toxicity. In regions where venomous snakebites result in significant local tissue damage with important but less common systemic effects (eg, North America), the bite wound may be placed at the level of the heart to manage local swelling but not encourage systemic absorption. However, in settings where neurotoxicity is likely and local tissue effects are of secondary concern (eg, Australia), the bite wound should be kept below the level of the heart to slow lymphatic venom absorption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fashion a splint out of any rigid object (eg, padded piece of wood or tree branch, rolled newspaper, sleeping bag pad, or backpack frame) and apply to the extremity as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Splint the leg posteriorly in extension immobilizing the ankle and the knee.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Splint the arm to the elbow and apply a sling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transport the patient to the nearest medical facility as quickly as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do <strong>not</strong> allow the victim to walk because exertion and, with bite wounds on the lower extremity, local muscle contraction may increase snake venom absorption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do <strong>not</strong> manipulate the wound except to permit gentle bandaging or, if indicated, pressure immobilization or placement of a pressure pad. If transport to definitive care will take a prolonged period of time and a venom detection kit will <strong>not</strong> be used (countries other than Australia and Papua New Guinea), then gentle cleansing can be performed.

This situation may occur if pressure immobilization is improperly applied or local swelling has increased the tightness of the bandage. If time to definitive care will exceed the likely ability of the distal limb to survive prolonged anoxia, the bandage should be carefully loosened to permit distal circulation but to avoid systemic venom absorption.</p><p/><p>The pressure bandage and immobilization technique has wide support in Australia, where elapid snake toxins primarily cause neurotoxicity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> coagulopathy without tissue necrosis and where there may be significant delays in transfer to medical facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].</p><p>Its potential efficacy was first demonstrated in studies on monkeys using tiger snake venom (<em>Notechis scutatus</em>) with high systemic toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Immobilization of the envenomed limb and application of pressure of approximately 55 mmHg resulted in a significant delay in systemic absorption of venom. Dramatic benefits have also been described with delays of up to six hours for systemic absorption of venom in human case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, definitive evidence that pressure immobilization improves the outcomes of snakebites in humans is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].</p><p>Proper technique is a major consideration when assessing the potential benefit of pressure bandage and immobilization. Case series indicate that only 30 to 70 percent of patients treated for snakebite in Australia have pressure bandage and immobilization applied despite heavy emphasis on its use in this region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In addition, studies that evaluated intensive training of lay volunteers and healthcare providers indicate that proper bandage pressures are only achieved about 25 to 50 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, when used correctly for bites by snake species that do not cause local tissue damage, pressure immobilization is unlikely to be harmful and may be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10688188\"><span class=\"h2\">Methods to avoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following methods, while used widely in the past and advocated by some, cause more harm than good and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/3,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incision and oral suction </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical suction devices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electric shock therapy </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tourniquets </p><p/><p>For example, a common misconception is that one should apply a tourniquet, suck out the poison, and spit it out.

Furthermore, venom removal by suction is minimal.

(See <a href=\"#H10690537\" class=\"local\">'Additional resources'</a> below.)</p><p>Important considerations include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with unknown snakebites in regions with neurotoxic snake species may warrant prolonged observation (up to 24 hours post-bite).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Snake venoms that cause isolated coagulopathy will usually do so within 12 hours after envenomation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In locations where snakebite can cause systemic myolysis, observation up to 24 hours and pre-discharge measurement of creatine kinase may be warranted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, it is wise to observe suspected snakebite patients overnight, rather than discharge them in the evening or at night, as local resources allow.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10689586\"><span class=\"h2\">Antivenom</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite limited evidence and no placebo controlled trials of antivenom for most snake species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], antivenom remains the primary treatment for any patient with serious snake envenomation and, in most patients should be used whenever available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73959 \">table 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Although high rates of adverse reactions occur for some antivenoms, such patients generally benefit from antivenom and, for many, antivenom is life-saving. All patients who receive antivenom warrant appropriate measures to manage an adverse reaction. (See <a href=\"#H10689598\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10689729\" class=\"local\">'Allergic reactions'</a> below.)</p><p>Antivenoms consist of animal immunoglobulins developed against whole venom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The process involves immunizing animals (commonly horse, sheep, goats, or rabbits) with the venom and extracting the antivenom from the animal serum. Alternatively, IgY (immunoglobulin present in birds, reptiles, and amphibians but <strong>not</strong> mammals) may be raised against snake venoms using chicken eggs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, there are concerns that IgY-based antivenoms may contain antibodies against only some classes of toxins and therefore may not offer the broad spectrum neutralization offered by IgG-based antivenoms. Antivenoms may be provided as whole immunoglobulin (IgG or IgY) or as Fab fragments; either F(ab)<sub>2 </sub>or Fab fragments.</p><p>Antivenoms vary with respect to the number of venoms against which they are raised as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monovalent</strong> &ndash; Most monovalent antivenoms are raised against a single genus or species of snake and are only effective for bites by that snake or group of snakes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A few &quot;monovalent&quot; antivenoms (eg, all the Australian &quot;monovalent&quot; snake antivenoms) are actually made from polyvalently immunized animals and may contain activity against non-listed species of snakes. However, the extent of this activity is variable and not certified by the producer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Polyvalent</strong> &ndash; Polyvalent antivenoms are developed against venoms from multiple different snakes that typically share a geographical region and can be used to treat envenomations by any of the included species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10689598\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When deciding whether to administer antivenom, clinicians who are unfamiliar with the management of snakebite should seek expert consultation with a clinical toxinologist, poison control center, or physician experienced in management of snakebites in the region.

There is no clear &ldquo;rule&rdquo; that monovalent is better than polyvalent, but where the snake identity is established and the monovalent is of lower volume and risk (and potentially of lower cost), then clearly it is preferable, compared to polyvalent antivenom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, if an appropriate monovalent antivenom is either not available in a timely manner, or the quantity available is suboptimal, a relevant polyvalent antivenom should be used in addition, or instead. (See <a href=\"#H10689586\" class=\"local\">'Antivenom'</a> above.)</p><p>Effectiveness of antivenom may be reduced by clinical factors (eg, late presentation), a mismatch between envenoming species and the antivenom administered (eg, misdiagnosis), pharmacokinetic factors (failure to reach target sites) and irreversible venom binding.

The decision to administer antivenom must balance the potential benefit with the risk of adverse reactions. However, where there is severe envenomation, and the available antivenom is associated with relatively low rates of anaphylaxis, the optimal course of action is relatively straightforward.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients receiving antivenom require frequent monitoring and should have resuscitation equipment and medications to treat anaphylaxis, most importantly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (drawn up in a syringe or prepared for continuous IV infusion) ready prior to commencing antivenom. Antivenom administration should occur in an acute care setting, (eg, emergency department or intensive care unit) whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H10689729\" class=\"local\">'Allergic reactions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Particularly for snakes with presynaptic neurotoxins (eg, kraits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93580\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93580 \">picture 1</a>), most Australian elapid snakes, mambas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93581\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93581 \">picture 2</a>), some coral snakes, South American rattlesnakes, some populations of Russell&rsquo;s vipers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93582\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93582 \">picture 3</a>), or some European adders), but also for some species with only postsynaptic neurotoxins, it is important to commence antivenom early, as soon as first signs become apparent (eg, ptosis or partial or lateral gaze ophthalmoplegia). (See <a href=\"#H10690483\" class=\"local\">'Neurotoxicity'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On the other hand, although delays in administration result in lowered effectiveness, anecdotal evidence suggests that some improvement is possible even days after envenomation with some snakes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although specific data varies by region, snake species, and available antivenom, the evidence to support the benefit of antivenom relies mainly on indirect epidemiological evidence of lower mortality worldwide after the introduction of antivenom against local venomous snake species, in vitro studies of venom neutralization, animal studies, and observational series in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/1,27,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,27,30-32</a>]. For example, the average death rate from snake envenomation in India has fallen from approximately 5.4 to 15.9 deaths per 100,000 persons in the 1940s to 1950s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] to an estimated 1.1 to 4.7 deaths per 100,000 more recently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/1,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,33</a>]. Furthermore, in 1914, prior to the availability of antivenom raised against indigenous species and wider availability of acute medical care facilities, the mortality among undifferentiated snakebite victims in India was approximately 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. By the 1980s, the lowest case fatality rate in this region was 1.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Given that many snakebite victims in India still do not have timely access to medical care and that most Indian antivenoms have high rates of allergic reactions (up to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]), this improvement in mortality is significant. However, in some regions of India, the death rate still remains as high as 9 percent with approximately 46,000 people dying from snakebites in India annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">More dramatic improvement in outcomes after the introduction of antivenom for snakebite has been seen in other countries. The following are selected examples with similar trends noted in other countries where data is available:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antivenom use in Nigeria after carpet viper bites (<em>Echis</em> species) resulted in no deaths among 400 patients as compared with a historical mortality of 10 to 20 percent among untreated <em>Echis</em> snakebite victims [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the United States, after the introduction of antivenom in the 1950s and the development of widespread availability of emergency and critical care medicine starting in the 1960s, mortality from snakebite dropped from as high as 36 percent to 0.06 percent.

The recommended approach to snakebite-induced rhabdomyolysis is extrapolated from crush injuries and is discussed in detail separately. Initial therapy consists of rapid infusion of isotonic saline to establish urine output of 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ml/kg</span> per hour in children). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury#H25398985\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;, section on 'Volume administration'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, patients with snake envenomation by Australian snake species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93456 \">table 4</a>) causing significant rhabdomyolysis (eg, creatine kinase [CK] &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L,</span> evidence of myoglobinuria, or kidney injury) without other systemic findings typically warrant antivenom. In such patients, the sooner antivenom is commenced, the more likely it will attenuate (but not reverse) rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Small observational studies suggest that antivenom may improve the clinical course of patients with myotoxicity after snakebite in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In a case series of 13 patients envenomated by the Mulga snake (<em>Pseudechis australis</em>), early antivenom administration less than three hours after the bite was associated with no myotoxicity in three patients compared with elevated CK (3000 to about 7000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L)</span> among seven patients who received antivenom after three hours. However, CK &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span> was also seen in three patients who did not receive antivenom.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evidence is lacking to guide the use of antivenom for snake species associated with isolated myotoxicity outside of Australia. Antivenom use in this situation should be guided by whether other forms of systemic envenomation (eg, neurotoxicity or coagulopathy) are present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Local effects only</strong> &mdash; Many snake species may cause medically significant or even severe local tissue damage around the bite site. The role of antivenom in reducing or preventing such tissue injury remains uncertain, but in general, antivenom is considered to have at least some beneficial effect in this setting. It is therefore necessary to weigh the benefits and risks of giving antivenom to treat purely local effects, on a case by case basis and consultation with a clinician with expertise managing snakebites in the region is advised. Potential candidates include patients with rapid development of obviously severe local effects (such as blistering, bruising, hemorrhagic blebs, necrosis), or rapid progression of effects (eg, over one to two hours) to involve a substantial part of the bitten limb. Such patients typically also have some evidence of systemic envenomation although findings may be nonspecific (eg, nausea, vomiting, or headache).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10689670\"><span class=\"h3\">Obtaining antivenom</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A listing of available antivenoms by region is available through the World Health Organization website (<a href=\"http://apps.who.int/bloodproducts/snakeantivenoms/database/&amp;token=7WsHzC/GhekHN/yMfX7bsnMnK6ThnOLxLKrgNxr+8tEWphn276jG0SdMXy6USARETETW8TTJElRIxmJEzuKjpQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=93182\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">WHO snake and antivenom database</a>) and at <a href=\"http://www.toxinology.com/&amp;token=EtRbW5/OyBAUI5muOBb+6N66tNHxGrnRQLEbdutudRbyW+hinlu+J38E2xcs36cp&amp;TOPIC_ID=93182\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.toxinology.com</a>.</p><p>Availability of antivenoms varies significantly by region. In general, appropriate antivenoms are more easily obtained in the Americas (North, Central, and South America), Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia than in sub-Saharan Africa and Papua New Guinea. Although there are good antivenoms available for Papua New Guinea, they are typically in short supply in hospitals there [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Often antivenom is available on a regional or national basis through the producer. However, clinicians in many regions with significant numbers of dangerous snake envenomations have little or no access to antivenom because of short supply, cost, or lack of antivenom available for the specific snake species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>For patients with envenomations by non-native exotic snakes, the clinician should contact the regional poison control center to determine if antivenom is available. Frequently, major zoos in North America and Europe stock a range of antivenoms for exotic snakes in their collections.

In small children, if IV access is not possible, intraosseous infusion is appropriate if life-threatening envenomation is likely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraosseous-infusion#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraosseous infusion&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinician may administer antivenom intravenously in one of two ways:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antivenom diluted in a compatible solution (eg, normal saline) and infused over 30 to 60 minutes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reconstituted and given by slow IV injection over 10 to 20 minutes </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Preliminary evidence suggests that the IV injection does not increase the risk of allergic reaction over IV infusion. As an example, in a trial of 198 patients receiving antivenom in Sri Lanka, the frequency of severe hypersensitivity reactions was not different in patients receiving IV injection over 20 minutes versus IV infusion over two hours (32 versus 35 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, IV infusion of diluted antivenom is still preferred because it permits slower administration with an ability to hold the infusion if an adverse reaction occurs and to restart the infusion at a slower rate after the reaction is treated. (See <a href=\"#H10689729\" class=\"local\">'Allergic reactions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, in some circumstances, such as under-resourced developing nation local health facilities, equipment for safe use of a diluted IV infusion may not be available, or of suspect quality and safety, and in this setting a slow IV push of antivenom by the physician may be a better option. However, the full dose of antivenom may be given before an adverse reaction is clinically apparent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The patient should be monitored carefully for signs of adverse reactions during and for at least one hour following antivenom administration, regardless of route. Resuscitation equipment and medications to treat anaphylaxis, most importantly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (drawn up in a syringe or prepared for continuous IV infusion) should be immediately available.

However, animal models indicate that the efficacy of IM antivenom may vary by snake species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-management/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

Development of proteinuria may also indicate possible emerging renal damage and is an indication of early acute kidney injury in Russell&rsquo;s viper (<em>Daboia russelii</em>) envenomation. Central pressure monitoring may be useful in titrating further fluid therapy. Short-term dialysis may be required. Rarely the renal damage may be permanent (usually bilateral renal cortical necrosis) requiring long term management for renal failure.

Key aspects include (see <a href=\"#H10688176\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Remove the patient from the snake's territory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Keep the patient calm and at rest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Remove any jewelry or footwear on the affected extremity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immobilize the injured body part. We suggest that patients with snakebites from species with venoms that cause paralysis with little to no local tissue damage (eg, Australian elapids, kraits, some purely neurotoxic cobras, coral snakes, or South American rattlesnakes) and for whom transportation to definitive medical treatment will be prolonged receive pressure bandage and immobilization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68766\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68766 \">figure 2</a>) rather than immobilization alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10688182\" class=\"local\">'Pressure immobilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergent management of respiratory depression and shock, followed by timely antivenom administration, if available, to patients with appropriate indications comprise the key initial interventions in patients with snakebite (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73959 \">table 8</a>). If pressure immobilization is in place, then it should <strong>not</strong> be removed until initial assessment, stabilization, and, if needed, antivenom are provided. Additional management depends upon whether the biting snake is known or unknown and whether envenomation has occurred. (See <a href=\"#H10688891\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When deciding whether to administer antivenom, clinicians who are unfamiliar with the management of snakebite should seek expert consultation with a clinical toxinologist, poison control center, or physician experienced in management of snakebites in the region. We recommend that patients with confirmed snakebite and evidence of life-threatening systemic envenomation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73959 \">table 8</a>) (eg, collapse, convulsions, weakness, paralysis, respiratory failure, shock, or bleeding) receive antivenom, if available, rather than supportive care alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Whenever possible, the snake should be identified clinically, by examination, or in Australia and Papua New Guinea, by venom kit testing. In certain regions, diagnostic algorithms can help with choosing the proper antivenom (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93179\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93179 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93454 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93456 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93180%7EEM%2F93181\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93180 graphicRef93181 \">algorithm 3A-B</a>).

Dosing is determined by the snake species and individual patient characteristics. It does <strong>not</strong> differ between adults and children. A list of available antivenoms by snake species can be found at the World Health Organization website (<a href=\"http://apps.who.int/bloodproducts/snakeantivenoms/database/&amp;token=7WsHzC/GhekHN/yMfX7bsnMnK6ThnOLxLKrgNxr+8tEWphn276jG0SdMXy6USARETETW8TTJElRIxmJEzuKjpQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=93182\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">WHO snake and antivenom database</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.toxinology.com/&amp;token=EtRbW5/OyBAUI5muOBb+6N66tNHxGrnRQLEbdutudRbyW+hinlu+J38E2xcs36cp&amp;TOPIC_ID=93182\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.toxinology.com</a>.

We suggest that patients treated with antivenom with a high rate of acute allergic reactions or who are receiving antivenom in facilities where the acute management of allergic reactions is problematic because of limited staffing or facilities receive premedication with subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

However, antivenom should be used with greater restraint and special caution in patients with a prior allergic reaction to antivenom or one of its components, asthma, or beta adrenergic blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor as current medications.

(See <a href=\"#H10690471\" class=\"local\">'Treatment other than antivenom'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that, when antivenom is not available or not effective for weakness or paralysis secondary to envenomation by a snake capable of causing postsynaptic neurotoxicity, patients undergo Tensilon (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a>) testing or a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a> trial to determine if anticholinesterase therapy may be beneficial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2374909\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Snakebites worldwide: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Trial of anticholinesterase (neostigmine or edrophonium)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with neurotoxic snakebite for whom antivenom is not available or is ineffective and who have a positive Tensilon (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a>) test or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a> trial, we recommend treatment with an anticholinesterase (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Neostigmine is the anticholinesterase that has primarily been used in snakebite victims.
