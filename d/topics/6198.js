Most cases of cadmium toxicity are due to chronic exposure. Chronic, low-level cadmium exposure can affect a variety of organs, with the kidneys and bones being the principal targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Acute cadmium toxicity is less common. Depending upon the route of exposure, acute cadmium toxicity primarily affects the lungs and gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>This topic reviews chronic and acute cadmium toxicity. Other heavy metal toxicities are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mercury-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mercury toxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lead nephropathy and lead-related nephrotoxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arsenic exposure and poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9035802\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC HUMAN EXPOSURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9035932\"><span class=\"h2\">Source of exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cadmium is a relatively rare heavy metal that occurs naturally in combination with zinc. Environmental contamination and consequent human exposure to cadmium have dramatically increased during the past 100 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Cadmium commonly contaminates the environment via cadmium-containing material in household waste, industrial emissions, and soil. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cadmium-containing products are frequently thrown out with the household garbage; the metal is then released into the atmosphere if the waste is burned.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cadmium emissions are released from mining and nonferrous smelters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soil is commonly contaminated via atmospheric emissions and sewage sludge. Land used for farming can also contain cadmium due to the use of phosphate fertilizers containing the metal. Cadmium is readily absorbed by plants grown in cadmium-containing soil, particularly grain, rice, and vegetables.</p><p/><p>Exposure to cadmium principally results from eating contaminated food, smoking cigarettes, and working in cadmium-contaminated work places.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9036082\"><span class=\"h3\">Food intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The daily intake of cadmium through food varies in part by geographic region. As an example, intake is reported to be approximately 8 to 30 mcg in Europe and the United States versus 59 to 113 mcg in various areas of Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There is also a wide individual variation in cadmium intake based upon the type and amount of food consumed. Since this variation follows a log-normal distribution, most individuals ingest between 4 and 60 mcg per day (eg, &plusmn;2 standard deviations [SDs]) if the average individual intake is 15 mcg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The average gastrointestinal absorption is 5 percent. Thus, the net absorbed amount of cadmium is approximately 1 to 2 mcg per day in Europe and the United States and up to 5 mcg in areas in Japan. In certain areas of Japan, such as the Jinzu river basin and Kakehashi river basin, which are considered highly contaminated with cadmium, the net ingestion is likely higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The gastrointestinal absorption of dietary cadmium is increased by mild iron deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As a result, chronically iron-deficient individuals are at higher risk for environmental cadmium exposure. (See <a href=\"#H9034591\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9036096\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking is a potentially important route of cadmium exposure. Individuals who smoke 20 cigarettes a day absorb through the lungs nearly 1 mcg of cadmium, an amount similar to the quantity absorbed via food in Europe and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9036102\"><span class=\"h3\">Occupational exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The workplace constitutes the most important source of cadmium exposure among individuals engaged in cadmium production and the industrial use of cadmium. Major industrial applications for cadmium are in the production of alloys, galvanizing pigments, and nickel-cadmium batteries. Over one million individuals worldwide are believed to be occupationally exposed to cadmium.</p><p>The permissible occupational threshold limit values range from 0.005 to 0.05 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">Cd/m<sup>3</sup></span> in air in various countries. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set the permissible exposure limit for cadmium in air to 0.005 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">Cd/m<sup>3</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9036155\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolism after exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal absorption following oral intake is relatively poor, with the highest estimates for bioavailability listed at approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Inhalational absorption is far more efficient, with up to 25 percent of inhaled cadmium absorbed. However, total absorbed dose is also dependent on inhaled particle size. Small particles (&lt;0.1 micrometer) are more likely to penetrate to the alveoli, where cadmium absorption occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. After ingestion of contaminated food or inhalation via cigarette smoking or at the workplace, cadmium is transported to the liver, where metallothionein, a cadmium- and zinc-binding protein, is synthesized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Metallothionein serves as a detoxifying protein by binding cadmium and preventing free cadmium ions from disturbing normal cellular functions. It is also responsible for the pronounced accumulation of cadmium in the liver and kidneys.</p><p>Metallothionein, which has a molecular weight of approximately 7000, migrates slowly from the liver cells into the blood stream, where it is transported to the kidneys. As with other small proteins, it is freely filtered across the glomerulus and then reabsorbed by the proximal tubular cells via pinocytosis. In the tubular cells, metallothionein enters the lysosomes, where it is degraded by lysozymes, releasing free cadmium ions into the tubular cell cytoplasm.</p><p>The renal tubular cells have a considerable capacity to synthesize metallothionein, which binds the toxic cadmium ions. At some point, however, the kidneys' detoxifying capacity is surpassed, and free cadmium causes tubular damage, interstitial inflammation, and eventually fibrosis and glomerular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9033914\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease associations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic cadmium exposure causes toxicity of the kidney and bones. Chronic exposure may also be associated with lung cancer and emphysema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with cadmium-associated renal disease have isolated tubular defects that are only detected by specific testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Early manifestations include an increased excretion of low-molecular-weight proteins, such as beta2-microglobulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In almost all cases, tubular proteinuria is irreversible, even if exposure has ceased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>Some workers exposed to cadmium have a slightly increased urinary excretion of albumin, which may be related to a glomerular lesion or represent decreased tubular reabsorption of the small amount of albumin that is normally filtered through the glomerulus.</p><p>In more severe cases of cadmium toxicity, patients present with evidence of kidney interstitial injury, including the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/1,11,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,19,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal glucosuria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aminoaciduria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal phosphate wasting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercalciuria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyuria due to decreased concentration capacity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished ability to handle an acid (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) load</p><p/><p>Despite tubular damage, kidney disease does not appear to progress in most individuals. In a five-year follow-up study of nearly 600 Belgian individuals with initially mild evidence of tubular damage and decreasing exposure to cadmium, there was no evidence of progressive renal damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Thus, patients with isolated tubular defects rarely have symptoms or clinically evident disease. However, there are several exceptions to this:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some individuals develop kidney stones as a result of hypercalciuria, which is a known risk factor for stones (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Hypercalciuria'</a>). The prevalence of symptomatic kidney stones is increased among individuals occupationally exposed to cadmium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/1,11,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,22</a>]. In one report, for example, a dose-response relationship was demonstrated between cumulative cadmium exposure among a group of battery workers and the age-adjusted cumulative incidence of renal calculi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74139\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74139 \">figure 1</a>). Hypercalciuria is thought to be a primary determinant of stone formation in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some individuals, presumably those with more severe exposure to cadmium, present with a decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/11,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,25-27</a>]. There is an association among the degree of tubular dysfunction, the cadmium dose, and a decrease in GFR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74549\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74549 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some individuals who have significant environmental cadmium exposure progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). As an example, uremia was a common cause of death among Japanese farmers suffering from cadmium-induced osteomalacia (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Bone disease'</a> below) and has been observed in workers previously heavily exposed to cadmium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Additionally, in a large cohort study from a cadmium-polluted area of Sweden, the age-standardized incidence rate ratio (SRR) of requiring renal replacement therapy over an 18-year period was higher among those with increased exposure to cadmium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The SRR among those with low, moderate, and high cadmium exposure was 1.4, 1.9, and 2.3, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9034591\"><span class=\"h4\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to cadmium exposure, risk factors for cadmium-induced nephrotoxicity include, age, diabetes mellitus, and iron deficiency.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cadmium exposure &ndash;</strong> Cadmium exposure is required for cadmium-induced nephrotoxicity. Multiple epidemiologic studies have associated endemic outbreaks of cadmium-induced kidney disease in Japan with consumption of cadmium-contaminated rice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/1,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,11</a>]. Other studies from certain areas of Belgium, China, Japan, and Sweden demonstrated an association between high body cadmium burdens and kidney dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/9,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,28-30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The degree of cadmium exposure that is toxic is not known. Chronic exposure of the kidney to cadmium is reflected in the urinary cadmium excretion. The threshold urinary cadmium excretion that is associated with toxicity is not known and is probably higher than was previously described.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Based upon cross-sectional studies of occupationally exposed workers, it was previously suggested that 10 mcg <span class=\"nowrap\">Cd/g</span> creatinine (equal to 10 nmol <span class=\"nowrap\">Cd/mmol</span> creatinine) would be a safe level below which kidney dysfunction would rarely develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A urinary cadmium concentration of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> creatinine roughly corresponds to a kidney cortex concentration of 200 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">Cd/kg,</span> a level long considered to be the &quot;critical level&quot; above which kidney damage may first be seen. Realizing the variation in individual susceptibility to cadmium, a 1992 document from the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that renal tubular proteinuria would develop in approximately 10 and 50 percent of individuals with kidney cortex cadmium concentrations of 200 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subsequent reports, however, indicate that toxicity may occur at much lower urinary cadmium concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/5,7,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,30</a>]. A number of studies have suggested that increased secretion of tubular proteins may occur at urine cadmium concentrations exceeding a level of only 1 to 5 mcg <span class=\"nowrap\">Cd/g</span> creatinine (or 2 to 3 nmol <span class=\"nowrap\">Cd/mmol</span> creatinine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/28,30,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,32,33</a>]. In one study, depending upon age, the prevalence of beta2-microglobulinuria was 5 to 15 percent at urinary cadmium concentrations of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/mmol</span> creatinine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74549\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74549 \">figure 2</a>). Among 820 environmentally exposed postmenopausal women (aged 53 to 64 years), cadmium levels in blood and urine were associated with reduced eGFR and increased markers of tubular injury; these associations were seen at a mean urinary cadmium level as low as 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/mmol</span> creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, associations between eGFR and cadmium were only recorded when smokers were included in the multiple regression analysis, which suggests that confounding from smoking may be a problem in the interpretation of the findings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Even lower urinary cadmium concentrations have been associated with proteinuria in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, these associations appear to be largely driven by current smoking, variations in diuresis, and probably also the co-excretion in urine of Cd with proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The assessment of data of a large cohort of nickel-cadmium battery workers revealed that the renal effects of chronic smoking substantially distort the dose <span class=\"nowrap\">effect/response</span> relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. On the basis of associations undistorted by smoking and adjusted for covariates, the threshold for low-molecular-weight proteinuria induced by occupational exposure to Cd was estimated between 5.5 and 6.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/mmol</span> creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A review of the literature combined with an analysis of the risks from environmental cadmium exposure concluded that there is an extremely low margin of safety between current levels of exposure to cadmium and that which may cause renal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. If the average daily intake of cadmium is increased from 15 to 30 mcg, approximately 1 percent of the adult population would be expected to develop renal tubular damage (as detected by tubular proteinuria). In certain high-risk groups, such as women with poor iron stores, the percentage affected would be even higher.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age &ndash;</strong> Older individuals are more likely to suffer from renal toxicity at a given level of cadmium exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In an examination of Swedish battery workers, a 10 percent prevalence of tubular proteinuria associated with a cadmium level of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/mmol</span> creatinine was found in the older age group versus 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/mmol</span> creatinine in the younger subjects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74549\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74549 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A number of possible reasons have been advanced as to why older individuals have a higher prevalence of renal dysfunction when exposed to cadmium. Older individuals may have an increased cadmium body burden with age due to higher amounts of cadmium accumulated in the kidney from both occupational exposure and environmental sources (food, tobacco). Degenerative changes in the renal tubules with age may predispose to cadmium-induced tubular injury and accelerate the rate of cadmium-induced renal dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diabetes &ndash;</strong> Studies from Belgium suggest that individuals with diabetes mellitus also have a higher risk to develop kidney dysfunction from cadmium exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Iron deficiency</strong> &ndash; Individuals with iron deficiency may be at higher risk for cadmium toxicity. This is because iron deficiency results in higher gastrointestinal cadmium absorption.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cadmium toxicity is associated with bone disease. Bone disease due to prolonged exposure to cadmium was first reported among exposed individuals living in the Jinzu river basin in Japan, an area that is highly contaminated with cadmium. Exposure to cadmium was caused by the use of contaminated river water for irrigation of rice fields. Cadmium toxicity resulted in Itai-Itai (&quot;Ouch-Ouch&quot;) disease, an illness characterized by multiple fractures, a mixed pattern of osteoporosis and osteomalacia, and kidney damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/1,11,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,38,39</a>]. The diagnosis of osteomalacia was made by clinical manifestations including multiple fractures, vertebral compressions, shortening of stature, and other radiograph and autopsy findings. Bone biopsies were generally not performed. A few additional reports have described similar bone disorders in workers with kidney damage and a history of heavy exposure to cadmium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>].</p><p>A dose-dependent association of cadmium exposure with osteoporosis and bone fractures was subsequently described in numerous observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/2,3,40-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,40-49</a>]. These studies, which included individuals who had lower-intensity cadmium exposure than those in the original case series, ascertained cadmium exposure using blood <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urine levels or an estimation of dietary intake.</p><p>The following examples illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort of 506 individuals living in proximity to zinc smelters in Belgium underwent baseline measurement of urinary cadmium excretion with assessments of forearm bone mineral density and fracture incidence a mean of 6.6 years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Urinary cadmium excretion was inversely correlated with future bone mineral density.

Among those aged &ge;60 years, blood cadmium was independently and inversely correlated with bone mineral density in women. In both men and women &ge;60 years, a blood cadmium of &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> was associated with a threefold higher prevalence of osteoporosis (defined as a z-score &lt;-1) compared with those who had a blood cadmium &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another cross-sectional study of 2688 women examined the association of the urine cadmium-to-creatinine ratio with bone mineral density and the prevalence of fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. After controlling for potential confounders, a higher urine cadmium-to-creatinine ratio was significantly and inversely correlated with bone mineral density and positively associated with the prevalence of osteoporosis. This relationship was stronger in women who had never smoked compared with women who smoked. In addition, the prevalence of fractures was twofold higher in nonsmoking women whose cadmium-to-creatinine ratio was &gt;0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> compared with nonsmoking women whose ratio was &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span>.

Lung cancer incidence among 521 individuals residing in a cadmium-contaminated zinc smelter area was compared with that in 473 individuals with low environmental exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. During a median follow-up of 17 years, 3 and 16 lung cancers occurred in the low- and high-exposure areas, respectively, for an incidence of 0.4 versus 1.8 per 1000 patient-years at risk, respectively. In multivariate analyses adjusted for smoking, age, and gender, the hazard ratio was 4.2 (95% CI 1.2-14) for high- versus low-exposure areas, respectively, and 1.7 (95% CI 1.1-2.6) for doubling of 24-hour urinary cadmium excretion. However, concomitant exposure to arsenic, a well-known human carcinogen, occurred in the exposed area. This was adjusted for in the epidemiologic analyses, but the possibility for residual confounding from arsenic, or some other contaminant in the zinc smelter area, cannot be ruled out completely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Continued inhalative exposure to cadmium can give rise to obstructive lung disease and emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H614936488\"><span class=\"h4\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with chronic cadmium toxicity are asymptomatic for kidney disease, although they may have symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a previously established diagnosis of osteoporosis.

However, mild increases in protein excretion (ie, &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> may be detected by protein quantitation of a 24-hour urine collection or by protein-to-creatinine ratio in a spot urine. As noted above, occasional patients with cadmium toxicity may have increased albumin excretion, which is detectable by urine dipstick; however, this is uncommon.</p><p>Some patients present with symptoms of a concentrating defect with complaints of nocturia or polyuria.

Cadmium in urine reflects the cumulative cadmium exposure. The urine cadmium should be adjusted for dilution by calculating the <span class=\"nowrap\">cadmium/creatinine</span> ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/7,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,58</a>]. There is no absolute <span class=\"nowrap\">cadmium/creatinine</span> ratio that is considered diagnostic, but, in clear cases of cadmium nephrotoxicity, it is usually &gt;5 nmol <span class=\"nowrap\">Cd/mmol</span> creatinine. In the setting of a history of exposure to cadmium or clinical evidence of toxicity (such as a Fanconi syndrome and increased urinary excretion of beta2-microglobulin), abnormally increased blood cadmium concentration and urinary <span class=\"nowrap\">cadmium/ratio</span> should be considered evidence of chronic toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Increased excretion of at least one tubular protein should be demonstrated to confirm the diagnosis of cadmium nephrotoxicity. Several highly sensitive indicators of tubular damage have been developed and used in cross-sectional and epidemiologic studies in cadmium-exposed groups. We first measure the urinary excretion of beta2-microglobulin. Among patients who have increased blood and urinary cadmium concentrations, an increase in beta2-microglobulin excretion &gt;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> creatinine is considered diagnostic. Beta2-microglobulin is a low-molecular plasma protein with a molecular weight of 12,000 and is easily detected using radioimmunoassays. Beta microglobulin is freely filtered by the glomerulus and almost completely (&gt;99.9 percent) reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Even small changes in tubular reabsorptive capacity result in a marked increase in urinary beta2-microglobulin excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The United States OSHA requires that an employer take action if a cadmium-exposed worker demonstrates a urinary beta microglobulin concentration exceeding 750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> creatinine, though nonmandatory levels for removal from work exposure are advised for concentrations between 300 and 750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> creatinine. A table outlining OSHA recommendations in response to elevated surveillance levels for blood or urine cadmium, or beta2-microglobulin excretion, is available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F107690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107690 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>However, measurement of beta2-microglobulin is less sensitive for diagnosis among patients who have acidic urine since the protein degrades in an acid pH. Thus, among patients who have acidic urine (pH &lt;5.6) and do not have or have only a mild increase in urinary beta2-microglobulin, we measure either retinol binding protein, human complex-forming glycoprotein (protein HC or alpha-1-microglobulin), or apolipoprotein. These are equally sensitive but less widely used indicators of cadmium-induced tubular damage.</p><p>These plasma proteins are all filtered through the glomerulus. Other urinary markers indicative of a subtle tubulotoxic effect are increased excretion of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), an enzyme localized in lysosomes of the tubular cells, and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), a transmembrane protein expressed in proximal tubule cells after injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-toxicity-of-cadmium/abstract/32,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,60</a>].
