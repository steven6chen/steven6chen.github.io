Like other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), it inhibits cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin synthase), thereby impairing the ultimate transformation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66146\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66146 \">figure 1</a>).

Allergic reactions to NSAIDs range from rash, urticaria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema to life-threatening anaphylaxis. In contrast to pseudoallergic reactions, these reactions are elicited by a single NSAID, or rarely by more than one agent with similar molecular structures. Patients with allergic reactions to an NSAID have had at least one prior exposure to the culprit drug, which presumedly sensitizes them and results in symptoms upon repeat exposure to the same drug.

Some clinicians may choose <strong>not</strong> to give AC to children who are asymptomatic, have coingestants reliably excluded, and whose ingested dose is &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. The recommendation for AC administration following ibuprofen overdose derives from indirect evidence of benefit in volunteers, animal studies, and evidence of benefit following ingestions of other medications. Because of adverse effects, such as vomiting and dehydration, the combination of a cathartic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sorbitol</a>) and AC should be used sparingly, if at all, and only a single dose of a cathartic should be given to any patient.
