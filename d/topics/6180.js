Older studies that used only serologic testing found a low prevalence of <em>Legionella</em> (mean 0.8 percent) among patients with CAP who did not require hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In contrast, a prospective review of 2503 German adults with CAP seen from 2002 to 2005 found that <em>Legionella</em> spp were equally common among ambulatory and hospitalized patients (3.7 and 3.8 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A probable contributor to the increased rate of diagnosed <em>Legionella</em> infection in ambulatory patients is more complete testing (<em>Legionella</em> urinary antigen testing, and <em>Legionella</em> culture and polymerase chain reaction from sputum samples).

The number of cases reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tripled from 2000 to 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. While this increase may be due to improved diagnosis and reporting, environmental influences including flooding and increased rainfall have been suggested as the primary reason [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/20,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospital associated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospital-acquired Legionnaires' disease depends upon the presence of the organism in the potable water supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Surveys have shown that <em>Legionella</em> colonizes the hot water distribution system in 12 to 70 percent of hospitals in specific geographic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

This strain did not exhibit any clustering within the city but was not present in other parts of France, leading to the conclusion that it had spread throughout the city via the water distribution network.</p><p>In the past, the diagnosis of endemic Legionnaires' disease in the hospital setting was often missed because of the lack of availability of specialized laboratory tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/3,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,29,30</a>]. However, the <em>Legionella</em> urinary antigen assay has become more readily available, and the diagnosis of <em>Legionella</em> pneumonia has therefore increased. As an example, in the first prospective multicenter study of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) to use the <em>Legionella</em> urinary antigen assay, which was conducted at five hospitals over a 19-month period, <em>L. pneumophila</em> was diagnosed in 7 of 60 cases of HAP in non&ndash;intensive care unit (ICU) patients in which an etiology was found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term care facility associated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In long-term care facilities and nursing homes, <em>Legionella</em> spp are an important but under-recognized cause of pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>].

However, antibodies do not promote complement-mediated killing of <em>Legionella</em> nor do they inhibit intracellular proliferation of the organism. The role of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) against <em>Legionella </em>is unclear. The organism resists killing by PMNs even in the presence of specific antibody and complement. Neutropenia does not predispose to <em>Legionella</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193697763\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since the organism was first identified in 1976 during an outbreak at an American Legion Convention in Philadelphia, <em>Legionella</em> has been recognized as a relatively common cause of both community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Legionellosis refers to the two clinical syndromes caused by bacteria of the genus <em>Legionella</em>:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Legionnaires' disease is the more common syndrome of pneumonia caused by <em>Legionella</em> species.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pontiac fever is an acute, febrile, self-limited illness, which has been linked to <em>Legionella</em> species. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of Legionnaires' disease depends upon the degree of water reservoir contamination, the intensity of patient exposure to that water, and the susceptibility of the host. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The family Legionellaceae consists of 50 species and includes more than 70 serogroups. <em>L. pneumophila</em> is the most common species, which causes at least 80 percent of human infections; within this species, there are multiple serogroups, but serogroups 1, 4, and 6 are the ones most frequently implicated in human infection. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Legionella</em> species are aerobic, gram-negative bacilli that do not grow on routine bacteriologic media. Specialized media, usually buffered charcoal yeast extract media, are required for growth, which typically takes three to five days. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for <em>Legionella</em> pneumonia include cigarette smoking, chronic lung disease, increasing age, transplantation, and other forms of immunosuppression (eg, glucocorticoids, tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Host risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural habitats for <em>L. pneumophila</em> are aquatic bodies, including lakes and streams. Although these natural waters contain only a small number of <em>Legionella</em>, man-made reservoirs, such as water distribution systems, act as amplifiers for the growth and proliferation of the organism. Factors known to enhance colonization include warm temperatures (25 to 42&ordm;C), stagnation, and scale and sediment. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Environmental ecology and transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary host defense mechanism against <em>Legionella</em> is cell-mediated immunity similar to other intracellular pathogens. Depression of cell-mediated immunity by glucocorticoids and antirejection drugs used in transplantation predisposes the host to Legionnaires' disease.
