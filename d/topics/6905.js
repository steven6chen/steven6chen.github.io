Careful evaluation for underlying causes is important for these uncommon types of headache.</p><p>This topic will review exertional headache. Other types of uncommon primary headache disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-stabbing-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary stabbing headache&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-cough-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary cough headache&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary headache associated with sexual activity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypnic-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypnic headache&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with thunderclap headache&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nummular-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nummular headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92135061\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headache provoked by exercise may occur either as a symptom of another disorder (secondary or symptomatic exertional headache) or as a primary disorder without an identifiable underlying abnormality (primary exertional headache). The relative frequency of primary versus secondary headaches differs from one case series to another. However, as neuroimaging techniques have improved, the proportion of symptomatic headaches relative to primary headaches has increased.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case series from the 1960s, of 103 patients who presented with exertional (including cough-triggered) headache and a normal neurologic examination, an intracranial lesion developed in only 9.7 percent after three years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a literature review from the early 1990s, of 219 nonconsecutive patients with exertional headache that also included patients with cough headache, a structural lesion was found in 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series from the mid-1990s that included 28 consecutive patients with exertional headache, an intracranial abnormality was found in 12 (43 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The patients in this series with secondary headaches generally had symptoms strongly suggestive of an intracranial abnormality, including sudden explosive onset, vomiting, and focal neurologic deficits such as diplopia and papilledema.</p><p/><p>The underlying abnormalities most commonly associated with exertional headache include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous traumatic injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supratentorial and posterior fossa space-occupying lesions (both metastatic and primary)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular abnormalities such as cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracranial hemorrhage</p><p/><p>Other types of paroxysmal headache that may be triggered by exertion include pheochromocytoma-related headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and headache due to intermittent obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow caused by a third ventricular colloid cyst, lateral ventricular tumor, or Chiari type I malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, cardiogenic headache may be triggered by exertion in patients with risk factors for coronary disease, including those without chest pain or evidence of ischemia on ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Exercise is also a fairly common trigger in some migraineurs for their typical migrainous headaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92134936\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of exertional headache is not well understood. As with cough headache, most theories center on the transmission of increases in <span class=\"nowrap\">intra-abdominal/intrathoracic</span> pressure into the cranium via the venous system with distension of, or traction on, pain sensitive vascular or meningeal structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In some cases, it may share a common mechanism with migraine, since exertion is a trigger for migraine headaches in some individuals.</p><p>However, it is unclear why certain individuals become vulnerable to repeated activations of trigeminocervical nociceptive neurons, since similar transient increases in intracranial pressure due to Valsalva presumably occur in everyone. Possibilities include factors that cause lowered activation thresholds in first or second order nociceptive trigeminocervical neurons, alterations in central nociceptive processing, or factors that result in inordinately large fluctuations in intracranial pressure.</p><p>Another possibility is that incompetence of the internal jugular vein valve might play a role in the development of exertional headache by predisposing to increased cerebral venous congestion and elevated intracranial pressure during Valsalva maneuvers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In support of this notion, a study employing venous duplex ultrasound compared 20 patients with exertional headache and 40 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Retrograde jugular venous flow during Valsalva was significantly more frequent in patients with exertional headache than controls (70 versus 20 percent, respectively).</p><p>An alternative hypothesis suggested by transcranial Doppler studies is that exertional and sexual headache may be the result of impaired autoregulation of cerebrovascular smooth muscle. This dysregulation may impair the ability of resistance vessels to adequately respond to increased blood pressure during exercise, resulting in abnormal vasodilation, vessel wall edema, or increased cephalic blood volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exertional headache is characterized by episodes of pulsatile head pain that are brought on by or occur only during or after physical exercise.</p><p>Exertional headaches are bilateral and throbbing in quality. They persist from five minutes to 48 hours, are triggered by physical exercise, and may be prevented by avoidance of excessive physical exertion. Exertional headaches are not usually associated with nausea or vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], although patients who also have migraine may develop exertional headaches with migrainous features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It should be pointed out that the defining features of exertional headache come to us from a relatively small number of case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/1-3,8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,8,10,11</a>].</p><p>The precise incidence and prevalence of primary exertional headache are unknown, and estimates vary widely. A Danish population-based study of adults found that benign exertional headache had a lifetime prevalence of 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], while a study of adults from Norway found a prevalence of approximately 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. One large series carried out in athletes (cyclists) estimated a considerably higher prevalence of 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92134796\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of primary exertional headache, according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3), requires fulfilling all of the following criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least two headache episodes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brought on by and occurring only during or after strenuous physical exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lasting &lt;48 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Distinguishing cough headache and exertional headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because Valsalva maneuvers frequently occur in the context of many forms of physical exertion, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish primary cough headache from primary exertional headache. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-cough-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary cough headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, several clinical differences between benign cough and benign exertional headache have been identified that aid in distinguishing the two disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough headache is triggered by Valsalva maneuvers, while exertional headache is triggered by more sustained physical exercise</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average age of patients afflicted with benign cough headache is 67 (&plusmn; 11), while the average age of patients with benign exertional headache is 24 (&plusmn; 11)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary cough headache typically has a faster onset than benign exertional headache, which builds up over minutes or longer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary cough headaches are shorter in duration than benign exertional headaches</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary cough headaches are typically sharp and stabbing in quality while benign exertional headaches are described as pulsatile</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with exercise-induced headache should have neuroimaging, preferably with brain MRI, and a neurovascular evaluation with intracranial MRI and MRA to rule out vascular abnormalities or other structural causes. The need for such investigations increases when the headaches appear de novo after the age of 40, are prolonged beyond a few hours, or are accompanied by vomiting or focal neurologic symptoms.</p><p>Any symptoms suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), including rapid onset, alteration in consciousness, or meningeal symptoms, argue for emergent evaluation.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once other causes (eg, structural, cerebrovascular, and cardiovascular) of exertional headache have been eliminated, treatment should be started.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of exertional headaches is usually prophylactic or preemptive when exercise is predictable. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Indomethacin</a> is the de facto drug of choice for benign exertional headaches, although supporting evidence is mainly anecdotal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exertional-headache/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The therapeutic dose may range form 25 to 150 mg per day, although higher doses up to 250 mg may be necessary.
