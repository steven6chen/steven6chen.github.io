These include the Chiari 0 malformation, characterized by anatomic aberration of the brainstem (posterior pontine tilt, downward displacement of the medulla, low lying obex) but with normally placed cerebellar tonsils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and the Chiari 1.5 malformation, which is a CM-II like malformation without spina bifida [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Chiari malformations are often associated with spinal cord cavitations (ie, syringomyelia). In most cases of Chiari malformations, the posterior fossa is small, and neural elements are crowded and impacted at the foramen magnum.</p><p>With any of the Chiari types, other bony abnormalities may also be seen, including the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atlas assimilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atlantoaxial dislocation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Klippel-Feil anomaly (congenital anomaly consisting of failure of segmentation of any two of the seven cervical vertebrae)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platybasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basilar invagination (protrusion of the odontoid process through the foramen magnum into the intracranial cavity)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Luckenschadel, also known as lacunar skull (an ossification disorder in which the fetal skull appears fenestrated)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15846546\"><span class=\"h2\">Chiari type I</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chiari type I malformation (CM-I) is characterized by cerebellar tonsils that are abnormally shaped and downwardly displaced below the level of the foramen magnum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68681\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68681 \">image 1</a>). The normal cerebellar tonsils may lie up to 3 mm below the foramen magnum in adults. In general, tonsils lying 5 mm or more below the foramen magnum on neuroimaging are considered to be consistent with a Chiari malformation, though there is no direct correlation between how low the tonsils are lying and clinical severity. With infants, however, tonsils as low as 6 mm below the foramen magnum can still be normal. </p><p>The frequency of spinal cavitations (syringomyelia, hydromyelia or syringohydromyelia) with CM-I varies in the literature between 40 and 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Some patients even have a holocord syrinx that extends the whole length of the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Atlas assimilation, often associated with the Klippel-Feil anomaly, is common in CM-I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The Klippel-Feil anomaly may not be evident in infants and young children, as the fusion site might still be cartilaginous at an early age.</p><p>The prevalence of hydrocephalus associated with CM-I is approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15846561\"><span class=\"h2\">Chiari type II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Chiari II malformation (CM-II) is characterized by downward displacement of inferior cerebellar vermis (involving the nodulus, pyramis and uvula), and cerebellar tonsils and medulla through the foramen magnum into the upper cervical canal, in association with a myelomeningocele at the lumbosacral or occasionally a higher level of the spinal cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71208\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71208 \">image 2</a>). The malformation obstructs the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid through the posterior fossa, causing hydrocephalus. Almost all patients with a myelomeningocele have CM-II, and most have associated hydrocephalus. A reduced volume of the posterior fossa with an enlarged foramen magnum and low torcula with ventral displacement of the tentorium cerebelli are constant features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Additional findings that may be associated with CM-II include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61495 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61496\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61496 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inferior displacement of the fourth ventricle into the upper cervical canal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elongation and thinning of the lower pons and the medulla</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beaking of the quadrigeminal plate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kinking of medullary spinal cord junction in the cervical canal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stenosis or atresia of the cerebral aqueduct</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upward displacement of the upper cerebellum into the middle fossa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar dysplasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colpocephaly (abnormal enlargement) of the posterior lateral ventricles</p><p/><p>Infrequent supratentorial anomalies found with CM-I and CM-II include dysgenesis or absence of the corpus callosum, agenesis of the septum pellucidum, polymicrogyria of the cerebral hemispheres, and heterotopia of cerebral gray matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13-15</a>]. In addition, CM-II is rarely associated with rhombencephalosynapsis, consisting of agenesis of the cerebellar vermis with fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24684203\"><span class=\"h2\">Chiari type III</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rare Chiari III malformation (CM-III) combines inferior displacement of the medulla with a high cervical or occipital encephalocele that typically contains much of the cerebellum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74322\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74322 \">image 4</a>) and may also involve supratentorial tissue, including the occipital cortex and part of the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>].

Multiple theories have been proposed, though none explains all the features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The molecular genetic theory postulates that Chiari malformations result from primary defects in the genetic programming of hindbrain segmentation and of growth of associated bone and cranial structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>]. Another growth abnormality theory proposes that collision between caudally-directed cranial growth and rostrally-directed cervical growth is the underlying abnormality in CM-I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. However, most Chiari malformations are sporadic and not inherited. Thus, the cause might be either a spontaneous mutation or deletion, or a mutation induced by an exogenous teratogen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The crowding theory postulates that restricted growth of the posterior fossa causes compression of neural tissue, which is then squeezed through the foramen magnum like toothpaste through a tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21</a>]. In support of this theory, the posterior fossa is abnormally small and the torcula is displaced downward in patients with Chiari malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hydrodynamic pulsion theory suggests that early progressive fetal hydrocephalus pushes down on the brainstem and cerebellum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The oligo-cerebrospinal fluid theory proposes that defective closure of the neural tube in early fetal development results in leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, and thus insufficient cerebrospinal volume to fully distend the embryonic ventricular system, which leads to a small posterior fossa and cerebral disorganization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One early theory suggested that the downward displacement of the cerebellar tissue was due to traction by a tethered cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/22-24,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24,28</a>]. However, several studies have demonstrated that the caudal traction on a tethered cord is only transmitted rostrally as far as the caudal-most pair of dentate ligaments, thus disputing the notion that traction transmitted all the way to the brainstem and cerebellum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/25,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29,30</a>]. Furthermore, not all Chiari malformations are associated with tethering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>Chiari type I malformation can be due to either neuroectodermal or mesodermal anomalies. Isolated CM-I is thought to be of mesodermal origin. In contrast, CM-I that is associated with syndromic or nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, or associated with other neurological disorders such as mental retardation and epilepsy, is thought to be of neuroectodermal origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Occasionally, CM-I can be associated with occult spinal dysraphism (ie, spinal bifida occulta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The remaining types of Chiari malformations are due to neuroectodermal anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of spinal cord cavitations (syringomyelia) associated with Chiari malformations has been the subject of debate. Initially it was thought to be due to cerebrospinal fluid being forced into the central canal because of impaired subarachnoid circulation at the level of the foramen magnum. However, cine phase contrast MRI studies have shown that the syrinx of Chiari malformations is noncommunicating. Therefore, it is more likely that the syrinx results from craniospinal pressure dissociation due to the blockage of cerebrospinal fluid flow in the subarachnoid space at the level of the foramen magnum. This leads to pressure backup into the venous system, with initial engorgement of the Virchow-Robin spaces. The excess fluid then dissipates into the substance of the spinal cord leading to spinal cord edema. As fluid accumulates beyond the resorptive power of the parenchyma, it dissipates into the central canal and dilates it, leading to syrinx formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10173927\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true frequency of CM-I is unknown. In the MRI era (that is, since about 1985), CM-I is increasingly detected, with a prevalence in some studies of 0.1 to 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Although once believed to be a disease of adolescence and adulthood, CM-I is now recognized in younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Prior to the advent of neuroimaging with MRI, CM-I was only diagnosed when patients presented with symptoms that warranted investigation. Therefore, in most early series, there were no children younger than 12 years, and it was mistakenly assumed that CM-I occurred only in adolescents and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, with the widespread use of MRI, asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients are being diagnosed at earlier ages. Thus, CM-I is the most common type of Chiari malformation. The most frequent type of Chiari malformation presenting in childhood is CM-II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5294754\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In retrospective studies, Chiari malformations have been associated with Robin sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], neurofibromatosis type 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], and Noonan syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. As an example, in one report of 198 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 who had neuroimaging, CM-I was found in approximately 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, among 130 patients who had surgery for CM-I, neurofibromatosis type 1 was diagnosed in 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

The major categories of symptoms are those related to obstructive hydrocephalus, abnormal eye movements, cerebellar deficits, and spinal myelomeningocele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with CM-I are spared the latter, as they do not have neural tube defects such as a myelomeningocele.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7708132\"><span class=\"h2\">Chiari type I</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true natural history of CM-I has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In most cases, CM-I does not become symptomatic until adolescence or adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. In addition, symptom onset is often insidious. In one study of 43 patients with CM-I, the mean age at presentation was approximately 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The manifestations of CM-I derive mainly from the following categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1,4,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,39,40</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated intracranial pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cranial neuropathies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brainstem compression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myelopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain (mainly neck pain and occipital headache)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syringomyelia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81030\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81030 \">image 5</a>), often accompanied by scoliosis, and presyrinx</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-related breathing disorders</p><p/><p>In addition, there are asymptomatic cases where the radiologic diagnosis of CM-I is discovered incidentally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Cranial neuropathies or brainstem compression can present with hoarseness, vocal cord paralysis, dysarthria, palatal weakness, pharyngeal achalasia, tongue atrophy, recurrent aspiration, nystagmus (especially down-beating), or sleep-related breathing disorders such as central and obstructive sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1,4,39,40,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,39,40,43,44</a>]. Less common symptoms and signs include oscillopsia, sensorineural hearing loss, sinus bradycardia, syncope and hiccups. Other manifestations of brainstem compression include long-tract signs such as weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski responses. The latter can result from either brainstem or spinal cord compression. Cerebellar symptoms include nystagmus, scanning speech and ataxia, with truncal ataxia being more common than appendicular ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/32,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,39</a>].</p><p>Scoliosis is usually due to an asymmetric spinal syringomyelia leading to differential growth of the hemicords and the vertebral column [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Since the advent of MRI, syringomyelia is often diagnosed prior to reaching the stage of the classic cape-like suspended sensory loss. Thus, scoliosis has become the most common presenting symptom of a spinal syrinx.</p><p>In children with CM-I, an associated syrinx occurs in 30 percent. Of patients with neurologic deficits due to a syrinx, the earliest sign is loss of the superficial abdominal reflexes. Other signs and symptoms include gait disturbance, radicular pain, dysesthesia, upper motor neuron signs in the legs, and lower motor neuron signs maximally in the arms in those with a cervical syrinx, the most common location associated with CM-I. Of note, patients may also have signs and symptoms of brainstem dysfunction if the syrinx extends into the medulla (syringobulbia).</p><p>Presyrinx is a potentially reversible condition characterized by spinal cord edema due to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/40,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,45</a>]. It occurs most often in the cervical region and is detected by MRI, appearing similar to a true syrinx on T2-weighted images but lacking discrete cavitation on T1-weighted sequences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75789\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75789 \">image 6</a>).</p><p>Pain or headache due to meningeal irritation is the most common presentation in patients with CM-I. The pain is usually either occipital or nuchal in location. The pain is typically paroxysmal, but it may be dull and persistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Both the pain and a feeling of dizziness are exacerbated by physical activity or by Valsalva maneuvers such as coughing, laughing, or sneezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/4,32,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,32,46</a>]. Thus, patients with CM-I may present with cough headache, and CM-I should be considered as a potential etiology in secondary cough headache. It is postulated that Valsalva maneuvers leads to exacerbation of the pain by causing impaction of the cerebellar tonsils at the foramen magnum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Although CM-I typically is not symptomatic in young children, one retrospective series identified 39 patients younger than six years who had early surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Children up to age two most often presented with oropharyngeal dysfunction, while those ages three to five typically presented with syringomyelia, scoliosis, or headache.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7706943\"><span class=\"h2\">Chiari type II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because it is nearly always associated with a lumbosacral or thoracic myelomeningocele, CM-II is usually detected prenatally or at birth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71208\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71208 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In late infancy and childhood, progressive hydrocephalus is a common problem in CM-II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, CM-II may be associated with one or more of the syndromes associated with CM-I, such as syringomyelia and scoliosis. (See <a href=\"#H7708132\" class=\"local\">'Chiari type I'</a> above.)</p><p>Despite the extensive malformations, some patients with CM-II have normal intelligence and function well independently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20314753\"><span class=\"h2\">Chiari type III</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This rare malformation is associated with a high cervical or occipital encephalocele that typically contains much of the cerebellum and may also involve supratentorial tissue, including the occipital cortex and part of the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>]. Data are limited regarding the natural history and clinical course of CM-III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients with CM-III have a high mortality rate, often due to respiratory failure in infancy. Those who survive beyond the neonatal period often have severe neurologic impairments, such as mental retardation, epilepsy, hypotonia or spasticity, upper and lower motor neuron signs, and lower cranial nerve palsies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10173939\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Chiari malformations is based upon neuroanatomy. There are no biomarkers in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or cultured tissue to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, neuroimaging is of prime importance, and MRI is the best imaging modality for evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/11,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,51</a>]. Sagittal, coronal, and axial views of the brain along with sagittal and axial images of the entire spinal cord (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar) using T1 and T2-weighted MRI sequences are useful for detecting cerebellar and brainstem displacement, associated craniocervical junction abnormalities, and hydrosyringomyelia. CT, especially thin-section multiplanar CT with reformatted images, retains importance in the evaluation of the associated bony abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1308662\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic aspects'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients who cannot have MRI, high-resolution CT scan with sagittal reconstructions can be used to make the diagnosis of Chiari malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. </p><p>In some cases of fetal ventriculomegaly, a Chiari malformation can be diagnosed in utero using fetal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p>There is general agreement among experts that the radiologic diagnosis of CM-I in adolescents and adults is made by MRI when one or both cerebellar tonsils are displaced by &ge;5 mm below the foramen magnum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/8,11,42,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,42,56,57</a>]. Borderline displacement of the cerebellar tonsils (&ge;3 to &lt;5 mm below the foramen magnum) is considered pathologic if it is associated with additional features of CM-I, such as other craniocervical junction anomalies or syringomyelia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

In the patients with CM-I, the mean position of the cerebellar tonsils was 13 mm below the foramen magnum (range 3 to 29 mm below). In the normal subjects, the mean position of the tonsils was 1 mm above the foramen magnum (range 8 mm above to 5 mm below). In infants, however, tonsils as low as 6 mm below the foramen magnum may be normal, since the cerebellar tonsils have been shown to ascend with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>As noted earlier, Chiari malformations are typically associated with a small posterior fossa. On neuroimaging, this may result in obliteration of the subarachnoid spaces at the level of the foramen magnum. </p><p>The diagnosis of CM-II should be suspected in a fetus or newborn with clinical evidence of a spinal myelomeningocele. MRI can confirm the diagnosis of CM-II by demonstrating downward displacement of inferior cerebellar vermis and medulla through the foramen magnum into the upper cervical canal.</p><p>Similarly, the diagnosis of CM-III is made in a fetus or newborn with clinical evidence of a high <span class=\"nowrap\">cervical/occipital</span> encephalocele and confirmatory MRI showing inferior displacement of the medulla and a high cervical or occipital encephalocele with descent of cerebellar structures into the malformation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10173945\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of Chiari malformations depends upon the nature of the malformation and the degree of associated neurologic impairments. Particularly for CM-II and CM-III, surgical interventions may include closure of open neural tube defects shortly after birth, treatment for hydrocephalus (most often by use of a shunt), and decompression of tight posterior fossa structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

However, not all experts agree with this approach, and a minority advocates prophylactic surgery to prevent development of syringomyelia and other associated complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Decompressive surgery is indicated for patients with CM-I who are clearly symptomatic with lower cranial nerve palsies, syringomyelia, myelopathy, cerebellar symptoms, severe neck pain, or occipital headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

As discussed below, there are occasional reports of spontaneous resolution of tonsillar displacement or syringomyelia within the context of CM-I. Therefore, some have argued that a period of watchful observation is warranted in asymptomatic children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10173951\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.) </p><p>Cine phase contrast MRI may be valuable in certain patients with CM-I to look for impairment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow across the foramen magnum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/11,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,64</a>]. This information can be used to select patients for surgical decompression of the foramen magnum in order to establish normal CSF flow. Thus, some have recommended obtaining a cine phase contrast MRI in all patients with CM-I; those patients without CSF flow obstruction would undergo a watchful observation strategy, while patients with CSF flow obstruction on cine MRI, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, would be treated with surgery.</p><p>We suggest obtaining a cine phase contrast MRI for asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic patients with CM-I who are neurologically intact but have syringomyelia on MRI. We refer such patients for surgery if the study shows complete CSF flow obstruction. Alternatively, we continue to follow them with clinical and neuroimaging surveillance if the study shows partial or no CSF flow obstruction, but refer patients for posterior fossa decompression at the first sign of clinical deterioration.</p><p>In small uncontrolled studies, obstruction of CSF flow correlated with clinical symptoms, and a postsurgical increase in CSF flow was associated with clinical improvement or stabilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. Cine phase contrast MRI may also be useful for postoperative follow-up of patients with &quot;failed&quot; surgeries, such as those who experience delayed deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Furthermore, a retrospective report of 130 patients who had decompressive surgery for CM-I found that normal CSF flow by cine phase contrast MRI before surgery was predictive of symptom recurrence after surgery (relative risk 4.8, 95% CI 1.9-12.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. This result suggests that even symptomatic patients with CM-I may not benefit from decompressive surgery if there is no evidence of CSF flow obstruction. </p><p>Polysomnography should be considered in patients who present with sleep apnea, to demonstrate whether their sleep apnea is central or peripheral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The procedure involves a limited suboccipital craniectomy, C1 laminectomy, duraplasty and arachnoid dissection. In an international survey conducted between October 2001 and March 2002, approximately three-quarters of the 76 neurosurgeons who responded favored opening the dural sac [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

A meta-analysis published in 2008 identified seven pediatric studies that compared posterior fossa decompression (PFD) surgery with and without duraplasty for children with CM-I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The following observations were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was a higher rate of clinical improvement for PFD with duraplasty compared with PFD without duraplasty (79 versus 65 percent, relative risk [RR] 1.23, 95% CI 0.95-1.59) and a higher rate of postoperative reduction in syringomyelia size (87 versus 56 percent, RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.91-2.25).

In addition, the complication rates for individual centers and surgeons vary widely. As an example, a retrospective series of 40 patients (mean age 13.3 years, range 3 to 45 years) with CM-I who had decompression with duraplasty reported a low perioperative complication rate (3 percent), attributable to the development of a pseudomeningocele in one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

It is most often used for patients who fail posterior decompression. Some experts advocate this approach to reoperation when cine phase contrast MRI imaging shows anterior obstruction of CSF flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

In addition, some surgeons employ shunting rather than posterior fossa decompression as primary treatment for syringomyelia associated with CM-I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], while others routinely combine posterior fossa decompression with shunting for such cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. However, syrinx shunts are controversial, particularly as primary therapy for CM-I related syringomyelia, on the basis of lesser benefit than bony decompression reported in some studies, and the potential for acute deterioration due to shunt malfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10173951\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical course of CM-I is unpredictable.

Limited evidence suggests that most patients with minimal or no symptoms remain stable. In one report, a series of 22 children with CM-I who had mild or absent clinical manifestations were followed without surgery for a mean period of 5.9 years (range 3 to 19 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chiari-malformations/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. At last follow-up, symptoms were absent or improved for 17 patients (77 percent), while clinical deterioration was noted for five (23 percent). The deterioration was mild in two patients. The remaining three patients required surgery. Syringomyelia was present at study entry in only one child and did not change over 19 years of follow-up. However, cervical syringomyelia developed de novo in three children during follow-up.</p><p>Surgical outcome for CM-I varies.

At a median follow-up of 88 months, clinical improvement or stabilization was noted in 63 and 31 percent, while deterioration or death occurred in 6 and 1 percent. Factors associated with a poor outcome were older age at surgery and the presence of a long-tract deficit.

(See <a href=\"#H24684417\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course of CM-I is unpredictable. Limited evidence suggests that most patients with minimal or no symptoms remain stable. In largely retrospective series, postoperative improvement or stabilization has been reported for the majority of patients who have posterior fossa decompression.
