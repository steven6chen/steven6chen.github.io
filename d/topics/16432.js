In such patients, a cardiac embolus most commonly originating from the left atrial appendage is a common cause of ischemic stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;, section on 'Brain ischemia'</a>.)</p><p>Issues specific to stroke in patients with AF will be reviewed here. The risk of atheroembolism (including stroke), the role of anticoagulant prophylaxis (primary prevention) in patients with AF, and the general evaluation and management of the patient with stroke are presented elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;, section on 'Distinguishing stroke subtypes'</a>.)</p><p>AF is associated with more severe ischemic strokes and &quot;longer&quot; transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) than emboli from carotid disease, presumably due to embolization of larger particles with AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This relationship was illustrated in a report comparing ischemic brain events in patients with AF and those with carotid disease in two major trials: The ratio of hemispheric events to retinal events was 25:1 with AF compared with 2:1 with carotid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, patients with AF who suffer an ischemic stroke appear to have a worse outcome (more disability, greater mortality) than those who have an ischemic stroke in the absence of AF, even after adjustment for the advanced age of patients with AF-related stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The &quot;longer&quot; TIAs typical in AF patients are more often associated with abnormal magnetic resonance diffusion imaging and would be classified as strokes by the revised American Heart Association definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to causing symptomatic stroke with major deficits, AF is also associated with silent cerebral infarctions and TIAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The frequency of silent cerebral infarction was evaluated in a report of 516 patients with nonrheumatic AF in the Veterans Administration SPINAF trial; computed tomography scanning was performed initially and, in the absence of neurologic symptoms, at the end of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. One or more silent cerebral infarctions were seen at presentation in 15 percent; the estimated rate of new silent cerebral infarcts was about 1.3 percent per year at up to three years of follow-up with a similar &quot;silent&quot; event rate for placebo and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>.</p><p>Anticoagulated AF patients who experience ischemic stroke typically have smaller infarcts with a lower mortality rate compared with AF patients with strokes who are not anticoagulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This is likely explained by a higher fraction of nonembolic strokes among anticoagulated AF patients and small size of embolic strokes: anticoagulation greatly reduced the likelihood of large stroke due to left atrial emboli, so that the remaining strokes are from cerebral small artery disease or other mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have suffered a stroke are likely to have had a cardioembolic event. On the other hand, AF is common in older adults, who often are at risk for other types of stroke. Thus, the presence of AF in a stroke patient does not always mean that there is a causal relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As a result, all patients with a stroke, even in the setting of AF, need consideration of other causes of stroke, especially if they would result in different treatment.</p><p>This evaluation does not usually differ from the evaluation of other stroke patients. In an occasional patient with relative contraindications to anticoagulation, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be helpful to define the likelihood for embolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those AF patients with stroke in whom an embolus seems likely, other sources than the left atrium or left atrial appendage (LAA) need to be considered. Embolism refers to particles of debris originating elsewhere that block arterial access to a particular brain region. Embolic strokes may arise from a source in the heart, aorta, or large vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55099 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Thromboembolism of aortic atheroma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from aortic plaque: Thromboembolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiographic evaluation is recommended for stroke patients, primarily to investigate the conditions associated with AF. Because chronic anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant is strongly recommended in all eligible patients, echocardiography often will not have a significant impact on anticoagulant management decisions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of echocardiography in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Residual LAA thrombus (after embolic stroke) is rarely seen on transthoracic echocardiography but is detected by TEE in approximately 45 percent of patients presenting with an acute embolic event in the setting of new onset AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Even when not seen on TEE, an intracardiac thrombus is presumed to have been present in all patients with AF who have had a recent thromboembolic event. This hypothesis is based in part upon the observations that microscopic thrombus can be identified in most patients with chronic sustained AF at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and that patients with a recent thromboembolism and newly recognized AF are significantly more likely to have spontaneous echo contrast, a marker of stasis, than similar patients without a thromboembolic event (87 versus 48 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;, section on 'Select an anticoagulant'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, diagnostic evaluation by TEE to search for a residual intraatrial thrombus is not essential since the absence of a thrombus will not alter the long-term clinical (anticoagulation) management. However, TEE may be reasonable if cardioversion is desired to confirm absence of residual thrombus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of echocardiography in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H400131632\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those in sinus rhythm without a history of AF, cardiac monitoring is recommended for at least the first 24 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke to identify AF or atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The utility of this approach is illustrated by the findings of a systematic review of five prospective studies that included a total of 588 hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke who had Holter monitoring for 21 to 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Monitoring detected new AF or atrial flutter in 4.6 percent of these patients (95% CI 0-12.7).</p><p>Holter monitoring or continuous telemetry may be most useful in patients with a history of palpitations or evidence of spontaneous echo contrast on TEE, and multiple cryptogenic transient ischemic attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although the electrocardiogram and Holter monitoring can identify patients who have AF, the demonstration of normal sinus rhythm does not exclude intermittent AF.

Based on estimates of attributable risk, ipsilateral stenosis of at least 70 percent stenosis is equally likely to be the cause of cerebral ischemia as is cardiogenic embolism. Consequently, carotid endarterectomy or stenting seems reasonable for AF patients with high-grade ipsilateral stenosis, followed by chronic anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, although this approach is empiric, without good supporting evidence. The management of symptomatic carotid artery disease is discussed elsewhere.
