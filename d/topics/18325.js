Although the human polyomaviruses are highly seroprevalent in humans, they appear to cause clinical disease only among immunocompromised patients. BK virus and JC virus are the two classical human polyoma viruses.</p><p>In kidney transplant recipients, the major diseases associated with BK virus are tubulointerstitial nephritis and ureteral stenosis. BK virus may cause clinical disease of the genitourinary tract due in part to its tropism for renourinary epithelium.</p><p>The first association of BK with ureteral stenosis was in the seminal 1971 publication reporting isolation of a new virus, BK, named for the initials of the first patient who presented three months after transplant with obstructive uropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ureteral-stenosis-due-to-bk-virus-infection-among-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It remains uncertain whether BK virus is the primary cause of ureteric stenosis or whether BK virus infects previously injured ureter (from ischemia or other trauma) as a secondary insult.</p><p>Ureteral stenosis associated with BK virus infection among kidney transplant recipients is discussed in this topic review. BK-induced nephritis in kidney transplant recipients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of BK virus-induced (polyomavirus-induced) nephropathy in kidney transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of BK virus-induced (polyomavirus-induced) nephropathy in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of ureteral stenosis due to BK virus infection among renal allograft recipients is approximately 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ureteral-stenosis-due-to-bk-virus-infection-among-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In the renal transplant setting, ureteral stenosis (which occurs from 0.5 to 6 percent in the general transplant population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ureteral-stenosis-due-to-bk-virus-infection-among-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]) has traditionally been attributed to either surgical technique or watershed infarction of the distal ureter and not to BK viral involvement.</p><p>An increased incidence of BK viremia and nephropathy has been associated with the use of ureteral stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ureteral-stenosis-due-to-bk-virus-infection-among-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. In one study of 600 adult kidney transplant recipients, of whom 15 percent developed BK viremia, placement of stents, but not the duration of stents, was associated with BK viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ureteral-stenosis-due-to-bk-virus-infection-among-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying pathogenesis of ureteral stenosis associated with BK virus infection is unclear. In a nonhuman primate model of transplantation, ureteric stenosis was associated with a new cynomolgus polyomavirus (CPV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ureteral-stenosis-due-to-bk-virus-infection-among-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Histology revealed a mixed lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrate extending throughout the muscularis and focally into the mucosa in the first months after transplant with detectable virus. The authors felt that this was the pathogenesis for the late development (after three months) of ureteral stenosis that they observed. However, CPV was not detectable after the third month.</p><p>BK virus has also been observed in ureteric epithelium in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ureteral-stenosis-due-to-bk-virus-infection-among-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In this setting, the epithelium can be sloughed or, in some cases, the ureteric wall is destroyed and replaced with granulation tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ureteral-stenosis-due-to-bk-virus-infection-among-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This may result in stenosis.</p><p>A modeling study has suggested that the pathogenesis begins with initial reactivation within renal tubules, followed by secondary <span class=\"nowrap\">seeding/reactivation</span> within urothelium, followed by expansion within urothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ureteral-stenosis-due-to-bk-virus-infection-among-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Other data support that BK appears to be an ascending infection in some settings. This was suggested by a case report of bilateral BK virus-associated ureteral stenosis in a recipient of an unmatched, related hematopoietic cell transplant for acute myelogenous leukemia, an unusual host for BK virus-associated ureteral stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ureteral-stenosis-due-to-bk-virus-infection-among-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One month after transplant, the patient developed hemorrhagic cystitis associated with initial BK viruria of 1.2 x 10<sup>8</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span>. One week later the patient was found to have bilateral ureteral stenosis at the level of the ureteral pelvic junction, which progressed to stenosis of the entire ureter, bilaterally, despite reduction in immunosuppressive agents. Percutaneous nephrostomy tubes were placed, and renal function returned to normal. After eight months, the BK viruria and viremia had returned to levels normally seen with stem cell transplant recipients, and the percutaneous nephrostomy tubes were able to be removed with adequate anterograde flow of urine and near-normal caliber of the ureters.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ureteral stenosis associated with BK virus present with symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of urinary tract obstruction, particularly an increase in the serum creatinine concentration. However, since the renal transplant is not innervated, pain and discomfort that may be observed in nontransplant patients are normally absent.</p><p>Obstruction due to ureteral <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/stricture</span> associated with BK virus occurs two to four months posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ureteral-stenosis-due-to-bk-virus-infection-among-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], which corresponds to the peak onset of BK virus reactivation in kidney transplant recipients. This timing differs substantively from stenosis due to ischemia, which typically occurs 7 to 10 days posttransplant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ureteral stenosis may improve in association with reduction of BK viruria and viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ureteral-stenosis-due-to-bk-virus-infection-among-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With ureteral stenosis, radiologic evidence of obstruction is most commonly determined by initial evaluation with ultrasonography, showing hydronephrosis. Additional findings <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tests are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If ureteral stenosis is found radiologically, BK virus should be suspected if BK viruria or viremia is present. The presence of BK virus-induced histologic changes in the ureter is supportive of the diagnosis. Typical histopathologic changes are inflammation, epithelial sloughing, and fibrosis. Evidence of active BK virus replication may be lacking at the time of resection of the strictured ureter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of BK virus-induced (polyomavirus-induced) nephropathy in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No studies examining the optimal therapy of those with BK virus-associated ureteral stenosis have been performed. Interventions are primarily radiologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical maneuvers aimed at relieving the obstruction. These include placing a percutaneous nephrostomy tube <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stent or surgical resection of the stenotic ureter with reimplantation.</p><p>After initial decompression with a percutaneous nephrostomy tube, early excision and reimplantation of the ureter to the bladder or a transplant ureter to native ureter anastomosis is the most expedient way to correct the stricture and relieve the obstruction. We suggest early surgical correction because it can remove infected ureteral tissue, is less likely to be associated with persistent stenosis, and is more convenient.</p><p>The presence of BK virus among those with ureteral stenosis also suggests that reduction of immunosuppression should be one component of the treatment strategy, especially if BK viremia is present. Antiviral therapy likely will not reverse the stricture. Instead, it is instituted to help prevent progression to BK virus nephropathy, if not present concurrently. This is discussed separately.
