Since EVAR does not require intrathoracic or intraabdominal exposure of the aorta, or aortic cross-clamping, perioperative morbidity and mortality are reduced compared with open repair. Also, EVAR has made treatment possible for some patients with comorbidities who might not otherwise be candidates for aortic repair.</p><p>Vascular access for EVAR is achieved through access to the femoral vessels, either percutaneously or via small incisions; thus, the procedure may be accomplished with the aid of local anesthesia with monitored anesthesia care, neuraxial regional anesthesia, or general anesthesia. This topic will review the preoperative anesthesia consultation and each of these anesthetic options for thoracic or abdominal EVAR. The surgical techniques and endovascular devices used for EVAR, as well as complications of the procedure, are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Although endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is associated with lower perioperative morbidity and mortality compared with open surgical repair, there is some risk that conversion to open (eg, intrathoracic or intraabdominal) repair will become necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

The preoperative ECG is evaluated for Q-waves or significant ST-segment elevation or depression (which raises the possibility of myocardial ischemia or infarction), left ventricular hypertrophy, QTc prolongation, bundle-branch block, or arrhythmia.</p><p>Additional cardiac testing is indicated only in patients having a high risk for perioperative cardiovascular events (eg, recent myocardial infarction or unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, high-grade arrhythmias, or hemodynamically important valvular heart disease), and is focused on changes in symptoms and functional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6</a>].

This is primarily due to the administration of intravenous contrast agents, but also due to the potential dislodgement of embolic debris by manipulation of intravascular catheters and wires near the renal arteries, or impingement of the renal ostia by the graft. Patients undergoing emergency endovascular therapy for a ruptured aneurysm have a higher incidence of renal as well as other complications.

If renal function has decreased, sufficient time between the last contrast dye load and the time of operation should be allowed to elapse if possible (typically two weeks). Consultation with a nephrologist is prudent.

Surgeons require an immobile patient as they strive to position modular graft components. Typically, access to the aorta is gained via the femoral or iliac arteries. Rarely, retroperitoneal vascular access is necessary; in these instances, local anesthesia with MAC is not adequate. General anesthesia may be preferable for patients who are extremely anxious and those who are unable to cooperate, remain motionless, or lie supine (eg, due to heart failure or back pain).</p><p>There are no randomized trials comparing anesthetic techniques for abdominal EVAR. However, data from observational studies suggest that local or regional anesthesia techniques are at least equivalent to general anesthesia, and may confer some benefit with respect to hospital length of stay and morbidity. In a 2012 systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 observational studies including 13,459 patients who received either <span class=\"nowrap\">local/regional</span> or general anesthesia, there was no difference between the groups in 30-day mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients receiving local anesthesia had shorter operating times and hospital stays, and were less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), compared with patients receiving general anesthesia. However, <span class=\"nowrap\">local/regional</span> anesthesia was not consistently beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and the absence of data from randomized trials limits interpretation of these findings.</p><p>Similarly, there are no randomized trials comparing anesthetic techniques for thoracic EVAR. In one single-center prospective study that included 400 consecutive thoracic EVAR cases, multivariate analysis revealed that general anesthesia was a risk factor for mortality compared with regional anesthesia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-2.50) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Selection bias was likely since general anesthesia was used most commonly in this center's early experience; with increasing experience, general anesthesia was used only when the patient was unable to cooperate during the procedure. Also, in the years since this study was performed, changes in stent technology (eg, decreased size and increased flexibility) have improved the likelihood of success with local or regional anesthesia.

However, progression from a &quot;light&quot; level of sedation to &quot;deep&quot; sedation (or unconsciousness) may occur suddenly, particularly in the older patient.

A systematic approach to decrease the risk of postoperative paraparesis or paraplegia may be employed after endovascular stent repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms, including frequent neurologic assessment, arterial pressure augmentation, somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage if necessary to treat developing neurologic deficits (see <a href=\"#H383873913\" class=\"local\">'Management of spinal cord ischemia'</a> above). When this approach was applied in one study of patients undergoing endovascular stent repair of descending thoracic aneurysms, permanent neurologic deficit due to spinal cord ischemia was limited to 2.7 percent (after postoperative evidence of spinal cord ischemia had been initially noted in 6.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Most clinicians choose to wait for neurologic deficits to develop (since it is rare after endovascular procedures), and then intervene with immediate placement of a CSF drain.
