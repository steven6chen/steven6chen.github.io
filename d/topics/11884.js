They are one of the most commonly used kinds of medicines.</p><p>NSAIDs can help people who have conditions that cause ongoing pain, such as arthritis. They can also help people heal more quickly after an injury. But NSAIDs can cause problems of their own, so it's important to take the lowest dose you need for the shortest time.</p><p>You can buy many NSAIDs without a prescription, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (brand name: Aleve). These same NSAIDs can also be prescribed by a doctor, usually at a higher strength. Plus, there are many other prescription-strength NSAIDs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1726705\"><span class=\"h1\">Are all NSAIDs the same?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes and no. All NSAIDs work on the same chemical process in the body, but they do it in different ways. Some NSAIDs need to be taken more often during the day than others to work for certain kinds of pain. And some are more likely than others to cause certain side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1726712\"><span class=\"h1\">Are NSAIDs safe for everyone?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. People with certain medical conditions should avoid NSAIDs or use them with care. Talk with your doctor if you use NSAIDs without a prescription (called &quot;over-the-counter&quot;) on a regular basis to be sure they are safe for you.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have an <strong>ulcer in your stomach or intestine or you have ever had bleeding in the gut</strong>, ask your doctor if NSAIDs are safe for you. Your doctor might suggest that you take an NSAID along with a medicine that can protect your stomach and intestines. That's because NSAIDs can damage your stomach or intestines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have <strong>heart disease or ever had a stroke</strong>, ask your doctor if it is safe to take an NSAID. NSAIDs can increase the risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. This is especially true for people who already have heart disease or risk factors like high blood pressure. But if your doctor prescribes low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> to prevent heart attacks or stroke, you should take it as directed. At low doses, aspirin can actually protect you from these problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have <strong>kidney disease, heart failure, cirrhosis, or you take medicines called diuretics</strong> (also called &quot;water pills&quot;), avoid NSAIDs completely. NSAIDs can make heart failure, kidney disease, and cirrhosis worse. NSAIDs can also cause kidney problems in people taking diuretics or certain other medicines to control blood pressure. This can happen in people with very mild kidney disease or in older people.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have <strong>high blood pressure</strong>, ask your doctor if NSAIDs are safe for you. NSAIDs can raise blood pressure even in people who are taking medicine for high blood pressure. Experts recommend that people with high blood pressure who need NSAIDs take the lowest possible dose for the shortest amount of time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have any <strong>disorders that increase the risk of bleeding</strong>, ask your doctor if NSAIDs are safe for you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you <strong>are having surgery</strong>, ask your doctor if you should stop taking NSAIDs. Most people need to stop NSAIDs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, a week before surgery to lower the risk of bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you <strong>are pregnant</strong>, avoid NSAIDs during the last 3 months of pregnancy. They are probably safe to use when breastfeeding, but check with your doctor or nurse if you are breastfeeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you <strong>take any other prescription or non-prescription medicines</strong>, or you take any herbal medicines, ask your doctor or pharmacist if NSAIDs are safe for you. This is especially important if you take:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood thinners, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> (brand name: Coumadin) or heparin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Phenytoin</a> (brand names: Dilantin, Phenytek), a medicine used to prevent seizures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Cyclosporine</a>, a medicine given to people who have had an organ transplant</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1726719\"><span class=\"h1\">What side effects can NSAIDs cause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, NSAIDs cause no side effects. The side effects they do cause can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stomach upset, ulcers, and bleeding</strong> &ndash; NSAIDs can cause stomach upset. If you take them regularly for a long time, NSAIDs can also cause ulcers or bleeding in the stomach or intestines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liver damage</strong> &ndash; Long-term use of NSAIDs, especially at high doses, can harm the liver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Kidney damage</strong> &ndash; Using NSAIDs, even for a short time, can harm the kidneys. They are especially risky in people who already have kidney disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ringing in the ears</strong> &ndash; Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) is common in people who take high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>. It can also happen in people who take other NSAIDs. The ringing usually goes away when they take a lower dose.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1726726\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if I take more than the recommended dose?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Taking more than the recommended dose of an NSAID might not cause serious problems. But it could make side effects much more likely without helping your symptoms very much. On the other hand, taking too much <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) can be harmful or even cause death.</p><p>Anybody who takes too much of any medicine at once should call a doctor or the Poison Control Hotline (1-800-222-1222). If the person is not breathing or is not conscious, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1726768\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
