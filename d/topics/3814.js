The consequences of CPP deposition include acute inflammatory arthritis, inflammatory and degenerative chronic arthropathies, and radiographic cartilage calcification and constitute the spectrum of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of CPPD disease are discussed here. The pathogenesis and etiology of this disorder and the treatment of CPPD diseases are discussed separately.

Based upon a review of the relevant literature, however, a European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) consensus panel suggested alternative terminology (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below); the panel also reviewed diagnostic approaches to these conditions and the evidence supporting these approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In view of its wider acceptance in the literature since the introduction of this terminology in 2011, we will place primary emphasis here on the EULAR task force terminology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], in which the term &quot;calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;CPPD&quot;) is proposed as the umbrella term for all instances of calcium pyrophosphate crystal occurrence.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite their limitations, the clinical syndromes and findings implied by the traditional terms for CPPD disease are likely to be retained to a greater or lesser extent by some clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Familiarity with the older nomenclature may, in addition, be useful in instances where literature searches using only EULAR task force terms overlook citations indexed under the traditional terms. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pseudogout</strong> &ndash; Pseudogout accurately describes acute attacks of CPPD-induced synovitis, which clinically resemble acute attacks of urate gout. However, the majority of individuals with CPPD never experience such episodes, and the range of clinical events characterizing gout and CPPD disease extend well beyond those that characterize acute gouty arthritis. For these reasons, the EULAR consensus panel prefers the term &quot;acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis&quot; instead of pseudogout.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Notably, however, the use of the term &quot;pseudogout&quot; has also been used more broadly to direct attention to the shared clinical features of the two major crystal-induced arthritides (gout and pseudogout) that are seen much less commonly in other joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or spondyloarthritis. These features include recurrent, usually monoarticular, flares of inflammatory arthritis that are self-limited in duration and most often resolve completely. Retention of the diagnostically useful concept of a shared clinical profile of crystal-induced arthritis has merit, as does the mandate to distinguish gout from pseudogout with respect to therapeutic approaches. Thus, use of the term &quot;pseudogout&quot; for acute CPP crystal arthritis will likely persist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chondrocalcinosis</strong> &ndash; Chondrocalcinosis refers to radiographic calcification in hyaline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrocartilage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54821\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54821 \">image 1</a>). It is commonly present in patients with CPP crystal deposition disease but is neither absolutely specific for CPPD nor universal among affected patients. The EULAR panel designates this finding as &quot;cartilage calcification (CC).&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pyrophosphate arthropathy</strong> &ndash; Pyrophosphate arthropathy is the term sometimes used for the joint diseases or radiographic abnormalities accompanying CPP crystal deposition. Although this name has little justification in terms of the pathologic anatomy of the disorder, evidence of aberrant inorganic pyrophosphate metabolism in the pathogenesis of CPPD disease may legitimize use of this term. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and etiology of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56278115\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease has been estimated to affect 4 to 7 percent of the adult populations of Europe and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], especially among persons of advanced age. However, an estimate of the prevalence of clinically significant CPPD disease has been more difficult to attain, in large part because the available prevalence estimates have relied primarily upon radiographically detected cartilage calcification rather than clinical evaluation, and also because prevalence data concerning patients less than about 60 years of age are not available.</p><p>The average age at diagnosis of CPPD disease in one study was 72 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

This was illustrated in a report that supplemented radiographs of the knees with radiographs of the hands, wrists, and pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The prevalence of radiographic calcium pyrophosphate deposition according to age, among 100 consecutive patients admitted to an acute geriatric unit, was:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>65 to 74 years &ndash; 15 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>75 to 84 years &ndash; 36 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&gt;84 years &ndash; Almost 50 percent</p><p/><p>The gender distribution of CPPD disease has differed among large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/3,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,12</a>], but no major gender predominance appears likely. Attacks of acute arthritis may occur more frequently in men, while typical osteoarthritis (OA) with calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition or the atypical pattern of OA characteristic of CPPD are more common in women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of individuals with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP) crystal deposition (CPPD) disease are asymptomatic with respect to joint involvement, and there is considerable diversity in the patterns of joint disease among those who develop symptoms. A clinical classification of CPPD disease emerged from the studies of McCarty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and colleagues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], which drew particular attention to the capacity for the clinical manifestations of this disorder to mimic virtually any type of arthritis, including gout, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), and neuropathic joint disease. This clinical classification (in parentheses below) relates to the nomenclature proposed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) task force [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic CPPD disease (&quot;asymptomatic CPPD&quot;) (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic CPPD disease'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute CPP crystal arthritis (&quot;pseudogout&quot;) (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Acute CPP crystal arthritis'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis (&quot;pseudo-RA&quot;) (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OA with CPPD, with or without superimposed acute attacks (&quot;pseudo-OA&quot;) (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Osteoarthritis with CPPD'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe joint degeneration (pseudo-neuropathic joint disease) (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Severe joint degeneration'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal involvement</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic CPPD disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most joints in which CPP crystal deposition is readily apparent on radiographs are asymptomatic, even among patients in whom acute or chronic clinical manifestations of CPPD disease in one or several other joints have occurred. However, patients with apparent asymptomatic CPPD may be found to have manifestations of an arthritic disorder upon close questioning. As an example, in one series of older patients with radiographic but ostensibly asymptomatic CPP crystal deposition, a higher frequency of wrist complaints and genu varus deformity was reported by questionnaire and detected by examination, respectively, than in a control group of similar age but without radiographic chondrocalcinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute CPP crystal arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Acute CPP crystal arthritis&quot; is characterized by self-limited acute or subacute attacks of arthritis involving only one or several extremity joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The traditional term pseudogout underlines the usually close resemblance of these attacks to those of urate gout, in the accompanying symptoms and signs of severe acute inflammation (intense pain, redness, warmth, swelling, and joint disability), and in the occasional occurrence of synchronous inflammation of several adjacent joints (cluster attacks) or, conversely, petite attacks (which are minimally painful episodes of joint warmth and swelling).</p><p>The knee is affected in over 50 percent of all acute attacks of acute CPP crystal arthritis, while the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint is the most frequently affected in urate gout. Other joints typically affected in acute CPP crystal arthritis include wrists, shoulders, ankles, feet, and elbows. Initial episodes of acute CPP crystal arthritis may persist longer before remitting than the one or two weeks commonly encountered in urate gout, and an upper extremity site of inflammation (wrist, elbow, shoulder) for a first attack should raise suspicion for acute CPP crystal arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Trauma, surgery, or severe medical illness often provoke acute attacks. In particular, flares of acute CPP crystal arthritis after parathyroidectomy have been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; these episodes may be related to abrupt reduction in serum calcium and magnesium levels during postoperative hypoparathyroidism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hungry bone syndrome following parathyroidectomy&quot;</a>). Such reduction may cause partial dissolution of crystals with subsequent release from the cartilage matrix into the joint fluid, allowing phagocytosis and the phlogistic response of inflammatory cells.</p><p>Intraarticular hyaluronate injection and treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>] have also been reported to precipitate acute attacks of pseudogout. However, patients affected with CPPD who experience acute joint inflammation following hyaluronate injection do not demonstrate crystals in their joint fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In our experience, systemic findings and laboratory abnormalities, such as fever, leukocytosis with a left shift in the differential count, and an elevated sedimentation rate and serum C-reactive protein (CRP), occur during attacks of acute CPP crystal arthritis in a small minority of affected patients, and the frequency of each is probably less than in acute gouty arthritis. However, a review of 50 cases of acute CPP crystal arthritis, many of which were polyarticular attacks, described low-grade fevers in 50 percent and frequently elevated sedimentation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In some cases, systemic features accompanying polyarticular acute CPP crystal arthritis are quite prominent and may suggest pyogenic arthritis, osteomyelitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis'</a> below.)</p><p>Rarely, and usually after several acute arthritic flares, palpable and visible masses of CPP crystals, resembling gouty tophi, accumulate in synovium and adjacent joint structures, and may lead to locally destructive and compressive symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1612472706\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic CPP crystal arthritis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis (pseudo-RA) was applied to a nonerosive, inflammatory arthritis in which CPP crystals were demonstrable in joint fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This presentation of CPPD disease resembles RA in several respects, including the presence of significant morning stiffness, fatigue, synovial thickening, localized edema, and restricted joint motion due either to active inflammation or to flexion contracture.</p><p>Typically, the chronic inflammatory arthritis of CPPD disease involves multiple joints, frequently involving peripheral joints of the upper and lower extremities, including the wrists and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, as well as the knees and elbows, in a symmetric or nearly symmetric pattern. Articular inflammation may last up to several months, and inflammation in affected joints tends to wax and wane independently of one another, in distinction to RA, where synchronous flare and remission is the rule.</p><p>Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis occurs in 5 percent or less of patients with symptomatic CPPD disease. A rare subtype of chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis, occurring most often in older adult patients during an acute polyarticular attack, is characterized by prominent systemic features, such as leukocytosis, fever, and mental confusion, closely mimicking systemic sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In such patients, the delirium is reported to resolve with resolution of the acute polyarticular flare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteoarthritis with CPPD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is the most prevalent form of symptomatic CPPD disease; for example, 20 percent of unselected patients examined at total knee joint replacement for OA showed CPP crystals in synovial fluid samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of patients with symptomatic CPP crystal deposition disease show progressive joint degeneration, usually involving multiple joints. This pattern of disease has historically been referred to as &quot;pseudo-OA&quot; because of its resemblance to OA occurring in the absence of CPPD. In about one-half of such patients, episodes of acute inflammatory arthritis typical of pseudogout punctuate the course. In the remainder, joint degeneration proceeds by a process more typical of classical OA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most commonly affected joints in this form of CPPD disease are the knees, followed by the wrists, MCP joints, hips, shoulders, elbows, and spine. Although a symmetric pattern of joint involvement is frequent, unilateral or more severe degenerative change on one side is not unusual. Findings on clinical examination of individual joints do not typically differ from those observed in OA, which include asymmetric bony enlargement, tenderness, effusions, crepitus, and restricted joint motion. Patients with OA with CPPD may also exhibit contractures of involved joints and valgus deformities of the knees.</p><p>When the arthritic process occurs in joints typical for OA (such as the interphalangeal joints of the hands, the first carpometacarpal joints, the knees, or the bunion joints), even radiograph or joint fluid evidence of CPPD does not permit an unequivocal diagnosis. However, an etiologic or accelerating role for CPP crystal deposition in joint degeneration seems likely when radiographic calcification is present early in the course of degeneration, particularly if the degenerative changes also involve joints atypical for OA (wrists, MCP joints, elbows, and shoulders) in the absence of a preceding history of joint trauma or of vocational or avocational stress.</p><p>As cartilage is lost during the course of progressive joint degeneration, previously apparent cartilage calcification may become increasingly difficult or impossible to detect radiographically, thereby obscuring the diagnosis. The radiographic features of CPPD are described. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Imaging findings'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe joint degeneration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of reports have documented CPP crystal deposition in association with severe joint degeneration which closely resembles neuropathic arthropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Neuropathic arthropathy is characterized by severe joint degeneration and disruption occurring in the course of neurologic disorders leading to joint denervation; the affected joint is often called a Charcot joint. Underlying disorders associated with Charcot joints include diabetes mellitus (most common), tabes dorsalis, and syringomyelia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-neuropathic-arthropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic neuropathic arthropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to neuropathic arthropathy, neurologic function is typically normal in severe joint degeneration associated with CPP crystal deposition, prompting use of the term &quot;pseudo-neuropathic joint disease&quot; for this relationship, although an underlying neurologic impairment (typically tabes dorsalis) has, in some instances, been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The term &quot;pseudo-neuropathic&quot; is intended to convey the view that, when CPP crystal deposition is associated with certain neurologic deficits, the presence of crystals amplifies the destructive consequences of joint denervation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CPP crystal deposition in and about the spine has been associated with a number of clinical manifestations, including spine stiffness, sometimes associated with bony ankylosis, which can resemble the spinal changes of ankylosing spondylitis or diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). Such symptoms have been most commonly encountered in familial CPPD disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, crystal deposition in the ligamentum flavum at the cervical spine level or in the posterior longitudinal ligament at lower levels of the spine may lead to spinal cord compression syndromes or to symptoms either of acute nerve compression or of chronic spinal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p>The crowned dens syndrome (CDS) is a rare, but important to recognize, syndrome, which is characterized by severe acute or recurrent axial neck pain, neck and shoulder girdle stiffness, and associated fever; elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and CPP or calcium hydroxyapatite crystal deposition demonstrable on computed tomography [CT] in and around the atlanto-axial articulation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The importance of identification of the crystal deposition basis of CDS lies both in the resemblance of its symptoms and signs to those of polymyalgia rheumatica, giant cell arteritis, or, less frequently, meningitis, cervical discitis, or inflammatory spondyloarthritis; and in the usually favorable response of CDS clinical features to treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CPP crystal deposition occurring in the wake of trauma or prior surgery may result in localized inflammation or degeneration, most commonly in the knee or in the lower or lumbar spine. In addition, CPP crystal deposition in bursae, ligaments, and tendons may be sufficient to cause local nerve compression, as in the carpal tunnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SYNOVIAL FLUID FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most salient finding on synovial fluid analysis in calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal (CPP) deposition (CPPD) disease is the presence of positively birefringent CPP crystals by compensated polarized light microscopy. In inflamed joints during an attack of acute CPP crystal arthritis, phagocytosed crystals within polymorphonuclear leukocytes are virtually always present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55730\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55730 \">picture 1</a>). However, certain characteristics of CPP crystals and several technical factors may affect crystal detection.</p><p>Total synovial fluid leukocyte concentration in an acute attack is typically 15,000 to 30,000 per mm<sup>3</sup>, 90 percent of which are neutrophils. In chronically symptomatic joints, crystals are often found extracellularly and cell counts are typically lower.</p><p>The abundance of CPP crystals in the synovial fluid is generally related to the degree of clinically apparent inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; however, large discrepancies between these variables can occur. The proportion of intracellular crystals correlates roughly with the level of inflammation (as reflected clinically and by the synovial fluid neutrophil concentration).</p><p>CPP crystals differ from the needle-shaped, strongly and negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals in acute gouty arthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74417\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74417 \">picture 2</a>); CPP crystals are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More difficult to detect</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smaller (0.5 to 10 microns)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakly and positively birefringent or not birefringent at all</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More polymorphic with rod-shaped and cuboid crystals in addition to the usual rhomboidal form</p><p/><p>In some instances, CPP crystals are too small to be readily visualized; for example, CPP crystals are sometimes smaller than can be resolved even by 1000-fold magnification with the aid of phase contrast microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Patients with CPP crystals in a synovial fluid sample may also have the simultaneous presence of monosodium urate crystals.

Articular or fibrocartilage calcification may be an indication of an underlying, potentially treatable disorder for which screening tests may be valuable.

In addition, trauma, surgery, or severe medical illness may provoke acute attacks in both of these crystal-induced disorders. Despite these similarities, the joints most commonly involved in an acute episode differ between gout and pseudogout. The knee is affected in over 50 percent of all acute attacks of pseudogout, whereas the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint is more frequently involved in gout. The distinction between these conditions is made based upon identification of crystals under polarizing light microscopy that are characteristic of one or the other condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The broader differential diagnosis of an acute monoarthritis is discussed in detail separately; however, infection, trauma, bleeding, and other crystal-associated diseases (eg, gout) are among the important disorders to consider. These conditions can usually be distinguished from pseudogout by synovial fluid analysis and joint radiography, although the presence of CPP crystals in joint fluid does <strong>not</strong> exclude infection. Thus, Gram stain, as well as joint fluid and blood cultures, is generally necessary to exclude an infectious etiology.

In chronic CPPD inflammatory arthritis, the multiple inflamed joints typically flare independently of one another, unlike in RA, where multiple joints usually flare and improve in parallel. Radiographic changes in chronic CPPD inflammatory arthritis are more typical of osteoarthritis (OA) than RA, despite the pattern of clinical joint involvement suggestive of the latter disorder (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Imaging findings'</a> above). The diagnostic approach to adults with polyarticular joint pain is presented in detail elsewhere.

Generally, the identification of CPP crystals and radiographic changes typical of CPPD disease will help distinguish the disorders. However, unlike gout, which is negatively associated with RA (occurring less often together than would be predicted from the prevalence of each condition in the population), CPPD disease and RA appear to coexist about as frequently as would be expected from the individual prevalence of the two disorders. It is important to distinguish between the coexistence of RA and CPPD disease and the expression of one masquerading as the other because of the substantial difference in management between these conditions.

In addition to the atypical distribution, other features on examination which should alert the clinician to possible CPPD disease include contractures of involved joints and valgus deformities of the knees.

In hemochromatosis, the ferritin level may be falsely normal after bleeding, classically in women with heavy menses, anyone after an occult and slow gastrointestinal bleed, or in celiac disease with iron absorption problems. Additionally, when an elevated ferritin level is present as an acute phase reactant or in liver disease, it is helpful to have the iron study results available without having to redraw the patient's blood.</p><p/><p>A search for these associated metabolic conditions is particularly fruitful when CPPD is diagnosed at a young age. Familial forms of CPPD disease may also occur early in life.</p><p>Appropriate further evaluation should be undertaken if one or more of these values are abnormal. In patients over 60 years of age, serum magnesium and alkaline phosphatase determinations may be omitted because chronic hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatasia present earlier in life. Despite the value of establishing and treating the non-musculoskeletal system organ-specific abnormalities associated with the presence of some of the disorders associated with CPPD disease, the results of specific treatments directed at the respective associated disorders, such as reversal of the iron overload in hemochromatosis or the parathyroid hormone excess in hyperparathyroidism, have been ineffective in halting or reversing the crystal deposition disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2790002046\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H272267074\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CPPD disease is a disease of older adults, and radiographic surveys demonstrate an age-related increase in the prevalence of articular cartilage calcification. There is no major sex predominance, although attacks of acute CPP crystal arthritis (often termed pseudogout) occur more frequently in men, while osteoarthritis (OA) with CPP deposition is more common in women. (See <a href=\"#H56278115\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical spectrum of CPPD disease is broad, even though the majority of patients are probably asymptomatic. The range of presentations, named as proposed by a European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) task force (with alternative and traditional terms in parentheses) includes (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H272267074\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Asymptomatic CPPD disease (&quot;asymptomatic CPPD&quot;) (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic CPPD disease'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute CPP crystal arthritis (&quot;pseudogout&quot;) (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Acute CPP crystal arthritis'</a> above) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis (&quot;pseudo-RA&quot;) (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>OA with CPPD, with or without superimposed acute attacks (&quot;pseudo-OA&quot;) (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Osteoarthritis with CPPD'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe joint degeneration (pseudo-neuropathic joint disease) (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Severe joint degeneration'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spinal involvement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synovial fluid analysis in CPPD disease is characterized by the presence of weakly positively birefringent CPP crystals that may be detected by compensated polarized light microscopy. Phagocytosed crystals within polymorphonuclear leukocytes are virtually always present in inflamed joints during an acute attack of CPP crystal arthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55730\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55730 \">picture 1</a>). Examination of synovial fluid for CPP crystals should be carried out promptly after joint aspiration, because successful identification of the crystals diminishes as the time elapsed between joint aspiration and microscopic examination increases. The total synovial fluid leukocyte concentration is typically 15,000 to 30,000 per mm<sup>3</sup>, 90 percent of which are neutrophils. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Synovial fluid findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H65654764\" class=\"local\">'Synovial fluid analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain film radiographic calcium crystal deposition in fibrocartilage, in or hyaline or articular cartilage, called cartilage calcification (chondrocalcinosis), is a common accompaniment of symptomatic CPPD but frequently exists in asymptomatic individuals. CPP crystal deposits typically appear as punctate and linear radiodensities in cartilage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54821\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54821 \">image 1</a>) and, with lesser frequency, in ligaments, tendons, synovium, and joint capsules. Even in the absence of demonstrable cartilage calcification, CPP crystal deposition is often detectable in patients with degenerative changes in joints. Ultrasonographic findings that correlate with radiographic features of CPPD disease have also been described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66316\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66316 \">image 2</a>).

Establishing the diagnosis is largely based upon the demonstration of CPP crystals in tissue or synovial fluid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> upon radiographic evidence of the disease. Screening radiographs of other frequently involved joints should be obtained in all patients in whom the diagnosis is suspected but in whom radiographs of pertinent affected joints have not yielded a definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a diagnosis of CPPD disease may also have one of a number of associated disorders, including hemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatasia, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F65287\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65287 \">table 1</a>). Given these disease associations, patients diagnosed with CPP crystal deposition, even if asymptomatic and especially if less than 50 years of age, should undergo the following serum screening studies: calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, ferritin, iron, and transferrin.
