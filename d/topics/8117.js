Patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy have subtle cognitive deficits, often appear to be asymptomatic, and may only be detected with psychomotor or electrophysiologic testing. Patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy have signs and symptoms that can be detected clinically, without the use of psychomotor testing (though psychomotor testing may be helpful in evaluating patients with mild encephalopathy).</p><p>In addition to the clinical manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy, patients frequently have clinical manifestations of chronic liver disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335422231\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive findings in patients with hepatic encephalopathy vary from subtle deficits that are not apparent without specialized testing (minimal hepatic encephalopathy), to more overt findings, with impairments in attention, reaction time, and working memory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70740\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70740 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58163\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58163 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy may progress to hepatic coma. Neuromuscular impairments include bradykinesia, hyperreflexia, rigidity, myoclonus, and asterixis. </p><p>Disturbances in the diurnal sleep pattern (insomnia and hypersomnia) are common initial manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy and typically precede other mental status changes or neuromuscular symptoms. As hepatic encephalopathy progresses, patients may develop mood changes (euphoria or depression), disorientation, inappropriate behavior, somnolence, confusion, and unconsciousness.</p><p>Neuromuscular impairment in patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy includes bradykinesia, asterixis (flapping motions of outstretched, dorsiflexed hands), slurred speech, ataxia, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, and nystagmus. Less commonly, patients develop loss of reflexes, transient decerebrate posturing, and coma. </p><p>Focal neurologic deficits may also be present. In a report of 32 patients who had 46 episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, a focal neurologic sign was detected in eight patients (17 percent of the episodes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The most common was hemiplegia. None of the patients with focal neurologic signs had abnormal findings on computed tomography scan or cerebrospinal fluid examination. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was performed in five of the eight patients and was normal in all five. Similarly, five patients with focal neurologic signs underwent Doppler ultrasound of the neck and vessels. In all five, the Doppler imaging was normal. The focal neurologic deficits resolved completely in seven of eight surviving patients after six months of follow-up.</p><p>Patients with hepatic encephalopathy usually have advanced chronic liver disease and thus have many of the physical stigmata associated with severe hepatic dysfunction. Physical findings may include muscle wasting, jaundice, ascites, palmar erythema, edema, spider telangiectasias, and fetor hepaticus. Some of these findings (such as muscle wasting, spider telangiectasias, and palmar erythema) are usually absent in previously healthy patients with acute hepatic failure since their development requires a relatively longer period of hepatic dysfunction.

In addition, elevated ammonia levels may be seen in patients who do not have hepatic encephalopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57620\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57620 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>For patients with mild degrees of hepatic encephalopathy (minimal hepatic encephalopathy or grade I encephalopathy) in whom the diagnosis is unclear, psychometric and electrophysiologic tests may be helpful. In such patients, our approach is to first to ask about subtle signs of impaired mental status, and if signs point to the possible presence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy to perform psychometric testing (typically the number connection test) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90152\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef90152 \">algorithm 1</a>). An alternative but less sensitive test is the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;, section on 'Mini-Mental State Examination'</a>.) </p><p>For patients with more severe hepatic encephalopathy (grades III and IV), the Glasgow Coma Scale may be useful for further stratifying the severity of neurologic impairment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70740\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70740 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Patients should be asked about changes in their sleep patterns and in cognitive capacity (decreased attention span, impaired short term memory) leading to difficulties with normal daily activities. Patients should also be asked about impaired work performance and work- or driving-related accidents. Patients should also be examined for signs of neuromuscular dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H152814968\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ammonia is the best characterized neurotoxin that precipitates hepatic encephalopathy. However, an elevated serum ammonia concentration is not required to make the diagnosis and is not specific for hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, ammonia levels are influenced by factors such as how the blood sample is obtained and handled. Serum ammonia levels should <strong>not</strong> be used to screen for hepatic encephalopathy in patients who are asymptomatic or who have mental status changes in the absence of liver disease or a portal-systemic shunt. </p><p>Other routine laboratory tests should be obtained to exclude other causes of mental status changes (eg, hypoglycemia, uremia, electrolyte disturbances, and intoxication) and to look for conditions that may have precipitated the hepatic encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"#H335421073\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H343907868\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for precipitating causes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H152815085\"><span class=\"h3\">Ammonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gastrointestinal tract is the primary source of ammonia, which enters the circulation via the portal vein. Ammonia is produced by enterocytes from glutamine and by colonic bacterial catabolism of nitrogenous sources, such as ingested protein and secreted urea. The intact liver clears almost all of the portal vein ammonia, converting it into urea or glutamine and preventing entry into the systemic circulation. The increase in blood ammonia levels in advanced liver disease is a consequence of impaired liver function and of shunting of blood around the liver. Muscle wasting, a common occurrence in these patients, also may contribute since muscle is an important site for extrahepatic ammonia removal.</p><p>Whether to measure of the serum ammonia concentration in patients suspected of having hepatic encephalopathy remains controversial. While the venous and arterial ammonia levels correlate with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy, levels are inconsistently elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Measuring serum ammonia levels may be useful under certain conditions (eg, monitoring efficacy of ammonia lowering therapy), but is not required to make the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy or for the long-term follow-up of patients with advanced liver disease. The accuracy of ammonia determination is influenced by many factors (such as fist clenching, use of a tourniquet, and whether the sample was placed on ice). These factors should be considered when interpreting results. Furthermore, ammonia levels can be elevated in a variety of nonhepatic conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57620\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57620 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Venous ammonia concentration is not useful for screening for hepatic encephalopathy since levels vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, hepatic encephalopathy is only directly related to ammonia levels up to about a twofold increase above normal. Any further increase of ammonia concentration does not contribute to the further evolution of hepatic encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>As with the venous ammonia concentration, hepatic encephalopathy is only directly related to arterial ammonia concentration up to about a twofold increase above normal. Furthermore, the grade of hepatic encephalopathy is more closely related to the partial pressure of gaseous ammonia (pNH3) than the total arterial ammonia concentration, since gaseous ammonia readily enters the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The pNH3 can be calculated from the total ammonia and pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], though this is rarely done outside of clinical studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Postprandial ammonia levels may be more closely related to minimal hepatic encephalopathy than fasting levels. Thus, in clinical trials, ammonia is often measured after a standard meal (or glutamine load) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In one study, induced hyperammonemia was associated with a significant increase in daytime subjective sleepiness and changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) architecture of a subsequent sleep episode in patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H152815106\"><span class=\"h3\">Other potential markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum levels of 3-nitrotyrosine may be elevated in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy. One study found that using a cutoff of 14 nM, 3-nitrotyrosine was 93 percent sensitive and 89 percent specific for detecting minimal hepatic encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychometric tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commonly performed bedside tests are insufficiently sensitive to detect subtle changes in mental function. As a result, several psychometric tests have been evaluated that quantify the impairment of mental function in patients with mild stages of hepatic encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,29-32</a>]. These tests are more sensitive for the detection of minor deficits of mental function than conventional clinical assessment or an EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Several psychometric tests have been developed, but none is used routinely in clinical practice. Our approach is to use the number connection test if signs point to the possible presence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy.</p><p>The use of psychometric tests is limited because many are cumbersome and time consuming (up to two hours per session), their reliability is decreased by a learning effect when they are applied repeatedly, and there is poor correlation among the tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Another problem with psychometric tests is that they are nonspecific (ie, any alteration of brain function will result in abnormal test results). This is a particular problem in patients with alcoholic liver disease or Wilson disease since both are associated with central nervous system abnormalities. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H152815714\"><span class=\"h3\">Number connection test (Reitan Test)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequently used psychometric test is the number connection test (NCT or Reitan Test), which is easily administered and interpreted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83108\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83108 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83109\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83109 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30,31,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31,35</a>]. The NCT is a timed connect-the-numbers test. Patients without hepatic encephalopathy should finish the test in a number of seconds less than or equal to their age in years.

The PHES includes a line tracing test, digit symbol test, serial dotting test, and both parts of the NCT. It examines visual perception, visuospatial orientation, visual construction, motor speed and accuracy, concentration, attention, and memory. The test can be performed in 10 to 20 minutes at the bedside. Possible scores range from -18 to +6 points. </p><p>In one study, when a cutoff of &le;-4 points was used, the test had a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting mild hepatic encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A simplified version of the test consisting only of the digit symbol, serial dotting, and line tracing tests was found to be as accurate as the full PHES test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, a study comparing the PHES test with an EEG in 100 patients with cirrhosis found agreement in detection of minimal hepatic encephalopathy in only 73 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Lower lure responses, higher target responses, and shorter lure and target reaction times indicate good psychometric performance.<br/><br/>A study comparing ICT to a psychometric battery of tests in 136 patients estimated its sensitivity for minimal hepatic encephalopathy to be 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy had significantly higher ICT lures and lower targets compared with patients without minimal hepatic encephalopathy.

The simplest EEG assessment of hepatic encephalopathy is grading the degree of abnormality of the conventional EEG tracing. A more refined assessment can be accomplished with computer-assisted spectral analysis of the EEG, which permits variables in the EEG (such as the mean dominant EEG frequency and the power of a particular EEG rhythm) to be quantified. Minor changes in the dominant EEG frequency occur in mild hepatic encephalopathy. Spectral EEG analysis may improve the assessment of mild hepatic encephalopathy by decreasing inter-operator variability and providing reliable parameters correlated with mental status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>The bispectral index (BIS) monitor is a rapid bedside tool to monitor EEG activity.

A more sophisticated form of evoked responses is event-related responses, which require some form of intellectual function. A typical event-related response is the P300 peak after auditory stimuli. The P300 is extremely sensitive for detecting subtle changes of brain function and can be used to diagnose minimal hepatic encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Critical flicker frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinal glial cells are involved in ammonia detoxification by glutamine synthesis. In patients with liver failure, they exhibit morphological changes similar to those observed in brain astrocytes, suggesting that retinal gliopathy could serve as a marker of cerebral gliopathy in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. These observations provided the rationale for the development of a visual test (the critical <span class=\"nowrap\">flicker/fusion</span> frequency) for determining whether hepatic encephalopathy is present. Advantages of the test are that it is objective and it is not affected by the patient's age or <span class=\"nowrap\">education/literacy</span> level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. However, a meta-analysis suggests that it is only moderately sensitive for detecting minimal hepatic encephalopathy. The meta-analysis included nine studies with 622 patients and found that critical flicker frequency had a sensitivity for detecting minimal hepatic encephalopathy of 61 percent and a specificity of 79 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p>In an analysis of patients with cirrhosis and controls, critical flicker frequency differentiated patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy from those without hepatic encephalopathy.

To maintain osmotic equilibrium, the astrocytes lose osmolytes such as myoinositol (mI).

The measurement time per patient with this technique, including adjustments, was approximately five minutes. T1 changes in the brains of patients with hepatic encephalopathy were determined quantitatively with TAPIR in short, clinically relevant measurement times.
