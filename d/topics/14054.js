Adequate preoperative patient evaluation and preparation may improve patient satisfaction, as well as decrease complications, delays, cancellations, costs, and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H567536262\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENTS OF THE PROCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Components of the preanesthesia evaluation process include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical evaluation to identify comorbid conditions, allergies, and previous complications of anesthesia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management and optimization of medical diseases that affect perioperative risk</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative risk assessment to inform shared decisions on alternatives for care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creation of a plan for anesthesia and postoperative care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education of patients and families about expectations surrounding anesthesia care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtaining informed consent (see <a href=\"#H1161898707\" class=\"local\">'Consent and decision making'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of appropriateness for care in ambulatory surgical facilities or remote locations (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-anesthesia#H1016692191\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Patient selection'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing preoperative instructions regarding medication management and fasting (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-fasting-guidelines\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative fasting guidelines&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motivating patients to stop smoking, lose weight, or commit to other preventive care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meeting regulatory requirements</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2322988662\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF PREANESTHESIA EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most appropriate timing for preanesthesia evaluation depends upon the general health status of the patient, his or her relationship with other care providers, the degree of risk associated with the planned procedure, and the urgency of the procedure. Other patient factors (eg, language barrier, intellectual disability) may also enter into the decision on timing, method, and location of the evaluation. </p><p>Not all patients will benefit from the same approach to preanesthesia evaluation, and resources need to be matched with expected benefits. Healthy patients having low-risk procedures can usually be seen on the day of the procedure immediately before anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H1953510740\" class=\"local\">'Healthy patients'</a> below.) </p><p>High-risk patients or patients having high-risk procedures may require further work-up, time for medical interventions, and intensive planning well in advance of the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H38484949\" class=\"local\">'Conditions that increase perioperative risk'</a> below.)</p><p>Many centers have created guidelines for screening in order to triage patients for the timing and method of preanesthesia evaluation. Such screening optimally occurs as soon as a procedure is considered. Screening information can be completed by the patient or family <span class=\"nowrap\">member/guardian</span> in person (paper or electronic version), remotely via electronic health record tools, with web-based programs, or during a telephone interview. Suggested patient and procedure triage criteria are shown in tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114155\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114155 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114156\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114156 \">table 2</a>).

In effective preoperative medicine clinics, the anesthesiologist performs a comprehensive assessment, arranges for any necessary consultations for optimization, orders testing, and communicates with the anesthesia clinicians who will care for the patient. High-risk patients and patients who undergo high-risk procedures may benefit from having informed consent for anesthesia obtained in a preanesthesia clinic, without the time constraints of discussions on the day of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1161898707\" class=\"local\">'Consent and decision making'</a> below.) </p><p>Evaluation of high-risk patients in a preoperative clinic may reduce unnecessary testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], case cancellations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and delays on the day of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, perioperative medicine clinics provide opportunities for behavioral modification intervention (eg, smoking cessation) at a &quot;teachable moment&quot; when patients may be more receptive to change due to an upcoming surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3528130625\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Practice Advisory for Preanesthesia Evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] that the preanesthesia assessment should include, at a minimum, the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient interview</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A focused examination of the airway, lungs, and heart</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of pertinent medical records</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indicated preoperative tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consultations with specialists if necessary</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2651398280\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical history and review of systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical history includes the history of present illness, past surgical history, past and current medical conditions, tobacco and substance abuse, and past experiences and problems with anesthesia in the patient or family members. The medical history should also include the severity and stability of the medical conditions, current or recent exacerbations, and prior treatments or planned interventions. A prior history of difficulty with airway management, severe postoperative nausea and vomiting, or a patient or family history of malignant hyperthermia or pseudocholinesterase deficiency is sought. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A history of excessive sore throat after anesthesia, dental injury related to anesthesia, or &quot;requiring a small breathing tube&quot; with previous anesthetics may indicate difficulty with airway management. Records from previous anesthetics should be reviewed when possible and may assist with planning for airway management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114346 \">table 4</a>). </p><p>A review of systems, including a general run-through of all organ systems, is especially useful to uncover symptoms that may lead to establishment of previously undiagnosed conditions. A review of records, including notes from primary care clinicians or specialists, and test results can reveal issues the patient may not recall.</p><p>The patient's functional capacity or cardiorespiratory fitness may be the single best predictor of perioperative risk. The patient is commonly asked to name the most strenuous activity he or she does regularly, or has done most recently, and whether such activity causes chest pain, dyspnea, or claudication. The inability to climb two flights of stairs or walk four blocks predicts an increased risk of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications after major noncardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Self-reported functional capacity may be inaccurate; observing the patient climbing stairs, or assessment with a six-minute walk test can provide additional information if inaccurate self-reporting is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Initial preoperative evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"#H4259298840\" class=\"local\">'Functional status'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;, section on 'Exercise capacity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults#H13496651\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;, section on 'Six-minute walk test'</a>.)</p><p>Dyspnea is a common patient complaint that may be caused by a variety of disease states, including some that may confer increased perioperative risk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changes in management. In many cases, the etiology of dyspnea may be categorized as pulmonary or cardiovascular (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69322\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69322 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104817 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82700\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82700 \">table 6</a>). Clinical assessment and testing for patients with dyspnea are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with dyspnea&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1033925515\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia directed physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At a minimum, the preanesthetic examination includes measurement of vital signs (blood pressure [BP], heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation); height and weight measurements with body mass index calculation; cardiac, pulmonary, basic neurologic examinations; and an airway assessment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114346 \">table 4</a>).

Guidelines in the United Kingdom suggest that preoperative clinics do not need to measure BPs in patients being seen for elective procedures if they have documented BPs <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;160/100</span> mmHg in the referral letter from primary care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients often have anxiety-related elevated BPs during the preoperative visit even without a history of hypertension. In this setting, the BP should be repeated, medical records reviewed, or the patient asked about typical BP readings; if necessary, the patient can be asked to measure the BP at home and report the results. Ambulatory measurement of BP correlates with end-organ damage and predicts cerebrovascular and cardiovascular adverse events in the nonoperative setting significantly better than clinic measurements of BPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Patients should be assessed for loose, capped, damaged, missing, and artificial teeth, which are at increased risk for damage during airway management. Abnormalities should be documented and confirmed with the patient. </p><p>If regional anesthesia (ie, neuraxial <span class=\"nowrap\">anesthesia/analgesia,</span> peripheral nerve block) is planned or possible, the regional anesthesia site is examined to assess for potential difficulty or infection, and any preexisting neuropathy or weakness should be documented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3127648370\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of the patient's risks of anesthesia and the planned procedure is an important component of the preanesthesia evaluation.

Mortality rates vary widely across hospitals and countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worldwide an estimated 300 million operations are performed each year, and approximately one out of four patients who undergo major surgery will develop complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>]. Up to 2.5 million patients will die (1 percent risk) and 12.5 million will have costly adverse events each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/16,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19,20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of complications varies across procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] and patient populations. Patients at highest risk are those of advanced age with comorbid diseases having major surgery, with a hospital mortality rate as high as 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term survival is significantly reduced for those patients who have perioperative complications, even if they survive to leave the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The costs associated with complications after surgery are substantial.

An ASA-PS rating is assigned to every patient who undergoes anesthesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87504 \">table 7</a>). The ASA-PS was not designed to evaluate patient risks, but it is widely used for this purpose.</p><p>ASA-PS designation is subjective, and assignments vary widely among clinicians, especially when determined by non-anesthesiologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Nonetheless, a higher ASA-PS is associated with complications, increased cost, unexpected hospital admission after ambulatory surgery, postoperative admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), hospital length of stay, and mortality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113974\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113974 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/24,26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26-31</a>].</p><p>ASA-PS also correlates with the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114577\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114577 \">table 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/24,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,32</a>]. </p><p>The ASA-PS is a component of some more comprehensive tools for assigning perioperative risk. (See <a href=\"#H3214609715\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment tools'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4259298840\"><span class=\"h3\">Functional status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have shown that inability to perform average levels of exercise (4 to 5 metabolic equivalents [METs]) identifies patients at risk of perioperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/11,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,33</a>]. Functional capacity reflects the integrated responses of the pulmonary, cardiovascular, circulatory, neuromuscular, and hematologic systems and muscle metabolism. The assessment can range from a self-reported ability to engage in activities of daily living, to six-minute walk tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>], to objective testing of oxygen uptake with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

Biomarkers are more highly predictive of major adverse cardiac events than for other complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Elevated preoperative and postoperative plasma levels of CRP are associated with postoperative delirium, suggesting that a pre-inflammatory state and inflammatory response to surgery may be mechanisms of delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2810882344\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, intraperitoneal or intraabdominal, intrathoracic, and major vascular procedures, as well as longer procedures, those associated with greater blood loss and intraoperative fluid shifts, and emergency procedures are associated with higher perioperative risk. Laparoscopic, endovascular, orthopedic, peripheral procedures, and breast surgery usually carry lower risks. </p><p>For several guidelines and perioperative risk assessment tools, surgical risk has been defined according to risk of death or major adverse event, with high risk arbitrarily defined as having a greater than 5 percent risk of complications, intermediate risk as 1 to 5 percent risk, and low risk as less than 1 percent risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>However, there are broad variations of surgical risk within these categories. This concept was illustrated by a study that used data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database to determine the risk of perioperative adverse cardiac events (PACE), defined as cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation or acute myocardial infarction, for three million operations that occurred between 2010 and 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There was a continuum of risk across over 1800 operations analyzed, and significant differences in risk among operations within traditionally designated low, intermediate, and high risk categories. As an example, there was a threefold difference in risk of PACE between laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy and Whipple procedure, both of which are considered high risk according to the Revised Cardiac Risk Index. This risk stratification model requires external validation, and may require institution specific modification for application. Examples of the risk of PACE for selected common operations as determined by this model are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F116645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116645 \">table 9</a>).</p><p>Surgical risk for specific postoperative outcomes (eg, cardiac complications versus pulmonary complications) are not equivalent. More accurate assessment of surgical risk is best accomplished by using computer- or web-based calculators of risk such as ACS NSQIP calculator to accurately define the procedure and data-supported risk assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>The only well-established very low-risk procedure is cataract extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. If the patient is able to lie relatively flat, stay still, follow simple commands, and local anesthesia is planned, then there are few if any contraindications for cataract surgery. There is a probably small, irreducible risk of unfavorable outcomes after cataract surgery, given the population of older adult individuals who often have advanced diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3214609715\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk assessment tools</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of tools have been developed that combine patient and surgical factors to improve the accuracy of prediction of perioperative risk. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <a href=\"https://riskcalculator.facs.org/RiskCalculator/&amp;token=6gVWib8LYMmb6itGH0wlY/f2oHJ5SEnQyuGi9bDrAXFrx3/rruaA8hzokn1sqFdO&amp;TOPIC_ID=94539\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ACS NSQIP calculator</a> is a free of charge online resource for overall risk assessment that combines procedure-specific surgical risk with 20 patient factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

For most patients, we agree with the Joint Guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland and the British Hypertension Society on the preoperative measurement and management of hypertension, which state that primary care practices should aim to control BPs to <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;160/100</span> before referral for elective surgery, but that if BPs are not known then surgery can proceed in patients with measurements &lt;180 mmHg systolic and 110 mmHg diastolic in the preoperative clinic or on the day of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The decision to delay surgery for BP optimization or institute new antihypertensive treatment must be individualized, based on patient factors and the urgency of surgery. Regardless of BP on the day of surgery, if patients have taken their BP medications, are asymptomatic, and there is evidence that the patient's BPs before the day of surgery are usually <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;160/100,</span> then proceeding with planned anesthesia is acceptable. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most antihypertensive agents can be continued up to and including the day of surgery, with the possible exception of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).
