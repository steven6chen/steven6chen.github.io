Amblyopia is most responsive to treatment when initiated before age seven years, and the upper age limit for optimal therapy is considered to be in the range of 9 to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. Although it is optimal to begin therapy in early childhood, we agree with the American Academy of Ophthalmology's recommendation to attempt treatment in all children with previously untreated amblyopia, regardless of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Approximately half of older children (7 to 17 years) with previously untreated amblyopia respond to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Similarly, significant refractive error must be corrected with glasses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> contact lenses in children with amblyopia due to a refractive error. Patching the better-seeing eye in the treatment of amblyopia is of little benefit if the amblyopic eye remains unable to focus clearly because of uncorrected refractive error.

Such patients may be treated initially with glasses alone and are followed up in three to four months. If amblyopia persists, patching or pharmacologic penalization is started. (See <a href=\"#H178705695\" class=\"local\">'Patching'</a> below and <a href=\"#H178706120\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic penalization (atropine)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178705613\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of amblyopic eye</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children with strabismic amblyopia and those with severe (ie, visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/100</span> or worse) refractive amblyopia, correction of refractive errors alone is generally not sufficient treatment. The child must be encouraged to use the amblyopic eye. This is accomplished by discouraging use of the better-seeing eye with a patch (occlusion) or cycloplegic eye drops (penalization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. A 2014 systematic review that included three randomized trials concluded that the combination of refractive correction plus <span class=\"nowrap\">occlusion/penalization</span> was more effective than refractive correction alone for the treatment of strabismic amblyopia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178705695\"><span class=\"h3\">Patching</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occlusion therapy involves patching the eye with better vision. Close-range visual activities (eg, arts and crafts activities, board games, reading, writing) during patching are commonly used to encourage use of the amblyopic eye; however, the benefit of near activities is unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>The prescribed duration of patching varies from two hours to all waking hours per day, depending upon the age of the child (younger children generally require less occlusion than do older children), the cause and severity of the amblyopia (severe amblyopia usually requires more intensive patching than does mild to moderate amblyopia), and the preferences of the treating specialist and parents. For most patients with mild to moderate amblyopia, treatment can be initiated with two hours of daily patching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. If no improvement is achieved at the first or second follow-up visit, the patching dose is increased to four to six hours per day or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H178706658\" class=\"local\">'Residual amblyopia'</a> below.)</p><p>In a randomized controlled trial comparing two hours of daily patching to glasses alone (if needed) in 180 children with strabismic and anisometropic amblyopia, visual acuity (measured with the Snellen chart) improved to a greater degree after five weeks of patching (average improvement of 1.1 lines) compared with glasses alone (average improvement of 0.5 lines) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective study of 246 children with strabismic (68 percent) and anisometropic (32 percent) amblyopia treated with occlusion therapy, successful outcomes (linear acuity <span class=\"nowrap\">6/12</span> or better) were achieved in 85 percent of the children with strabismic amblyopia and 100 percent of those with anisometropia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Factors correlated with unsuccessful outcome included poor visual acuity at the start of treatment, more than one diopter of anisometropia, hypermetropia of more than three diopters, and poor or only fair compliance with the treatment plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Neither age at presentation nor age at start of treatment correlated with outcome in this study. However, other studies have shown better results with early referral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/7,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25</a>].</p><p>Clinical trials evaluating different durations of patching (eg, 6 versus 24 hours, 2 versus 6 hours) in children with severe and moderate amblyopia have found similar improvements regardless of the prescribed duration of patching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/14,23,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23,26-28</a>]. One reason for this may be that patches are worn for fewer hours than they are prescribed. In a study in which adherence with prescribed patching was objectively monitored, the patch was actually worn 4.2 and 6.2 hours per day in children for whom it was prescribed for 6 and 12 hours, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The major disadvantage to occlusion therapy is compliance. Many children resist wearing the patch. They may remove it or peel it back enough to allow peeking. Both of these measures may render treatment less effective or completely ineffective. Adherence to the treatment plan is more likely in younger children and is a critical factor in outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/24,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,30,31</a>]. In addition, clear communication, including written instructions for parents and pictures for children, improves compliance with patching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation#H13655384\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amblyopia in children: Classification, screening, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Information for patients'</a>.)</p><p>Supervised inpatient occlusion treatment has been shown to be beneficial in the United Kingdom, but it is impractical and not practiced in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Suturing or gluing the occluder in place also have been used to increase adherence with occlusion therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], but the long-term effects of these strategies have not been assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Other more feasible strategies to encourage compliance include, for example, allowing the child to play a favorite video game or watch television only when the patch is worn. </p><p>Children undergoing patching therapy are at risk for developing occlusion amblyopia in the fellow eye, and it is therefore important to monitor visual acuity in both eyes at each visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Based upon the results of the Amblyopia Treatment Studies demonstrating that fewer hours of patching were as effective as full-time patching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>], many ophthalmologists prescribe fewer hours per day of patching, and as a result, occlusion amblyopia is much less frequent than it previously was. Fear of occlusion amblyopia may cause some parents to limit patching or avoid it altogether; however, it is important to recognize that it occurs rarely and is almost always reversible. Occlusion amblyopia is not necessarily a reason to curtail or discontinue treatment unless the drop in visual acuity worsens on subsequent visits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178706120\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacologic penalization (atropine)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visual blurring, through the use of a cycloplegic agent in the sound eye, temporarily handicaps the sound eye, thus encouraging use of the amblyopic eye. Pharmacologic penalization is not effective for patients with myopia.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Atropine</a> is the cycloplegic agent used most commonly, but other agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=homatropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">homatropine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">scopolamine</a>) are used by some ophthalmologists. In our practice, when pharmacologic penalization is prescribed, we typically use atropine (1% ophthalmic solution, one drop to the sound eye once a day on weekends or daily) for children &ge;2 years and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclopentolate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclopentolate</a> (1% ophthalmic solution, one drop to the sound eye once a day on weekends or daily) for children &lt;2 years. However, we generally prefer patching over pharmacologic penalization in children &lt;2 years because the risk of systemic side effects with cycloplegic agents (as described below) is likely higher in this age group.

Other cycloplegic agents, all of which are anticholinergic agents, have similar side effects. In a large clinical trial, side effects were reported in 26 percent of patients treated with atropine drops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The most common adverse effects were light sensitivity (18 percent) and conjunctival irritation (4 percent).

In a large multicenter randomized trial comparing atropine with patching (for a minimum of six hours per day) in 419 young children with moderate amblyopia, visual acuity in the amblyopic eye (measured with the Snellen chart) improved after six months of treatment by three lines in similar proportions of both groups (79 percent of the patching group and 74 percent of the atropine group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In follow-up studies, no differences were observed in visual acuity of amblyopic and fellow eyes at 10 and 15 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/3,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,44</a>]. Visual acuity in the amblyopic eye was maintained at <span class=\"nowrap\">20/25</span> or better in 60 percent of patients at age 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Different schedules of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atropine</a> are used.

Approximately one-quarter of the patients responded (ie, &ge;2-line improvement in visual acuity in the amblyopic eye) with visual correction alone.

The response rate was similar in both groups among children aged 13 to 17 years; however, among the treated children in this age group, the response rate was greater in those who had never been treated for amblyopia than in those who had (47 versus 20 percent). Most patients, including those who responded to treatment, had residual deficits in visual acuity. For this reason, many older children will reasonably decline treatment, unless the parents and child are unusually motivated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the amblyopia has not been previously treated. In addition, the rate of recurrence after treatment in late childhood is unknown.</p><p>Although these data provide encouraging evidence that it is possible to effectively treat amblyopia in late childhood, they should not de-emphasize the need to identify and treat children with amblyopia as early as possible.
