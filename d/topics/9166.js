It decreases insomnia and has positive effects on mood and quality of life. The absorption and bioavailability are independent of dose (in contrast to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, with which bioavailability decreases with increasing doses). The maximal plasma concentration and the area under the curve are proportional to dose. Steady-state concentrations are achieved in one to two days after repeated dosing. Pregabalin does not affect urine flow or cause urinary retention.</p><p>The median time to onset of sustained improvement is four days with a dose of 600 mg a day, five days with 300 mg a day, 13 days with 150 mg a day, and 60 days with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-19-pain-and-dysesthesias-of-the-lower-extremities-in-a-29-year-old-woman-with-type-1-diabetes-distal-sensory-neuropathy-b2/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Doses above 300 mg a day are not recommended.</p><p>Adverse effects include angioedema and other hypersensitivity reactions, dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, peripheral edema, blurred vision, weight gain, and difficulty with concentration. Rarely, as with other antiepileptic agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> may cause suicidal thoughts or behavior or changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>The choice of agent for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy is often governed by the comorbidities and relative contraindications present. In this patient with symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> is preferable to a tricyclic. The favorable safety profile in this patient justifies the increased cost of this agent.</p><p>The management of the patients in this case is discussed further in the comment card.
