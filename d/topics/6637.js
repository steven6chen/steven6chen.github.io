Normal development of communication requires the interaction of an intact mechanism with a favorable environment. The components of an intact mechanism include hearing sensitivity, perception, intelligence, structural integrity, motor skill, and emotional stability. A favorable environment is one that provides the child with adequate language exposure and stimulation, reinforces the child's communicative attempts, and holds realistic expectations according to the child's developmental stage.</p><p>Developmental language disorder is the most common developmental disability of childhood, occurring in 5 to 10 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Children learn language in early childhood; later they use language to learn. Children with language disorders are at increased risk for difficulty with reading and written language when they enter school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. These problems often persist through adolescence or adulthood. Early intervention may help minimize the more serious consequences of later learning disabilities.

It may involve the form (grammar, syntax, morphology), content (vocabulary), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function (pragmatic use) of language [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The etiology of speech and language impairment is reviewed here. The evaluation and treatment of these disorders are discussed elsewhere.

However, most children with disordered articulation and phonology do not exhibit an identifiable physical reason for the problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Hearing impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with hearing impairments have difficulty with all parameters of speech, not just articulation. These speech problems result from a limited ability to hear others and to monitor their own speech production. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-loss-in-children-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing loss in children: Etiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing impairment in children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurologic problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysarthrias are speech problems caused by neuromuscular impairment resulting from a stroke, brain tumor, or disorder of the nervous system (eg, cerebral palsy). Dysarthria often is associated with a swallowing disorder (eg, dysphagia) because the same structures are employed for both speaking and swallowing. Long before the child begins speaking, dysphagia may be identified by choking or coughing with feedings; inability to handle secretions; nasal regurgitation; and recurrent upper respiratory infections, pneumonia, and congestion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal oral feeding difficulties due to sucking and swallowing disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Apraxia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An impairment in the ability to program the speech musculature to select, plan, organize, and initiate a motor pattern is called apraxia. It is presumed to be neurologic in origin; however, the validity of considering developmental apraxia of speech or developmental verbal dyspraxia as a separate diagnostic category is one of the most controversial issues in clinical speech pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Structural defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cleft lip and palate, ankyloglossia (tongue tie), and complete or partial glossectomy also impair articulation. The tongue tip must be able to move freely to produce sounds such as <span class=\"nowrap\">/t/,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">/d/,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">/n/,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">/l/,</span> but misarticulation caused by ankyloglossia is quite rare. Tongue size appears to have little relationship to articulation, but this variable has not been investigated thoroughly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The term &quot;tongue thrust&quot; refers to excessive anterior tongue movement during swallowing or speech. It may be associated with malocclusion and articulation difficulty, usually a frontal lisp characterized by anterior tongue placement for <span class=\"nowrap\">/s/</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">/z/</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluency disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Developmental stuttering usually begins between the ages of two and five years. Although the etiology of stuttering is not completely understood, stuttering is more common in males and has a high familial incidence. Incidence and twin studies suggest that an interaction between genetic and environmental factors leads to stuttering in predisposed individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Theories of developmental stuttering have included organic, behavioral, and psychologic causes. The capacities-and-demands model proposes that stuttering develops when the capacities of the child for fluency (eg, motor skills, language production skills, emotional maturity, cognitive development) are not equal to the demands of the environment for speech performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>By comparison, neurogenic stuttering is associated with neurologic disease or trauma. It is much less common than is developmental stuttering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Voice disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Voice disorders are related to misuse or organic changes of the vocal mechanism. Vocal quality also can be affected by hearing loss because of difficulty in self-monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Causes of voice disorders in children include contact ulcers, vocal nodules, vocal polyps, cancer, endocrine changes, granuloma, hemangioma, hyperkeratosis, infectious laryngitis, laryngofissure, leukoplakia, papilloma, vocal fold paralysis, and webbing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Vocal nodules, which occur more frequently in children than in adults, are the most frequently occurring laryngeal pathology encountered by speech-language pathologists working in schools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Most voice problems, including those related to vocal nodules, are caused by the use of excessive effort and force while speaking. This vocal behavior may be part of an overall pattern of hyperactivity in the preschool years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common causes of hoarseness in children&quot;, section on 'Nodules'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Resonance disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypernasality and hyponasality characterize resonance disorders. Hypernasality results from clefts of the hard or soft palate, submucous clefts, inadequate length of the velum (muscular portion of the soft palate), and paralysis or paresis of the velum. These types of structural defects prevent normal closure between the soft palate, or velum, and the pharyngeal wall, thereby allowing air to escape into the nasal cavity (ie, velopharyngeal insufficiency [VPI]). VPI may be masked by the child's use of excessive force and tension to compensate for the structural weakness, resulting in a hoarse vocal quality. The opposite condition, hyponasal resonance or denasality, can be caused by enlarged adenoids, nasal polyps, and improper velar timing. In this disorder, the child sounds congested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">LANGUAGE DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, language disorder is characterized by [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language (expressive or receptive) across modalities (ie, spoken, written, sign language, or other) due to deficits in comprehension or production that include reduced vocabulary, limited sentence structure, and impairments in discourse (ability to use vocabulary and connect sentences)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Language abilities substantially and quantifiably below those expected for age, resulting in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, academic achievement, or occupational performance</p><p/><p>In addition, the difficulties must have onset in the early developmental period and must not be attributable to hearing or other sensory impairment, motor dysfunction, or another medical or neurologic condition, including intellectual disability or global developmental delay.</p><p>Common features include slow rate of language development, a limited amount of speech, limited range of vocabulary, difficulty acquiring new words, word-finding vocabulary errors, shortened sentences, simplified grammatical structure, limited varieties of sentence types, use of unusual word order, formulation difficulty, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> difficulty understanding words, sentences, or specific types of sentences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Major categories</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Developmental language impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Developmental language impairment (DLI) or disorder (DLD) is a broad term used to describe a variety of developmental disorders, including those associated with cognitive impairment, in which speech and language also are affected. DLI must be distinguished from specific language impairment (SLI), described below, because of important differences in the approach to treatment and prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Specific language impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLI is a developmental disorder that occurs in the absence of intellectual disability (mental retardation), hearing loss, motor disorder, socioemotional dysfunction, or frank neurologic deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Genetic factors are thought to contribute to poor language development in children who do not have other developmental or sensory disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Case-control studies have identified various risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Risk factors that have been identified in more than one study include family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/19,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21-23</a>], male sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/19,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,22</a>], lower education levels of parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/21,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23,24</a>], lower paternal occupational status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/19,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,22</a>], and more siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>].</p><p>The strong familial incidence of language and learning problems in the near relatives of children with SLI indicates a probable genetic component to this disorder. Genetic mapping has been difficult, as most families with speech and language deficits show complex patterns of inheritance. The study of three generations of one family with severe speech and language disorder transmitted as an autosomal dominant monogenic trait identified the involvement of the <em>FOXP2</em> gene on chromosome 7q31 in the development of speech and language [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Other loci involved in SLI have been mapped to chromosomes 16q and 19q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many conditions are associated with language disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75946\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75946 \">table 1</a>).

Fluid in the middle ear can impair the transmission of sound, causing a mild conductive hearing loss. Although a relationship between otitis media and <span class=\"nowrap\">speech/language</span> development has been suggested by several studies, the nature of the linkage remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/30-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-38</a>].

However, a stronger, more consistent correlation was found between socioeconomic index (eg, maternal education and health insurance status) and language and cognitive skills at age three, raising the possibility that socioeconomic index is a marker for a confounding factor that predisposes children to both otitis media and developmental impairment in the first year of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a longitudinal study, differences were found in phonologic processing and working memory between groups of nine-year-olds with and without history of otitis media in the first year of life, indicating that subtle, long-term effects of early otitis media can be detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Neglect and abuse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Language problems are significantly affected by the quality of the child-mother interaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].
