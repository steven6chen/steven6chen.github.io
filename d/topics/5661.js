In subsequent studies, <em>SCN1A</em> mutations have been identified in approximately 70 to 80 percent of patients with DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p>More than 700 mutations, randomly distributed along the <em>SCN1A</em> gene, have been identified. The most common genomic abnormalities are truncating mutations (40 percent), missense mutations (40 percent), nonsense mutations, and splice site changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some patients who test negative for <em>SCN1A</em> abnormalities on sequencing are found to have exonic deletions or chromosomal rearrangements involving the same gene. Rare duplications and amplifications affecting the <em>SCN1A</em> gene have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13-16</a>].</p><p>Approximately 90 percent of mutations arise de novo. Familial or germline mutations, usually missense in nature, account for approximately 5 to 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17-19</a>]. Parental mosaicism has been identified in up to two-thirds of familial cases and likely accounts for unaffected or mildly affected parental phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p><em>SCN1A</em> mutations have also been identified in patients with genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], as well as in infants with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The determinants of this broad phenotypic spectrum are not fully understood and may be related to the type and location of the genetic mutation as well as the presence of yet-to-be-determined modifier genes.

The majority of these patients remain without a molecular diagnosis, and other genes are likely to be implicated.</p><p>Additional genes that have been identified in patients with a DS phenotype include <em>PCDH19,</em> <em>SCN1B, GABRA1</em>, <em>STXBP1</em>, <em>CHD2</em>, <em>SCN2A</em>, and rarely, <em>HCN1</em>, <em>KCNA2, </em>and<em> GABRG2</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-33</a>]. Notably, <em>PCDH19</em> seems to account for approximately 5 percent of all patients with DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4128872834\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotype-phenotype correlations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consistent genotype-phenotype correlations have not been firmly established in DS, although data are evolving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,34-36</a>]. In general, it is not possible to predict an individual's phenotype based solely on the specific <em>SCN1A </em>mutation.</p><p>Truncating mutations, by definition, are expected to lead to premature termination of protein translation, leading to haploinsufficiency. Therefore, virtually all <em>SCN1A</em> truncating mutations result in a DS phenotype. Compared with missense mutations, truncating mutations have been associated with earlier age at the onset of myoclonic seizures (16 versus 19 months), atypical absence seizures (17 versus 27 months), [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] and an increased rate of cognitive decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>By contrast, clinically significant missense mutations in <em>SCN1A</em> are likely to be located within the four conserved homologous domains (D1 to D4), which represent the main ion transport sequence of the neuronal sodium channel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109735\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109735 \">figure 1</a>). Each of these domains consists of six transmembrane segments, S1 to S6. Missense mutations appear to occur most frequently in segment S4, which accounts for most of the gating charge of the voltage sensor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39,40</a>], and S6, which forms the inner pore lining the sodium channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. One recurrent missense mutation has been reported in a small number of patients in association with a particularly severe phenotype of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Nonsense mutations or mutations affecting the pore-forming region of the sodium channel appear to associate closely with gait deterioration, specifically crouched gait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Despite these observations, there can be remarkable variability in epilepsy severity and clinical phenotype among family members harboring the same mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,43-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,43-47</a>]. Proposed mechanisms to explain this variability include modifier genes such as <em>SCN9A</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], genetic background, environmental factors, and somatic or germline mosaicism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3150226351\"><span class=\"h2\">Interneuron hypothesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons has been proposed as a pathophysiologic mechanism in DS.</p><p>In mouse models, the protein product of the <em>SCN1A</em> gene (Nav1.1) is the primary voltage-gated sodium channel in several classes of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Nav1.1 is specifically located in cell bodies and dendrites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Impairment of Nav1.1 channels results in loss of firing of GABAergic neurons and consequent disinhibition of selected neural circuits.</p><p>Haploinsufficiency of Nav1.1 as a result of mutations in <em>SCN1A</em>, leading to dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons, is therefore hypothesized to be the underlying mechanism of epilepsy, as well as comorbid ataxia, in DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3857984062\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of DS evolve over time. Core features include refractory epilepsy characterized by multiple different seizure types, neurodevelopmental delay and neurologic disability that begin after seizure onset, and cognitive and motor system dysfunction persisting into adulthood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F112854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112854 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2399939286\"><span class=\"h2\">Birth to one year of age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizure onset occurs within the first year of life, usually between five and eight months, in a previously healthy infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,58,59</a>]. In rare cases, seizures begin during the second year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. As a rule, infants with DS have had normal physical and psychomotor development at the time of their first seizure. </p><p>The typical initial seizure is a febrile tonic-clonic seizure, which may be either unilateral (hemiclonic) or bilateral. The most common initial seizure precipitants are <span class=\"nowrap\">fever/illness</span> (58 percent), immunization within the preceding 48 hours (7 percent), and bathing (2 percent); in 33 percent of patients, no precipitants can be identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Seizures are often prolonged, lasting more than 10 to 15 minutes, sometimes evolving into status epilepticus.</p><p>Uncommonly, patients present initially with myoclonic or dyscognitive seizures. Some patients experience focal myoclonic jerks, which may or may not be recognized as epileptic in origin, days or weeks prior to the first convulsive seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,62</a>].</p><p>Since electroencephalogram (EEG) and the initial basic workup are usually normal (see <a href=\"#H1127200179\" class=\"local\">'Electroencephalography'</a> below), the first seizure is often classified as a complex febrile seizure. The neurologic examination and brain imaging are typically normal. Many patients have relatives with mild forms of epilepsy or a history of simple febrile seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,62,63</a>].</p><p>The prolonged duration of the first seizure may be the first clue of a more severe neurologic disorder. In most patients with DS, febrile and or afebrile seizures, including episodes of status epilepticus, recur repeatedly in the weeks to months after the initial event, despite antiseizure drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Psychomotor impairment is initially observed in the months following the first seizure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2579087653\"><span class=\"h2\">One to five years of age</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2334708283\"><span class=\"h3\">Seizure characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Young children with DS have a multitude of seizure types, which as a rule are refractory to antiseizure treatment. Patients characteristically have a low epileptic threshold to both external and internal stimuli, especially during the early childhood years. Common stimuli include <span class=\"nowrap\">fever/hyperthermia,</span> emotional stress or excitement, flashing lights, and contrasting lights and visual patterns.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Convulsive seizures</strong> &ndash; Convulsive seizures are present in virtually all patients and tend to persist throughout the lifespan. Seizures may be generalized tonic-clonic, generalized clonic, and alternating hemiclonic. They may be prolonged and evolve into status epilepticus. Importantly, generalized seizures can be either generalized at onset or secondarily generalized, with a focal onset that is brief and easily missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hemiclonic seizures can affect either side in the same patient. This alternating pattern is somewhat characteristic of DS and can be helpful diagnostically. Postictally, patients usually have asymmetric EEG signs and may have temporary paralysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myoclonus and myoclonic seizures</strong> &ndash; Myoclonus, both epileptic and nonepileptic, occurs frequently in patients with DS. Myoclonus can be segmental, multifocal, or generalized. Consciousness is preserved during the events, except in the context of multiple consecutive seizures or long clusters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/62,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,64,65</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Body distribution &ndash; Myoclonic seizures may involve the axial muscles only, at times manifesting as rhythmic movements referred to as &quot;head nodding.&quot; Myoclonic seizures may involve only the arms and shoulders. Others may become generalized, massive myoclonic jerks. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Temporal distribution &ndash; Myoclonic seizures may be isolated or they may occur in brief clusters of two or three myoclonic jerks. They may evolve into long runs of repeated myoclonic jerks for several seconds or into convulsive seizures. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Triggers &ndash; Myoclonic seizures can be spontaneous or triggered by photic stimulation, eye closure, variation in light intensity, or fixation on patterns. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On EEG, epileptic myoclonus is usually associated with fast polyspikes with a generalized distribution but higher in amplitude over the frontocentral regions. Consecutive runs of myoclonic jerks can be associated with repeated fast polyspikes or spike and wave discharges with generalized distribution, and bifronto-central predominance; at times, a stable 3 Hz or higher frequency can be observed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absence seizures</strong> &ndash; Most patients with DS have atypical absence seizures manifested by abrupt impairment of consciousness, usually lasting 3 to 10 seconds, with or without a myoclonic component involving the head, eyelids, and sometimes the arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,66</a>]. EEG during these events shows slow generalized spike waves with a frequency &le;3 Hz. Typical absence seizures with generalized spike-wave discharges at 3 Hz or higher occur rarely in patients with DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-absence-epilepsy#H6941749\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood absence epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Seizure semiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Absence status epilepticus can occur, characterized by progressive impairment of consciousness with fluctuating intensity, without motor phenomena. EEG during absence status shows discontinuous sequences of slow polyspike or spike-wave discharges that fluctuate in intensity and are diffusely distributed but with an anterior predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obtundation status</strong> &ndash; Obtundation status is a subtype of nonconvulsive status epilepticus that consists of varying degrees of long-lasting impairment of consciousness (obtundation) along with segmental, erratic myoclonia affecting limbs and face. Recurrent massive myoclonic jerks may be interspersed. Convulsive seizures can potentially initiate, terminate, or even occur during these events. Obtundation status can last from a few hours up to several days and may be temporarily interrupted by strong sensory stimuli.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The EEG during obtundation status typically shows diffuse slow waves, intermixed with focal as well as diffuse spikes, sharp waves, and spike-wave discharges, of higher voltage in the anterior regions and the vertex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,64,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,64,66,67</a>]. There is no time correspondence between the spikes and the myoclonic jerks except during some of the massive myoclonic jerks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Focal seizures</strong> &ndash; Focal seizures can appear at any time from four months to four years of age. Both focal motor seizures and dyscognitive seizures may be seen, and any type of focal seizure may secondarily generalize.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Focal motor seizures in patients with DS can be characterized by versive or clonic movements limited to an extremity or hemiface, whereas focal dyscognitive seizures consist of impairment of consciousness and prominent autonomic phenomena (pallor, cyanosis, respiratory changes, drooling, sweating), as well as oral automatisms, hypotonia, and sometimes eyelid or distal myoclonus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The EEG during dyscognitive seizures usually shows rhythmic fast polyspikes followed by theta activity towards the end of the seizure. Ictal onset can be seen anywhere in the cortex, but frequently involves the temporo-parieto-occipital region of one hemisphere or, less frequently, one of the frontal regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tonic seizures</strong> &ndash; Tonic seizures are infrequent in children with DS. They have variable electroclinical features but are somewhat similar to the axial tonic seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), occasionally with an additional myoclonic component.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ictal EEG generally shows either a flattening of the background activity of short duration (two to three seconds) or a rapid, diffusely distributed recruiting rhythm, at times interrupted by a flattening, followed by slow waves or irregular diffuse spike-wave discharges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,66,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,66,68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3728704582\"><span class=\"h3\">Focal neurologic signs and developmental delay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic signs gradually appear throughout this stage.

Patients start to walk at a normal age but then develop an unsteady gait shortly thereafter. Language also tends to emerge at an appropriate age but then progresses slowly, to the extent that many patients fail to reach the stage of constructing elementary sentences. Fine motor abilities do not develop well.</p><p>This arrest of development is most evident up to five or six years of age, resulting in cognitive impairment of variable degrees, after which there seems to be a general trend towards stabilization (plateauing phase), but no significant recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].

These observations, in addition to the fact that <em>PCDH19</em>-related epilepsy affects mainly females, may be used to clinically distinguish these two syndromes. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3921656529\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

It accounts for less than 5 percent of cases of epilepsy presenting in the first year of life. (See <a href=\"#H2599047275\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel alpha-1 (<em>SCN1A</em>) gene are identified in 70 to 80 percent of patients with DS. (See <a href=\"#H2015874668\" class=\"local\">'Genetics and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common presenting symptom is a hemiclonic or generalized seizure, often precipitated by fever, in an otherwise healthy infant between five and eight months of age. Early seizures tend to be prolonged and recurrent, and may evolve into status epilepticus. Neurodevelopmental decline typically begins shortly after seizure onset. (See <a href=\"#H2399939286\" class=\"local\">'Birth to one year of age'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between one and five years of age, patients with DS have refractory epilepsy characterized by multiple types of seizures, both febrile and afebrile, including convulsive seizures, myoclonic seizures, atypical absence seizures, and focal seizures. Neurologic signs include hypotonia, ataxia, pyramidal signs, myoclonus, and behavioral disturbances. (See <a href=\"#H2579087653\" class=\"local\">'One to five years of age'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older children and adults with DS tend to have improved seizure control but persistent, moderate to severe intellectual disability and motor system abnormalities, including crouch gait, antecollis, and other parkinsonian features. There is an increased risk of premature mortality due primarily to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and status epilepticus. (See <a href=\"#H687406093\" class=\"local\">'Five years of age to adulthood'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1778983703\" class=\"local\">'Increased mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) is often normal at the time of seizure onset but gradually evolves to show slowed background activity and interictal epileptiform abnormalities, including generalized spike and wave discharges, polyspike waves, and focal or multifocal discharges. (See <a href=\"#H184035489\" class=\"local\">'Interictal EEG findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DS is a clinical diagnosis, based on a combination of clinical and EEG features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F112854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112854 \">table 1</a>). Genetic testing is recommended but not required for diagnosis. Genetic testing enables early identification of the disease, influences treatment selection, and facilitates access to adjuvant therapies and patient and family support networks. (See <a href=\"#H2970074179\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of DS varies depending on the phase of the disease and includes febrile seizures, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Doose syndrome, progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME), severe infantile multifocal epilepsy (SIMFE), and <em>PCDH19</em>-related epilepsy. (See <a href=\"#H1004483128\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Dravet C.
