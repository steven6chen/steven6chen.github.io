Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is the most common renal side effect of lithium therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The predominant form of chronic renal disease associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> therapy is a chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although the majority of studies show infrequent and relatively mild renal insufficiency attributable to lithium therapy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to lithium-associated chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy does occur in a small percentage of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/3,5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-8</a>]. Relatively less is known about potential glomerular toxicity of lithium, particularly the nephrotic syndrome. Additional kidney manifestations of lithium exposure include renal tubular acidosis and hypercalcemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lithium poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normally, water permeability of principal cells in the collecting tubule is regulated by antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Aquaporin-2 water channels (AQP2), which normally reside in the endosomes of principal cells, move to and fuse with the luminal membrane under the influence of ADH, thereby allowing water to be reabsorbed down the favorable concentration gradient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema#H96014898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;, section on 'Regulation of plasma tonicity'</a>.)</p><p>Chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> ingestion can lead to resistance to ADH, resulting in polyuria and polydipsia in up to 20 to 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. Lithium enters the principal cells of the collecting duct through epithelial sodium channels in the luminal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. It then accumulates in these cells and interferes with the ability of ADH to increase water permeability. Several possible mechanisms may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/2,9,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,11-14</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> may increase expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and therefore increase urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion by medullary interstitial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These prostaglandins then act on principal cells to induce lysosomal degradation of AQP2 water channels and a decline in urine concentrating ability:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> may reduce <em>AQP2</em> gene transcription, an effect that is prostaglandin independent, leading to a further decrease in concentrating ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> induces collecting duct remodeling characterized by a decreased population of principal cells relative to the number of intercalated cells, a phenomenon that was previously presumed to be due to apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. However, lithium may actually lead to proliferation of principal cells, which then undergo cell cycle arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This may also be responsible for the development of interstitial nephritis and renal fibrosis.</p><p/><p>With chronic use in humans, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) often becomes irreversible. In one study, patients who had been on the drug for more than 18 years invariably had an irreversible defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Acute onset of nocturia is an important clue to the presence of NDI. The urine is normally most concentrated in the morning due to lack of fluid ingestion overnight; as a result, the first manifestation of a loss of concentrating ability is often nocturia.</p><p>It should not be assumed that polyuria in a patient taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> is due to NDI. Both central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and primary polydipsia have also been described in patients treated with lithium; they may be induced by lithium or reflect underlying psychiatric disease, particularly the use of psychotropic medications, which induce a dry mouth, thereby stimulating thirst and producing a picture of primary polydipsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/4,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16,17</a>].</p><p>Thus, a water restriction test may be helpful in establishing the correct diagnosis since the treatment of these disorders is different.

When lithium-induced NDI is diagnosed, the following measures should be instituted. These modalities are most effective if the diagnosis is made before a severe concentrating defect has occurred:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> should be discontinued, if possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those patients in whom <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> therapy is absolutely necessary despite its renal toxicity, we recommend the concomitant use of the potassium-sparing diuretic, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a>.</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiloride</a> inhibits the epithelial sodium channels in collecting tubule cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60693 \">figure 1</a>) and therefore should minimize further accumulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> (if lithium therapy is continued). The following data support the use of amiloride in patients with NDI who continue to use lithium:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiloride</a> was given to nine patients who continued to take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> despite the development of NDI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. After three to four weeks of therapy, mean urine volume fell significantly (from 4.7 to 3.1 liters per day), and urine osmolality increased significantly (from 228 to 331 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosm/kg)</span>. This effect persisted for at least six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a placebo-controlled crossover study, 11 patients with lithium-induced NDI were treated with 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> or placebo in random order for six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Amiloride therapy significantly increased the responsiveness of the urine osmolality to exogenous arginine vasopressin (165 percent increase in urine osmolality); no change in responsiveness to arginine vasopressin was seen with placebo.</p><p/><p>However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> is likely to be effective only when there is a mild to moderate concentrating defect that is potentially reversible. The experience with amiloride has been disappointing in patients with severe disease (maximum urine osmolality below 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span>. In these patients, the tubular damage is often permanent, even if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/4,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19</a>]; as a result, diminishing lithium entry into the collecting tubular cells cannot improve concentrating ability.</p><p>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> therapy is given, serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> concentrations must be carefully monitored since diuretic-induced volume depletion may increase proximal sodium and lithium reabsorption. The ensuing fall in lithium excretion may then require a reduction in drug dose.</p><p>Other therapeutic options to manage polyuria in lithium-induced NDI are similar to those in other causes of NDI: a thiazide diuretic (to diminish distal water delivery or upregulate aquaporin receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]) and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID; to decrease the synthesis of prostaglandins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another well-accepted regimen is the use of the combination of low-sodium diet and thiazide diuretics. Thiazides decrease urine volume and increase urine osmolality by producing a state of mild sodium depletion; this reduces distal tubule delivery of sodium and increases fractional water reabsorption in the collecting duct. As with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a>, serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> concentrations <strong>must</strong> be closely monitored after initiation of therapy with a thiazide diuretic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since most patients have only partial resistance to ADH, it is also possible that attaining supraphysiologic levels of ADH (by administering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> [1-deamino,8-D arginine-vasopressin; dDAVP]) will attenuate the polyuria. The likelihood of success may be increased by combining dDAVP with an NSAID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. NSAID therapy alone also may be effective in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of hypernatremia and its complications is also considerable in these patients. This is particularly true in settings in which fluid intake is curtailed, during an acute illness, or when inadequate fluid resuscitation is given in those undergoing surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL TUBULAR ACIDOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tubular defect in the distal nephron can also impair the ability to maximally acidify the urine. This is most often manifested as the incomplete form of type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis, in which the urine pH is persistently above 5.3 but the extracellular pH and bicarbonate concentration are within the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Most cases are due to minimal change disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], but focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/6,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,26</a>]. The mechanism by which lithium leads to glomerular injury is not completely understood, but the course is highly suggestive of an etiologic role for lithium (ie, epithelial toxicity). Proteinuria generally begins within 1.5 to 10 months after the onset of therapy and, in minimal change disease, completely or partially resolves in most patients one to four weeks after lithium is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In several patients, reinstitution of lithium led to recurrent nephrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Corticosteroids have occasionally been required to induce remission; it is possible that the minimal change disease in such cases was unrelated to lithium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The relationship to FSGS is less clear. In three patients, for example, cessation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> did not lead to resolution of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], suggesting either no relation to lithium or possible secondary FSGS due to tubular injury induced by chronic lithium therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis of secondary FSGS'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Edema during the manic phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, lithium-treated patients become edematous in the absence of overt renal, hepatic, or cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. How this occurs is not well understood, but two factors may contribute: a marked increase in sodium intake that may be induced in part by mania and perhaps a lithium-induced reduction in maximum sodium excretory capacity that is of no importance when sodium intake is relatively normal. Affected patients present with the unusual combination of edema plus high rates of urinary sodium excretion that can exceed 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> concentrations may also fall below the therapeutic range at this time due to enhanced urinary lithium excretion. Volume expansion appropriately decreases the proximal reabsorption of sodium; lithium reabsorption also falls since it is reabsorbed via the same transporters as sodium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS AND KIDNEY FUNCTION IMPAIRMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> use is associated with chronic kidney disease that occasionally progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-toxicity-of-lithium/abstract/6-8,30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,30-34</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 20 to 40 percent of patients who chronically take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> develop polyuria and polydipsia. In such patients, a water restriction test should be performed to establish the presence of NDI since patients with bipolar illness may also develop central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and primary polydipsia. NDI appears to result from lithium accumulation in collecting tubule cells, which interferes with the ability of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to increase water permeability. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who develop NDI, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> therapy should be discontinued, if possible. However, for those patients in whom lithium therapy is absolutely necessary despite its renal effects, concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> therapy to minimize lithium accumulation in collecting tubule cells is recommended. Amiloride is likely to be effective only when there is a mild to moderate concentrating defect that is potentially reversible. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy of the polyuria in lithium-induced disease is similar to that in other causes of NDI: a thiazide diuretic (to diminish distal water delivery or upregulate aquaporin receptors), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID; to decrease the synthesis of prostaglandins) provided renal function is preserved, and a low-sodium diet. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since most patients have only partial resistance to ADH, it is also possible that attaining supraphysiologic levels of ADH (by administering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> [1-deamino,8-D arginine-vasopressin; dDAVP]) will attenuate the polyuria. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> use is associated with the insidious onset of chronic kidney disease due to chronic interstitial nephritis in up to 15 to 20 percent of patients. Major risk factors for nephrotoxicity appear to be the duration of lithium exposure, the cumulative dose, and advanced age. The degree of renal insufficiency is generally relatively mild but may occasionally progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Chronic interstitial nephritis and kidney function impairment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The course of the renal disease after discontinuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> is unpredictable. There may be some recovery of renal function, particularly with correction of hypovolemia. However, progression of chronic kidney disease can occur. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Chronic interstitial nephritis and kidney function impairment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> may lead to hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, and hypocalciuria. Discontinuation of lithium therapy does not always lead to normalization of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium levels; thus, surgical parathyroidectomy is a common option in such patients. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cinacalcet</a>, a calcimimetic, may also reduce PTH levels and a return the serum calcium to normal, thereby averting the need for surgical treatment.
