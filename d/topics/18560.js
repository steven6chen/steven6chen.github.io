Clinical symptoms vary widely depending upon the type and location of the vessels involved and the extent of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Because of the multisystem nature of these disorders, many pediatric subspecialties, including rheumatology, dermatology, nephrology, pulmonology, and cardiology, may be involved in the diagnostic workup and ongoing care of a child with vasculitis.</p><p>Although most types of primary vasculitis in childhood are rare, with an estimated incidence of 20.4 per 100,000 children below 17 years of age, prompt recognition and treatment of these disorders are important as these can be severe and life-threatening conditions without appropriate management.</p><p>The approach to evaluating a child with suspected vasculitis is reviewed here. The classification and overview of the management of childhood vasculitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Classification and incidence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-management-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Management overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of primary vasculitis is challenging because the clinical presentation of childhood vasculitis varies widely depending upon the type and location of the vessels involved, the extent of inflammation, and subsequent vessel wall damage with associated hemodynamic changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71389\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71389 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Many patients ultimately diagnosed with a specific vasculitis will have presented initially with a combination of fever or other constitutional symptoms, skin lesions, and laboratory evidence of inflammation. These early findings are neither specific nor sensitive for vasculitis and may be found in other conditions including common infections. In patients with such nonspecific systemic symptoms, vasculitis should be strongly considered if symptoms do not resolve as would be expected in a &quot;self-limited&quot; infectious illness. In addition to systemic symptoms, the presence of multiorgan involvement should heighten one's suspicion of vasculitis.</p><p>In some cases, certain combinations of clinical features or patterns of organ involvement are suggestive of, and sometimes sufficient for the diagnosis of, a specific vasculitis (pattern or syndrome recognition). As an example, the combination of lower-extremity purpura, abdominal pain, joint pain, and glomerulonephritis would suggest the diagnosis of Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura (immunoglobulin A [IgA] vasculitis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63367\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63367 \">picture 1</a>), whereas the syndrome of persistent fever, conjunctivitis, rash, mucocutaneous changes, and swelling of the hands and feet would suggest the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78898\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78898 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68321\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68321 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59319\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59319 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72040\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72040 \">picture 5</a>).

Their clinical features have been well described in children. The other chronic idiopathic vasculitides (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener's], polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis, Takayasu arteritis) are relatively rare in childhood. Although typical characteristics and clinical &quot;syndromes&quot; have been described for adults with these vasculitides, the presentation in children may not be so &quot;typical,&quot; and the diagnostic process often requires consideration of a wider differential diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIATING PRIMARY VASCULITIS FROM OTHER DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the initial evaluation of a child with suspected vasculitis, it is critical to distinguish primary vasculitis from other diseases that can either mimic vasculitis or cause secondary vasculitis. Because of the rarity of the primary vasculitides, when patients with overt, recognizable vasculitis syndromes have been excluded, a patient with clinical features &quot;suggestive&quot; of vasculitis is more likely to have another disease.

Nonspecific complaints (ie, fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and arthralgias) are generally present early in the course of the disease, irrespective of the size of the involved vessels (as discussed above).

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Classification and incidence&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For children with clinical features highly suggestive of systemic vasculitis (and who do not have Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura [IgA vasculitis], Kawasaki disease, or another overtly recognizable vasculitis syndrome), it remains paramount to rule out other diseases as these are still much more likely than a primary vasculitis. Systemic diseases that mimic vasculitis or cause secondary vasculitis may have significant morbidity and mortality and require timely and appropriate treatment. In addition, other diseases that are not primary vasculitides may be less likely to require invasive biopsies for diagnostic confirmation.</p><p>Although each type of vasculitis may be described as having a characteristic pattern of organ involvement, children do not always present in this classic manner nor do they necessarily present with the same degree or extent of vascular involvement as adults with primary vasculitis. This was illustrated in reviews of two pediatric rheumatology registries from the early 1990s, which reported that up to two-thirds of children with chronic primary vasculitis did not fulfill diagnostic classification criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-evaluation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In a survey of pediatric rheumatologists from the United States and Canada performed in 2005, clinicians reported that one-third of patients were categorized as having &quot;unclassified vasculitis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Hence, the diagnostic process in a child suspected of having vasculitis may require consideration of a wide differential diagnosis. Further evaluation requiring imaging or histologic review of tissue samples from involved organs may be necessary to make a more definitive diagnosis, especially in children with severe disease who may require therapy that has potentially serious adverse effects.</p><p>The variability of clinical manifestations of the primary vasculitic disorders precludes a single, uniform approach. However, assessment is helped by having knowledge of the basic common clinical features of vasculitis, familiarizing oneself with the specific vasculitic disorders and their manifestations, and being aware of the other diseases that mimic vasculitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation includes a detailed history, comprehensive physical examination, and basic laboratory testing for all children and adolescents suspected of having vasculitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constitutional symptoms, such as malaise, fatigue, and fever, are frequently present; however, they are nonspecific.

The presence of coronary aneurysms with some other clinical features may be diagnostic of Kawasaki disease, although other vasculitides (such as polyarteritis nodosa), infections (Epstein-Barr virus), and inflammatory disorders (systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis) also may cause coronary artery dilatation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Large- and medium-sized vessel abnormalities may be detected by Doppler ultrasound, CT <span class=\"nowrap\">angiogram/magnetic</span> resonance arteriography (MRA), and conventional angiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65987\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65987 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">MRA of the aorta and great vessels, including some major branches, such as the coronaries and renal arteries, may be an alternative to contrast arteriography in children. When the two techniques were compared in 10 children with various vascular lesions (age range: 1 month to 16 years), excellent correlation was found between the images (r = 0.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-evaluation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. For conditions involving smaller vessels, conventional angiography remains the preferred imaging modality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear, nose, and throat studies &ndash; Sinus radiographs, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful to evaluate suspected sinus disease that is commonly seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Bronchoscopy or upper-airway imaging studies may be needed to evaluate upper-airway symptoms suggestive of subglottic stenosis seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Tissue biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gold standard for definitive diagnosis of a vasculitis remains histopathologic evidence of vascular inflammation. A tissue biopsy may be necessary if the diagnosis cannot be made on the basis of syndrome recognition with or without imaging studies. If the affected organ is easily accessible, such as the skin, the procedure is relatively minor and poses minimal risk to the patient. In the case of kidney involvement, there is a higher biopsy-associated risk but also a high diagnostic yield, and the information obtained about disease activity, extent, severity, and ultimately prognosis is valuable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-evaluation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Some biopsies, such as nasal or transbronchial lung biopsy, have very low diagnostic yields. Other organs may be less accessible, such as the brain or the lungs. In this setting, the risk of doing the biopsy plus the potential diagnostic yield must be weighed against the risks of administrating a potentially long-term toxic treatment in a patient without diagnostic confirmation of a specific vasculitis. Such cases will need to be evaluated on their individual merits in consultation with experts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3286677682\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Vasculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasculitis is defined as the presence of inflammation in a blood vessel, which may occur as a primary process or secondary to an underlying disease. Prompt recognition and treatment of these disorders are important as they can be severe and life-threatening conditions without appropriate treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of vasculitis should be considered in children and adolescents who present with persisting systemic symptoms and evidence of multiorgan dysfunction. Clinical symptoms vary widely depending upon the types and location of vessels involved, the extent of inflammation, and the degree to which vascular integrity has been compromised.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In some cases, the initial presentation is restricted to a rash and nonspecific constitutional signs and symptoms, including fever, weight loss, weakness, or fatigue, which may be difficult to distinguish from findings seen in children with other disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71389\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71389 \">table 1</a>). However, in the majority of cases, a particular combination of findings or pattern of organ involvement (pattern or syndrome recognition) are indicative and sometimes sufficient to diagnosis a specific vasculitis, such as Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura (immunoglobulin A [IgA] vasculitis) or Kawasaki disease, the two most common causes of primary vasculitis in childhood. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary vasculitides are commonly classified and differentiated according to vessel size. Although, early in the course of the disease, nonspecific complaints (ie, fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and arthralgias) are generally present irrespective of the size of the involved vessels, over time and with further evaluation, some clinical features may correlate with the size and location of vessel involvement. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical correlation with vessel size'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Classification and incidence&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with other disorders, including those associated with secondary vasculitis, can present with symptoms and findings similar to those with a primary vasculitis. A combination of clinical, pathologic, immunologic, and radiologic features will generally distinguish a primary vasculitis from other conditions including noninflammatory conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69111\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69111 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Differentiating primary vasculitis from other disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of any child suspected of having vasculitis includes a detailed history, comprehensive physical examination, and basic laboratory testing. The goal is to both support a diagnosis of vasculitis and to exclude other, more common conditions that may present similarly. In most cases, the diagnosis of a primary vasculitis is made based upon clinical findings and pattern recognition of the characteristic findings associated with the specific disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the diagnosis of a specific vasculitis is not clear after the initial assessment, additional investigations including imaging and tissue biopsy are used to differentiate vasculitis from other conditions and to determine the specific vasculitic disorder.
