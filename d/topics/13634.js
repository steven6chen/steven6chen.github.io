As a result, adequate uptake of glucose from the plasma is essential for normal brain function and survival. Given the survival value of maintenance of the plasma glucose concentration, it is not surprising that very effective physiological and behavioral mechanisms that normally prevent or rapidly correct hypoglycemia have evolved. As a result, hypoglycemia is an uncommon clinical event except in patients who use drugs that lower glucose levels, particularly those with diabetes who use insulin, a sulfonylurea, or a glinide. In addition to being at increased risk for hypoglycemia, diabetic patients treated with insulin often have impaired neurohumoral responses to and few early symptoms of low blood glucose concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>This topic card will review glucose metabolism and the response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and in patients with diabetes. The therapeutic approach to hypoglycemia in diabetic patients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hypoglycemia during treatment of diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">REGULATION OF GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal subjects, the extracellular supply of glucose is carefully regulated primarily by insulin and glucagon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67404\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67404 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. As plasma glucose concentrations rise after a meal, glucose enters the pancreatic beta-cells. In the cells, the enzyme glucokinase, which phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, may act as the glucose sensor, initiating a sequence of events leading to entry of calcium and insulin release. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-beta-cell-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic beta cell function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Insulin acts to restore normoglycemia primarily through the following two mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It decreases hepatic glucose production by diminishing both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. It does so directly and indirectly by diminishing delivery of the gluconeogenic precursors, lactate and alanine, among other amino acids, and glycerol to the liver via its antiglycolytic, antiproteolytic, and antilipolytic actions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It increases glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and adipose tissue by translocating glucose transporters from an intracellular pool to the cell surface.</p><p/><p>Insulin also inhibits glucagon secretion by direct inhibition of the glucagon gene in the pancreatic alpha-cells, which further diminishes hepatic glucose production. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-action#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulin action&quot;, section on 'Insulin and glucose metabolism'</a>.)</p><p>The net effect of these responses is inhibition of hepatic glucose production and increased peripheral utilization of the glucose load that is not taken up by the liver. As a result, plasma glucose concentrations normally return to baseline values within several hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPONSE TO HYPOGLYCEMIA IN NORMAL SUBJECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the fasting state, when glucose cannot be obtained from the intestinal absorption of food, glucose counterregulatory mechanisms prevent or rapidly correct falling plasma glucose concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67404\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67404 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75618\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75618 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. There is a hierarchy among the defense mechanisms, and in non-diabetic individuals the glycemic thresholds for activation of these defenses are reproducible. The counterregulatory hormonal responses begin well before the onset of symptoms of hypoglycemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Counterregulatory hormones</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first defense is a decrease in insulin secretion as plasma glucose concentrations decline within the physiological range (starting at an arterialized venous plasma glucose threshold of 80 to 85 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [4.4 to 4.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second defense is an increase in glucagon secretion. Glucagon acts only on the liver, increasing glucose production by stimulating both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis from alanine, among other amino acids, and glycerol. A normally functioning liver is necessary for an adequate response to glucagon. The glycemic threshold for glucagon is 65 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.6 to 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third defense is an increase in epinephrine secretion. Acting via beta-2-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine has similar hepatic effects as glucagon. It also increases the delivery of gluconeogenic substrates from the periphery, inhibits glucose utilization by several tissues and, via alpha-2-receptors, inhibits insulin secretion. As with glucagon, a normally functioning liver is necessary for an adequate response. The glycemic threshold for epinephrine secretion is also 65 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.6 to 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortisol and growth hormone contribute only if the hypoglycemia persists for several hours. These hormones limit glucose utilization and enhance hepatic glucose production.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Relation between insulin and glucagon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the earliest stages (within minutes) of a hypoglycemic episode, decreased insulin is the most important regulatory hormone response and increased glucagon is the most important counterregulatory hormone response. The secretion of glucagon and insulin are closely coupled, both anatomically and physiologically.</p><p>Insulin, perhaps among other beta-cell secretory products, normally restrains glucagon secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], an effect that is lost in insulin deficient diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-beta-cell-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic beta cell function&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral defenses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial symptoms of sweating, anxiety, palpitations, hunger, and tremor occur as the plasma glucose concentration falls below 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. These symptoms trigger the important behavioral defense, ie, the ingestion of food. They are signaled largely by increased sympathetic neural activity.</p><p>Hypoglycemia can also cause cognitive dysfunction, which occurs in normal subjects at plasma glucose concentrations below 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Cognitive dysfunction can impair behavioral defenses. More severe neurologic symptoms, including obtundation, seizures, and coma, occur with progressive hypoglycemia. Profound and prolonged hypoglycemia can cause brain death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPONSE TO HYPOGLYCEMIA IN DIABETES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Impairment of behavioral and counterregulatory responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoglycemia in insulin or insulin secretagogue treated patients with diabetes is typically the result of the interplay of absolute or relative therapeutic insulin excess and compromised physiological and behavioral defenses against falling plasma glucose concentrations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The protective response to hypoglycemia is impaired in many diabetic patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75618\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75618 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1-3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,6</a>]. The first defense, the ability to suppress insulin release, cannot occur in patients with absolute beta-cell failure, ie, those with type 1 diabetes and long-standing type 2 diabetes. Therefore, inhibition of hepatic glucose production continues. Thus, the main defense against hypoglycemia is increased release of counterregulatory hormones (glucagon and epinephrine), which raise plasma glucose concentrations by stimulating glucose production and by antagonizing the insulin-induced increase in glucose utilization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucagon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The glucagon response to hypoglycemia, although normal at the onset of diabetes, is lost in parallel with that of insulin in type 1 diabetes and more slowly in type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1-3,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,6-8</a>]. This may be the result of beta-cell failure and subsequent loss of the hypoglycemia-induced decline in intraislet insulin that normally signals increased glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,10</a>]. Such patients still have some glucagon responses to other stimuli such as amino acids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Epinephrine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of absent insulin and glucagon responses, patients are dependent upon epinephrine to protect against hypoglycemia. However, the epinephrine response to hypoglycemia also becomes attenuated in many patients, at least in part because of recent antecedent hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2,7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7,11</a>]. An attenuated epinephrine response causes defective glucose counterregulation, which is associated with a 25-fold or greater increased risk of severe hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. An attenuated sympathoadrenal (largely sympathetic neural) response causes hypoglycemia unawareness, which is associated with a six-fold increased risk of severe hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concept of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) in type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and long-standing (absolute endogenous insulin deficient) type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] posits that recent antecedent iatrogenic hypoglycemia causes both defective glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia unawareness and thus a vicious cycle of recurrent hypoglycemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51847\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51847 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>]. It does so by shifting the glycemic threshold for the sympathoadrenal response to subsequent hypoglycemia to a lower plasma glucose concentration. This shift causes defective glucose counterregulation by reducing epinephrine responses in the setting of absent insulin and glucagon responses at a given level of hypoglycemia. It also causes hypoglycemia unawareness by reducing neurogenic symptom responses. Sleep and prior exercise can cause a similar phenomenon&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The precise mechanism(s) of the key feature of HAAF, the attenuated sympathoadrenal response to falling plasma glucose concentrations, is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>]. One hypothesis is that hypoglycemia-induced alterations in hypothalamic functions, or even a cerebral network, reduce the sympathoadrenal response to subsequent hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Another is that an increase in cortisol (or some other factor) during hypoglycemia causes a reduced sympathoadrenal response to subsequent hypoglycemia.</p><p>HAAF is a functional disorder distinct from classical diabetic autonomic neuropathy, the result of nerve fiber loss. Nonetheless, sympathoadrenal responses to a given level of hypoglycemia are reduced further in patients with autonomic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Type 1 versus type 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it was originally developed in type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], the concept of HAAF also applies to type 2 diabetic patients treated with intensive <span class=\"nowrap\">(basal/bolus)</span> insulin regimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75618\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75618 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Insulin secretion decreases progressively over time in type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As patients with type 2 diabetes develop absolute insulin deficiency and are treated with exogenous insulin, insulin secretion does not decrease and glucagon secretion does not increase when plasma glucose concentrations fall. Furthermore, antecedent hypoglycemia reduces the sympathoadrenal responses to subsequent falling glucose levels in type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Compared with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], the features of HAAF develop later in the natural history of type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8</a>]. This different temporal pattern of the pathophysiology of glucose counterregulation likely explains why iatrogenic hypoglycemia is relatively uncommon early in the course of type 2 diabetes (even during treatment with insulin), when the glucoregulatory defenses are intact, but occurs more frequently as patients approach the insulin deficient end of the spectrum of type 2 diabetes, when the defenses become compromised.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Nocturnal hypoglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most episodes of severe hypoglycemia occur during sleep. Nocturnal hypoglycemia is frequent even with the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or a basal-bolus regimen with insulin analogues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Overnight is typically the longest interprandial period and time between self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and the time of maximal sensitivity to insulin. Furthermore, sympathoadrenal responses to hypoglycemia are reduced during sleep and, therefore, people with diabetes are less likely to be awakened by symptoms of hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. As discussed earlier, even asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia impairs defenses against subsequent hypoglycemia.</p><p>The notion that nocturnal hypoglycemia causes hyperglycemia the following morning (the Somogyi hypothesis) has been discredited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The opposite is typically found, namely, a direct relation between the overnight blood glucose nadir and the following morning blood glucose value, ie, patients with morning hyperglycemia typically have high, not low, blood glucose concentrations at night. The most common causes of morning hyperglycemia are nocturnal growth hormone secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] and hypoinsulinemia.</p><p>Strategies to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia and the best solution for morning hyperglycemia are discussed separately.

In addition, as noted earlier, exercise, like hypoglycemia, can cause HAAF hours later (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51847\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51847 \">algorithm 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Hypoglycemia can be prevented by frequent SMBG and, when indicated, reduced insulin doses, carbohydrate ingestion, or both prior to exercise.
