A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the lumbosacral plexus, the most common causes of LSP, and the most currently accepted diagnostic approaches is needed to manage these conditions effectively.</p><p>Other neuropathies affecting the lower limbs are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lumbar and sacral plexuses make up the collective lumbosacral plexus which is formed from the anterior (ventral) rami of the L1 through S4 nerve roots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75983\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75983 \">figure 1</a>). The anterior rami divide within the plexus into anterior and posterior divisions that in turn yield individual peripheral nerves.</p><p>The lumbar plexus is derived from the anterior rami of the L1 through L4 nerve roots. These rami pass downward and laterally along the psoas major muscle where they eventually form the plexus. While within the psoas, they divide into anterior and posterior branches. The posterior branches of anterior rami, L2-L4, become the femoral nerve, which exits from the lateral aspect of the psoas, traveling through the iliacus and under the inguinal ligament to the anterior thigh. The anterior branches become the obturator nerve, which exits from the medial aspect of the psoas, and courses over the sacral ala through the obturator foramen to the medial thigh. The lumbar plexus also gives off the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve of the thigh, iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, and genitofemoral nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The lumbar plexus and sacral plexus are united via the lumbosacral trunk, which is comprised of a portion of L4 nerve root anterior rami, and all L5 anterior rami. The lumbosacral trunk passes over the sacral ala and joins the anterior rami of the S1-4 nerve roots to complete the sacral plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The sacral plexus drapes the posterolateral wall of the pelvis and converges upon the sciatic notch. These anterior rami also divide into anterior and posterior branches. The posterior branches of the lumbosacral trunk and S1 and S2 anterior rami form the lateral or peroneal division of the sciatic nerve. The anterior branches form the medial or tibial division of the sciatic nerve. The sacral plexus also gives off the inferior and superior gluteal nerves, posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh, and pudendal nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The lumbosacral plexus has a rich vascular supply. It is fed by the five lumbar arteries that originate from the abdominal aorta, the deep circumflex iliac artery that branches from the external iliac artery, and the iliolumbar and gluteal branches of the internal iliac artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumbosacral plexopathies have a multitude of clinical features. They most often present with asymmetric, focal weakness, numbness, dysesthesia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paresthesia in multiple contiguous lumbosacral nerve root distributions.</p><p>Patterns of weakness usually help localize the &quot;lesion&quot; to a more specific area within the plexus.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar plexus lesions tend to cause weakness of hip flexion and adduction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> knee extension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbosacral trunk and upper sacral plexus lesions result in foot drop or flail foot depending on the extent of involvement, and weakness of knee flexion or hip abduction.</p><p/><p>Patterns of sensory disturbance are less reliable given the difficult clinical delineation between dermatomal and named nerve sensory loss. However, in general, sensory disturbance involving the anterior and medial thigh and medial leg typically represents lumbar plexus involvement, while sensory disturbance involving the leg, dorsum of the foot, posterior thigh, and perineum suggests a lumbosacral trunk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sacral plexus lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the wide array of etiologies for patients presenting with signs and symptoms suspicious for LSP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52765\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52765 \">table 1</a>), an organized, thorough approach to diagnosis is a necessity. The diagnostic evaluation includes electrodiagnostic studies, laboratory investigations, and oftentimes neuroimaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough general and neurologic examination can aid in the localization of lumbosacral plexus lesion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detailed assessment of functional strength, sensation, and deep tendon reflexes of both lower limbs is compulsory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpation of the greater trochanters may reveal tenderness indicating focal bursitis. Palpation of the inguinal region should be undertaken to look for mass or hematoma formation. Rectal examination is important to assess tone and to look for rectal mass.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maneuvers such as the Patrick test and straight leg raising may provide clues to the presence of lumbosacral radiculopathy, which can sometimes mimic LSP, or a musculoskeletal lesion of the hip (eg, sacroiliitis).</p><p/><p>The Patrick test is a maneuver where the hip is externally rotated with the ipsilateral knee flexed at 90 degrees and placed on the opposite knee. The test is positive if it elicits hip or buttock pain. A positive test raises suspicion for hip or sacroiliac disease. However, it is nonspecific for a radiculopathy or plexopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with hip pain&quot;, section on 'Patrick (Fabere) test'</a>.)</p><p>The straight leg raise test is done with the patient supine. The examiner raises the patient's extended leg on the symptomatic side with the foot dorsiflexed, being careful that the patient is not actively &quot;helping&quot; in lifting the leg. The straight leg raise test is useful for the diagnosis of radiculopathy due to disc herniation, particularly for the L5 and S1 levels.</p><p>The reverse straight leg raise (femoral stretch) test is accomplished by placing the patient prone on the table and passively extending the hip and leg straight up off the plane of the table. This maneuver is most useful for evaluating the L2, L3, and L4 roots. However, the value of this test is limited by inadequate information on its sensitivity and specificity. A positive reverse straight leg raise test may be difficult to interpret due to supposed stretch of the femoral nerve, lumbar plexus, and lumbar spinal nerve root fibers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the advent of MRI, computed tomography (CT) was the most effective radiological method to investigate the lumbosacral plexus. MRI has superseded CT as the imaging method of choice for plexus evaluation given its versatility and improved anatomical detail. The superior anatomic resolution offered by MRI techniques compared with CT may increase the diagnostic accuracy and assist interventionalists or surgeons in preoperative planning. However, CT may be more readily available than MRI and remains the optimal choice for those with contraindications to MRI.</p><p>Gadolinium-enhancement can be helpful in certain instances, such as suspected neoplasm, abscess, inflammation, or postoperative changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrodiagnostic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrodiagnostic studies can help differentiate LSP from lumbosacral radicular and individual nerve syndromes, and may also provide clues to the intraplexus location and possible etiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electromyography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electromyography&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nerve conduction studies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Needle electromyography (EMG) should be done primarily to distinguish LSP from radiculopathy, isolated sciatic neuropathy, or femoral neuropathy, and to characterize the severity of involvement.

Upper limb EMG should be performed to exclude polyneuropathy if symptoms are bilateral or diffuse.</p><p>EMG of deep or paraspinal muscles is relatively contraindicated in certain patient populations, particularly those with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder, and those on anticoagulation therapy. In these subgroups, magnetic stimulation of nerve roots may be helpful in the diagnosis of LSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Nerve conduction studies with abnormal motor and intact sensory responses of lower limb, along with EMG findings in a myotomal distribution with paraspinal muscle involvement, typically indicate a radicular process rather than LSP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are limited options for performing NCS in the proximal lower limb. Femoral nerve conductions while recording from rectus femoris can be attempted. However, these are often painful and difficult because of body habitus. When responses are obtained, they are best utilized with side-to-side comparisons of amplitude and may help determine prognosis.</p><p>However, EMG abnormalities favoring acute denervation and chronic reinnervation of L2-, L3-, and L4-innervated thigh muscles but sparing thigh adductors, tibialis anterior, and corresponding paraspinal muscles can differentiate an isolated femoral neuropathy from LSP or lumbar radiculopathy.</p><p>Slowed peroneal motor nerve conduction velocities across the fibular head, with or without corresponding diminished motor responses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> superficial peroneal sensory involvement, can distinguish peroneal neuropathy from LSP.</p><p>EMG abnormalities in the hip abductors will help distinguish lumbosacral plexus lesions from sciatic nerve lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory investigations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suggested blood tests for LSP of unknown cause include a complete blood count, coagulation profile, glycated hemoglobin, sedimentation rate, c-reactive protein, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, angiotensin converting enzyme, serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, anti-Ro and La antibodies, and serologies for EBV, VZV, HIV, Lyme disease, and syphilis.</p><p>In the setting of a negative blood evaluation, a lumbar puncture to assess for leukocytes, protein, and cytology can be helpful to look for an occult infectious process or malignancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathologic investigation into patients with LSP will depend on the suspected etiology. Image-guided needle biopsies of intra-abdominal and intrapelvic organs and tissues are the gold standard for suspected neoplasm or infiltrative processes. However, for those in which the diagnosis remains elusive, there may be a role for fascicular biopsy of proximal nerves <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nerve roots.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of LSP are vast and diverse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52765\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52765 \">table 1</a>). The most common presentations are idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy and diabetic amyotrophy. These are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-amyotrophy-and-idiopathic-lumbosacral-radiculoplexus-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic amyotrophy and idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following sections will discuss of some of the more common causes of LSP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetic amyotrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetic amyotrophy is reviewed briefly here and discussed in detail separately.

It is not a pure LSP because it also affects the lumbosacral nerve roots and peripheral nerves. The traditional features include the acute, asymmetric, focal onset of pain followed by weakness involving the proximal leg, with associated autonomic failure and weight loss. However, onset in the distal leg is not uncommon. The condition becomes more widespread and symmetric with time. Progression occurs over months and is followed by partial recovery in most patients.</p><p>Thoracic and upper limb involvement has also been observed as part of the syndrome of diabetic amyotrophy in a minority of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy is similar to diabetic amyotrophy with respect to its pathophysiology, clinical features, prognosis, and management.

The most frequent mechanism of LSP from neoplasm is direct extension of tumor. Other common mechanisms include meningeal dissemination, secondary extension of tumor to the sacrum, iliac wings or lumbar vertebrae, hematogenous or lymphatic spread of cells from primary tumor sites, and paraneoplastic phenomenon.</p><p>Neoplastic invasion of the lumbosacral plexus can occur in multiple forms of cancer, including the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carcinoma (colorectal, breast, lung, gastric, thyroid, renal, ureteral, bladder, testicular, penile, prostate, cervical, ovarian, uterine, vaginal, melanoma)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sacral chordoma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sarcoma (retroperitoneal and pelvic), malignant schwannoma</p><p/><p>Lumbosacral plexopathies may also arise from benign tumors, such as benign uterine leiomyoma, neurofibromas, and plexiform lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>].</p><p>Neoplastic invasion typically presents with severe, lancinating pain with or without radicular symptoms. Patients can have positional or mechanical exacerbation of pain, and symptoms may be aggravated by lying supine, weight-bearing, or straining to have a bowel movement. Within weeks to months, pain is usually followed by the development of progressive numbness, paresthesia, and weakness. Weakness can proceed to focal paralysis such as foot drop (weakness of dorsiflexion), flail foot (weakness of both dorsiflexion and plantar flexion), loss of hip flexion, or loss of knee <span class=\"nowrap\">flexion/extension</span>.</p><p>One of the largest reports was published in the late 1980s and studied 85 patients with pelvic tumors and LSP, including 34 who were prospectively examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The following observations were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain at presentation was reported in 91 percent, and pain eventually developed in 98 percent. The pain was typically aching and pressure-like and could be local, radicular, or referred; a combination of local and radicular pain was common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical signs (from most to least frequent) included leg weakness (86 percent), sensory loss (73 percent), reflex asymmetry (64 percent), focal tenderness involving the sciatic notch, lumbar, or sacral spine (55 percent), positive direct (53 percent) and reverse (45 percent) straight leg raising test, leg edema (47 percent), rectal mass (39 percent), dysesthesia (15 percent), decreased sphincter tone (12 percent), and fasciculations (12 percent). Autonomic involvement was rare. Urinary incontinence tended to be associated with epidural extension of tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral plexopathy occurred in 27 percent and epidural extension was detected in 35 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common primary tumors were colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers, sarcoma, and lymphoma. Direct invasion from intra-abdominopelvic neoplasm was reported in 73 percent; the remainder had metastasis of extra-abdominopelvic tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metastatic lesions tended to affect the lower plexus while direct intra-abdominal or intrapelvic mass extension was more likely to affect the upper plexus. Approximately 20 percent of affected patients had a panplexopathy secondary to massive tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plexopathy developed within one year of primary tumor diagnosis in one-third of patients, and within three years in two-thirds. The symptoms of LSP preceded discovery of primary tumor in 15 percent of patients.</p><p/><p>There have been occasional reports of prostate cancer causing LSP with the suggestion of perineural spread of tumor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The authors postulated that the metastatic foci arose within the nerve or via perineural spread because there was evidence of tumor cells in the endoneurium, which is protected by the blood-nerve barrier, has no lymphatics, and is devoid of meninges, and not the epineurium where lymphatics and meninges exist. The authors also suggested that prostatic neoplastic cells may express nerve growth factor receptors, neural cell adhesion molecules, and anti-apoptotic factors, increasing the likelihood of cellular proliferation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general approach to the diagnosis of LSP is discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition to other disorders discussed in this topic, the differential diagnosis of LSP in a patient with cancer includes lumbosacral radiculopathy, meningeal carcinomatosis, cauda equina syndrome, retroperitoneal hemorrhage or iliopsoas hematoma, and radiation plexopathy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since many patients may present radicular symptoms, lumbosacral radiculopathies are often the first diagnostic consideration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningeal carcinomatosis is frequently associated with other clinical signs such as nuchal rigidity, cranial nerve palsies, mental status changes, or headache.

(See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Retroperitoneal hematoma'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>When there is suspicion for neoplasm as the cause of LSP, it is reasonable to evaluate the pelvic anatomy with contrast enhanced imaging using either MRI or CT. Limited retrospective data suggest that MRI is more sensitive than CT for detecting cancer as the cause of LSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. MRI can often differentiate among direct compression, metastatic disease, and primary infiltration of plexus structures. However, different stages of inflammation, hemorrhage, or necrosis can still make diagnosis challenging.</p><p>Lymphomas affecting the plexus have variable appearances on neuroimaging, ranging from asymmetric muscle enlargement and altered signal density on CT to focal or diffuse low T1-weighted or high T2-weighted signal on MRI. Contrast enhancement is also variable and may be absent, ring-shaped, or uniform. High-resolution MR neurography has demonstrated significant utility in diagnostic dilemmas involving lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Patients with LSP secondary to primary tumors in the abdominopelvic region tend to have a relatively focal disease process with lumbar plexus involvement due to direct extension. Thus, nerve conduction studies will most likely be normal or minimally involved. Electromyography will demonstrate abnormalities in the hip flexors, hip adductors, and knee extensors with sparing of lumbar paraspinal muscles.</p><p>Metastatic lesions are more likely to cause lumbosacral or sacral plexus involvement, with nerve conduction studies demonstrating diminished sensory and motor responses, and electromyography displaying abnormalities in hip abductors, knee flexors, ankle dorsiflexors, and plantar flexors, evertors, and invertors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis and management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the prognosis for patients with LSP due to tumor appears to be poor, although data are limited. In a series from the late 1980s of patients with tumor-related LSP, there were 59 patients who had follow-up examinations, and neurologic deterioration was noted in approximately 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among 67 patients not lost to follow-up at the end of the study, 40 had died. The median survival from time of diagnosis was approximately six months (range 1 to 34 months). Response to therapy often differs according to the type of tumor, and lymphoma was the most responsive tumor in this series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A small study of patients with advanced pelvic cancer found that dorsal rhizotomy was associated with a significant reduction in pain and opioid usage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The estimated incidence of LSP was significantly higher with sacral fractures 77 (2 percent) than with pelvic and acetabular fractures (0.7 percent). These findings probably underestimate the true incidence of LSP associated with pelvic fractures, since not all trauma patients were referred for electrodiagnostic studies. The close proximity of the plexus to the sacrum makes it more susceptible to injury from sacral fractures and dislocations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Trauma-induced LSP may go unnoticed due to either patient expiration from multiorgan involvement, or from inability to adequately assess neurologic function or incomplete work-up due to the severity of trauma and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

It usually involves the upper lumbar plexus from direct compression by the gravid uterus with symptoms most often occurring around 32 to 34 weeks of gestation.

The number of previous pregnancies does not appear to be an independent risk factor for developing LSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Vaginal deliveries are not contraindicated in women who develop antepartum or intrapartum LSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, midforceps delivery is relatively contraindicated in intrapartum LSP.</p><p>Some women with <span class=\"nowrap\">intrapartum/postpartum</span> LSP will be mistakenly diagnosed with L5 radiculopathy or peroneal palsy at the fibular head. Thus, it is important to differentiate LSP from peroneal or femoral neuropathy due to prolonged positioning. Electrodiagnostic findings in antepartum and <span class=\"nowrap\">intrapartum/postpartum</span> LSP will likely reflect lumbar plexus and lumbosacral plexus involvement, respectively.

In some instances, postoperative plexopathy is probably the result of intraoperative patient positioning that leads to stretching, compression, transection, or ligation of plexus components. Postoperatively, scar or undetected hematoma formation may lead to LSP. In other cases, plexopathy appears to be caused by a postsurgical inflammatory neuropathy similar to lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy by clinical and pathologic features, with findings on nerve biopsy that point to ischemic injury and microvasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].

Aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm formation (with or without rupture) of the abdominal aorta, common, external, and internal iliac arteries, inferior and superior gluteal arteries, and hypogastric arteries have all been described as causes of LSP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56082\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56082 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>]. Retroperitoneal hematoma predominantly affects the lumbar plexus while iliac artery aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm is more likely to compress the lumbosacral or sacral plexus.</p><p>The rich vascular supply to the lumbosacral plexus makes ischemia of the plexus rather unusual. However, ischemic LSP has been reported in kidney transplantation, especially in those who have pre-existing atherosclerotic disease, due transient hypoperfusion during arterial transposition or bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

Less often, a retroperitoneal hemorrhage will affect the entire lumbosacral plexus, causing a more confluent weakness and numbness of the ipsilateral leg.</p><p>Lumbosacral plexopathy due to retroperitoneal hematoma may occur spontaneously, but is best described as a sequelae of femoral artery or vein catheterizations and concomitant anticoagulation. It has also been reported after lumbar plexus block for postoperative analgesia in hip surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>] and following femoral vein dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. There is typically a delay of 2 to 10 days in presentation, likely due to postoperative institution of anticoagulant therapy. In addition, anticoagulant therapy alone has been associated with spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma and LSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective review of over 9200 femoral artery catheterizations, there were 45 cases of retroperitoneal hematoma, for an incidence of 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Clinical manifestations of retroperitoneal hematoma included suprainguinal tenderness and fullness, severe back and lower quadrant pain, and femoral neuropathy in 100, 64, and 36 percent, respectively.</p><p>Among the 45 patients with retroperitoneal hematoma, 20 developed neuropathy, which was confined to the groin and involved cutaneous branches of the femoral nerve in four patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The remaining 16 patients had large retroperitoneal hematomas and sensory neuropathy in the femoral nerve distribution, while nine had motor deficits involving only the femoral nerve, and four had motor weakness involving femoral plus obturator nerve. Thus, among 45 patients with a retroperitoneal hematoma, a lumbar plexopathy involving femoral and obturator nerves developed in four patients (9 percent) while an isolated femoral neuropathy developed in 12 (27 percent).</p><p>Hematomas are visualized well by both CT and MRI, with CT more likely to demonstrate active bleeding sites and MRI allowing more characterization of the age of collected blood products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Lumbosacral plexopathy due to retroperitoneal hematoma must be differentiated from isolated femoral nerve compression due to hematoma formation at the inguinal ligament or mild retroperitoneal hematoma with fascial tracking of blood to the femoral nerve sheath. Under the inguinal ligament, the femoral nerve is more susceptible to injury due to limited extraneural space for blood products to expand and a relative paucity of microvasculature and lack of collateral blood flow. Concomitant involvement of the obturator nerve, manifested as weakness of adduction, points to a lumbar plexus lesion and excludes an isolated femoral neuropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis and management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retrospective data suggest that patients with LSP from a retroperitoneal hematoma generally have good neurologic recovery. As an example, in one study that reported 16 patients with large retroperitoneal hematomas and lumbar plexopathy, the only persistent sequelae at long-term follow-up were a mild sensory neuropathy in five patients and a mild motor deficit in one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Treatment of retroperitoneal hematoma primarily consists of addressing the acute manifestations such as hypovolemia and shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

The anterior rami divide within the plexus into anterior and posterior divisions that in turn yield individual peripheral nerves.
