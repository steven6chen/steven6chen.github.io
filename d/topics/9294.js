However, the incidence of the disease was increasing even before the introduction of this test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63020\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63020 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The reasons for this increase are not known; both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A histologic diagnosis of prostate cancer is almost always required prior to instituting therapy for any stage of disease. Needle core biopsy of the prostate under ultrasound guidance is the most common method of obtaining diagnostic tissue. Other potential sources of diagnostic tissue include material from transurethral resections of the prostate (TURP), prostatectomy or cystoprostatectomy specimens, or biopsies from metastatic sites (most often lymph nodes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone).</p><p>This topic review will discuss the pathology of prostate cancer and the interpretation of the prostate biopsy.

This limited sampling explains why a random 12-core biopsy can miss tumor in at least 20 percent of cases and why the Gleason grade may be underestimated in another 20 to 30 percent of cases.</p><p>Saturation biopsy, using 24 or more cores, has been used to increase the likelihood of identifying areas of tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, this technique may be associated with an increased risk of complications.</p><p>The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to target a biopsy may substantially improve the ability to identify clinically significant lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. High-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma tends to have more dense glandular structures and a prominent desmoplastic stromal reaction, which can be better detected by MRI. Targeted biopsy will detect 10 to 15 percent more prostate cancers than standard 12-core biopsy and is particularly effective at detecting clinically significant lesions.

Other types of cancers (eg, transitional cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, lymphomas, or stromal sarcoma) do occur within the prostate. Here we will focus on the diagnostic features of prostatic adenocarcinoma; more comprehensive discussions of prostate biopsy interpretation are described elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Precancerous lesion of the prostate are discussed separately.

Architecturally, malignant cells form glands that are typically smaller than benign glands (acini or ducts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76155\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76155 \">picture 1</a>)), and the tumor cells tend to grow in an infiltrative and haphazard manner (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66109\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66109 \">picture 2</a>). In less differentiated tumors, the glandular pattern is irregular, less organized, fused, or even absent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63504\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63504 \">picture 3</a>), and the tumor cells tend to grow in as cords, nests, or sheets, more often in cribriform patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52604\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52604 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>Cytologically, the cytoplasm of tumor cells is often purple and darker than the pale cytoplasm of the benign epithelium on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained sections. Tumor cells often display nuclear enlargement, irregularity, and hyperchromasia, and large nucleoli can be seen in the majority of cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77354\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77354 \">picture 5</a>). Intraluminal crystalloids, amorphous secretion, or blue-tinged mucin are frequently present in malignant glands but are uncommonly found in benign glands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52171\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52171 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The common morphologic features associated with the diagnosis of malignancy as reported in one series of 250 needle biopsies performed at a single institution are listed in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59862\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59862 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunohistochemistry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has a limited role in pathologic diagnosis of prostate cancer on needle biopsy because both adenocarcinomas and benign prostatic epithelium are reactive. PSA IHC may be applied in biopsy material to confirm the prostatic origin of epithelial cells rather than determining whether they are benign or malignant. PSA-positive cells derived from lymph nodes, bone, or the prostate bed following prostatectomy are more likely to represent malignant cells than are those taken from an intact prostate.</p><p>IHC for high molecular weight cytokeratin (34bE12) can be performed in selected cases to identify basal cells, which are present in benign prostatic glands but absent in prostatic adenocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This immunostain should be used with caution because some cancer cells are positive and some benign prostatic glands display only weak staining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Another molecule, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), also known as P504S, is identified as a molecular marker for prostatic adenocarcinoma by complementary DNA microarray technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. AMACR is a useful marker for tissue diagnosis of prostate cancer in several studies reported by us (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77883\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77883 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>] and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/16,17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,21</a>]. We recommend a combination of 34bE12 (negative for prostatic adenocarcinoma) and AMACR (positive for prostatic adenocarcinoma) in selected prostate cases when diagnostic uncertainty is encountered.</p><p>More recently, p63, a nuclear protein present in prostatic basal cells and absent in prostatic adenocarcinomas, has also been shown to be a more reliable marker than 34bE12 because of its prominent nuclear staining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. We often used an IHC &quot;cocktail,&quot; which includes AMACR, p63, and 34bE12 antibodies.</p><p>ERG is a nuclear protein encoded by the <em>ERG</em> gene (an ETS related gene). The fusion between ERG and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS) has been found in prostatic adenocarcinoma. ERG immunostaining has been used to detect the TMPRSS-ERG fusion protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. ERG nuclear staining is detected in approximately 50 percent of prostatic adenocarcinoma cases in this country. The rate of ERG fusion in prostate cancer is lower for African Americans or Asians compared with Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The low sensitivity of ERG immunoreactivity may limit its clinical utility in diagnosis of prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, this fusion gene product is fairly specific for prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The clinical value of the ERG fusion in prostate cancer is still under investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3800860821\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroendocrine tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroendocrine tumors include prostatic adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The clinical and prognostic implications of neuroendocrine tumors are discussed elsewhere.

Neuroendocrine differentiation is more frequently seen in high-grade adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Focal neuroendocrine differentiation can be observed in several types of prostatic tumors that may have different biologic and biochemical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. As an example, focal neuroendocrine differentiation may be seen in 47 to 100 percent of cases of typical prostatic adenocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], particularly in high-grade tumors. Prostatic adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation can be seen in isolated tumor cells as eosinophilic granules.</p><p>The contribution of focal neuroendocrine differentiation to clinical behavior is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. There is insufficient evidence at this time to support treating these cases differently from typical high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma. We do not routinely perform IHC for neuroendocrine markers to search for focally positive areas of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4082227726\"><span class=\"h3\">Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor is also known as a carcinoid tumor. Morphologically similar to the counterpart in the gastrointestinal tract, this tumor is usually positive for neuroendocrine markers and negative for PSA. The well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of the prostate also may present with locally advanced disease, but it still has a favorable prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Small cell (neuroendocrine) carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroendocrine cells are normally present in a benign prostatic acinus or duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Small cell (neuroendocrine) carcinoma, a rare primary tumor of the prostate, is an aggressive and fatal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of small cell carcinomas of the prostate coexist with typical adenocarcinomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrapulmonary small cell cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathologic diagnosis requires the presence of a significant number of small, undifferentiated (oat cell) carcinoma cells demonstrating neuroendocrine features that are histologically identical to small cell carcinoma of the lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64298\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64298 \">picture 8</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;, section on 'Small cell carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>Small cell neuroendocrine tumors must be differentiated from carcinoid, well-differentiated tumors with neuroendocrine differentiation, which can also be found in the prostate either as primary or secondary involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The histological diagnosis is not different from that for carcinoid tumors seen in other organs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-characteristics-of-well-differentiated-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-arising-in-the-tubular-digestive-tract-lung-and-genitourinary-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical characteristics of well-differentiated neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors arising in the tubular digestive tract, lung, and genitourinary tract&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Neuroendocrine differentiation can be confirmed by IHC for neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin, synaptophysin, or neuron-specific enolase. Like small cell cancer involving the lung, small cell carcinoma of the prostate can be positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1); however, the rate of positivity is lower than that of pulmonary small cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Because small cell carcinomas of the prostate are typically resistant to hormonal therapy designed for prostatic adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], care should be taken to differentiate this entity from adenocarcinoma with focal neuroendocrine differentiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3338787367\"><span class=\"h3\">Large cell (neuroendocrine) carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is an entity newly incorporated into the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of prostate tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The tumor is composed of cells with prominent neuroendocrine features, including salt-pepper chromatin, high mitotic rate, and neuroendocrine differentiation supported by strong positivity for neuroendocrine markers immunohistochemically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110161\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110161 \">picture 9</a>). In addition, the tumor cells are larger than the cells seen in small cell carcinoma. The tumors do not show glandular differentiation as adenocarcinoma but often form large nests with peripheral palisading and necrosis. This tumor may be associated small cell carcinoma or high-grade adenocarcinoma. </p><p>Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is rare and highly aggressive, particularly the pure form, and is similar to small cell carcinoma in behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, the clinical experience of optimal management is limited because of its rarity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3533524001\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDCP) is a newly defined entity that has been described in detail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. </p><p>IDCP is defined as malignant epithelial cells filling large prostatic acini ducts, with preservation of basal cells forming either (1) solid or dense cribriform patterns or (2) a loose cribriform or micropapillary pattern with either marked nuclear atypia (nuclear size six times normal or larger) or nonfocal comedonecrosis. The controversy lies with the difficulty in distinguishing &quot;neoplastic cells&quot; in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) from &quot;malignant cells&quot; in IDCP, and the reproducibility in recognizing &quot;loose cribriform patterns&quot; where IDCP and high-grade PIN may overlap. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=precancerous-lesions-of-the-prostate-pathology-and-clinical-implications#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Precancerous lesions of the prostate: Pathology and clinical implications&quot;, section on 'Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia'</a>.)</p><p>IDCP has neoplastic cells growing within preexisting ducts in a noninvasive pattern, similar to high-grade PIN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62418\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62418 \">picture 10</a>). However, IDCP is associated with a risk of coexisting invasive adenocarcinoma in 90 to 100 percent of cases, unlike high-grade PIN, which is associated with a low risk for invasive carcinoma.</p><p>In a study of 21 radical prostatectomies in patients who originally had IDCP on biopsy, the average Gleason score was 7.9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Pathologic staging in these cases found that 11 (51 percent) had prostatic cancer with extraprostatic extension (pT3), eight (38 percent) had cancer that was confined to the prostate (pT2), and two (10 percent) showed only intraductal carcinoma without invasive cancer. IDCP may represent advanced prostatic adenocarcinoma in which invasive cells have propagated back into prostatic acini and ducts. Alternatively, IDCP may be a precursor of invasive adenocarcinoma in at least some cases.</p><p>Definitive therapy (prostatectomy, radiation therapy) is recommended in patients with an established diagnosis of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate on needle biopsy, even in the absence of pathologically documented invasive prostate cancer on needle biopsy, because of the risk of high-grade, high-stage prostatic adenocarcinoma.

Most of these tumors are due to direct extension into prostatic urethra or prostatic ducts from urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder, and prostate involvement may be identified in 12 to 48 percent of patients who undergo radical cystectomy for urothelial bladder cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Based on the old literature, primary urothelial carcinoma of the prostate was estimated at 1 to 4 percent of prostatic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, these numbers for primary prostatic urothelial carcinoma were obtained before the radical prostatectomy era, and therefore, the actual incidence may be lower.</p><p>Urothelial carcinoma is not infrequent in prostate needle core biopsy because needle biopsy sample areas are mostly in the prostatic peripheral zone. Because of the differences in clinical management, it is important to recognize urothelial carcinoma, which displays morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics different from prostatic adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Distinguishing primary prostatic urothelial carcinoma from secondary involvement of the prostate by bladder cancer is very difficult on biopsy specimens. Therefore, clinical investigation of the bladder and urinary tract is necessary if urothelial carcinoma is initially detected in the prostate. The presence of prostatic stromal invasion of urothelial carcinoma, which is associated with worse prognosis, should be evaluated in the case of prostatic urothelial carcinoma, in addition to the grade and location of the tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">KEY COMPONENTS OF THE PATHOLOGY REPORT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">When cancer is present</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histologic diagnosis of prostate cancer on a biopsy specimen must be made without any uncertainty. Any equivocal diagnostic term, such as &quot;possible,&quot; &quot;likely,&quot; &quot;suspicious,&quot; or &quot;atypical,&quot; should not be accepted as a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Therapy should not be initiated for a patient based on an equivocal or uncertain diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Cases with diagnostic uncertainty'</a> below.) </p><p>When prostatic adenocarcinoma is present on needle biopsy, it is not sufficient to simply confirm its presence.

A higher score indicates a greater likelihood of having non-organ-confined disease, as well as a worse outcome after treatment of localized disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Based upon the growth pattern and degree of differentiation, tumors are graded from 1 to 5, with grade 1 being the most and grade 5 the least differentiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>The Gleason grade for the two most prevalent differentiation patterns has been used to create the Gleason score and is now being used in the newly adopted grade group system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374972233\"><span class=\"h5\">Composite Gleason score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The composite Gleason score is derived by adding together the numerical values for the two most prevalent differentiation patterns (a primary grade and a secondary grade). As an example, if a biopsy consists of predominantly grade 3 and secondarily grade 4 disease, the combined score is &quot;3 plus 4&quot; or 7. As more experience has been gained with Gleason grading, pathologists generally will not diagnose prostate cancer with composite Gleason scores of 2 to 5; thus, the range of composite Gleason scores on prostate biopsies is Gleason 6 to 10.</p><p>The Gleason score has been the preferred system for grading tumors and was incorporated as a key prognostic factor in the 2010 tumor, nodes, metastasis (TNM) staging system for prostate cancer. In the eighth (2017) edition of the TNM staging system, the Gleason score information has been incorporated into the histologic grade group, which is used in assigning patients to prognostic stage groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729 \">table 4</a>).

The short answer for that question is definitively &quot;yes.&quot; Prostatic adenocarcinoma with Gleason 6 (3+3) is one of the most common forms of prostate cancer, most likely representing the early phase of prostate cancer.</p><p>Key issues that clarify this confusion include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gleason grading of prostate cancer is based on the architectural features, not cytological features, of the tumor cells. In other words, Gleason grade 6, Gleason grade 7, and Gleason grade 8 are all composed of malignant cells with similar cytological features but with different architectural patterns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The features of Gleason grade 6 adenocarcinoma include uncontrolled growth, invasive nature, and the lack of basal cells. All of these are the characteristics of a malignant neoplasm. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost all the cases of very low-volume prostate cancer demonstrate Gleason 6 (or lower), which suggests that they are the early phase of prostate cancer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small subset of Gleason 6 adenocarcinomas do give rise to metastatic disease, but with current techniques, we cannot determine which cases of Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma will progress and which will not. In a multicenter study of 100 cases of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate reported in 1999, only 10 percent of the metastatic tumors were derived from Gleason 6 adenocarcinomas, while 90 percent were derived from primary adenocarcinomas with Gleason score 7 or higher. The percentage arising from Gleason score 6 would be lower with contemporary grading systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In rare cases, the Gleason 6 tumors may extend outside the prostate and become stage 3 disease (unpublished data).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needle core biopsy is subject to sampling errors. Therefore, a prostate with biopsy-proven Gleason 6 tumor may harbor occult higher grade tumors, and these undetected high-grade tumors can metastasize. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Furthermore, Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma may rarely progress into Gleason 7, or higher grade cancer, and subsequently lead to progression or metastases without treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Patients with Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma frequently are considered for management with active surveillance. The results from these programs have shown that some of these patients apparently progress to Gleason 7 disease and require definitive treatment. Most of these cases can be attributed to sampling errors; others are interpreted to be true progression.

The other groups include grade group 2 to Gleason 7 (3+4), grade group 3 to Gleason 7 (4+3), grade group 4 to Gleason 8, and grade group 5 to Gleason 9 or 10. These grade groups corresponded with progressively decreased five-year recurrence-free survivals (95, 83, 65, 63, and 35 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]).</p><p/><p>In summary, Gleason 6 prostatic adenocarcinoma is a common form of prostate cancer. If it is of a small volume, Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma may be considered to be the early phase of prostate cancer, which can be clinically &quot;insignificant.&quot; Significant percentages of cases with Gleason 6 on needle core biopsies will progress to higher grades and higher volume tumor if not treated, although the latent period of progression is uncertain. The patients who meet the strict criteria of &quot;clinically insignificant cancer&quot; can choose to be on the active surveillance program, but close follow-up with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density, free PSA, and repeat biopsy is necessary to detect early progression to high-grade tumors in this group of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H528216765\"><span class=\"h4\">Gleason 3+4 and 4+3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gleason 3+4 and 4+3 were formally grouped as Gleason score 7; however, these groups differ substantially in prognosis and have been divided into grade group 2 and grade group 3, respectively. Men with Gleason 4+3 tumors (where grade 4 is more prevalent than grade 3) have a less favorable outcome than do those with Gleason 3+4 disease, where grade 3 is more prevalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/61-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-66</a>]. As an example, a multivariate analysis of a single-institution series of 1333 men with Gleason 7 prostate cancer found a significantly increased risk of seminal vesicle invasion in those with Gleason 4+3 disease (20 versus 9 percent, odds ratio [OR] 2.26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

The new group grading system, as discussed above, separates Gleason score 7 into grade group 2 (Gleason 3+4) and grade group 3 (Gleason 4+3) to address the different risks associated with each group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H826500327\"><span class=\"h4\">Gleason 8, grade group 4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gleason score 8, grade group 4 includes patients with Gleason score 4+4 disease as well as those with Gleason score 3+5 or 5+3 prostate cancer. In a contemporary cohort study, the presence of a component of Gleason grade 5 (either 3+5 or 5+3) was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer mortality (adjusted HR 2.77, 95% CI 1.13-6.80) compared with Gleason score 4+4 disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

Traditionally, the tertiary Gleason grade has been noncontributory to the overall Gleason score in biopsy specimens. However, in 2005, the ISUP consensus conference recommended that men with biopsy Gleason score 3+4 or 4+3 prostate cancer and a tertiary pattern 5 should have their cancers classified as Gleason score 8 or 9, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. These men have a higher pathologic tumor stage and an increased risk of biochemical and clinical recurrence compared with men who have Gleason score 7 disease without a tertiary grade 5 component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/65,71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,71-73</a>].</p><p>For radical prostatectomy specimens, the tertiary pattern should be reported in addition to the Gleason score, eg, &quot;Gleason 4+3 = 7 with tertiary 5 pattern (ISUP grade group 3).&quot;</p><p>The percentage of a tumor consisting of high-grade prostate cancer (ie, combined Gleason pattern 4 or 5) may provide additional prognostic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In a series of 504 consecutive patients undergoing prostatectomy, an increasing percentage of high-grade tumor was associated with a statistically significant poorer cancer-specific survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H528216779\"><span class=\"h4\">Clinical application of Gleason score and grade group</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The numerical Gleason score or grade group is of clinical relevance since it is a component of most nomograms and tables that estimate prognosis based upon pretreatment variables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729 \">table 4</a>).

For example, a diagnosis of &quot;prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 4&quot; is confusing. It could mean a tumor with Gleason score &quot;2+2&quot; or 4, which is a low-grade tumor with limited aggressive behavior, or it could mean a tumor with Gleason score &quot;4+4&quot; or 8, which is very aggressive. A Gleason score or grade group should be reported even for a single small focus of cancer on needle biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Several studies suggest that contemporary Gleason grade readings may be significantly higher than they were 10 years ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>]. The effect of this subtle upgrading of Gleason scores over time could be an apparent improvement in outcome for all categories of men with clinically localized prostate cancer (the so-called Will Rogers phenomenon). This issue has the potential to impact the interpretation of studies that suggest improvements in outcome from treatment over time.</p><p>There can be substantial interobserver variability in the Gleason grading of a biopsy specimen, particularly for pathologists with less experience interpreting prostate biopsies. In a study in which the interpretations from 29 pathologists were compared with that of an expert in prostate cancer pathology on an average of 278 samples, only 68 percent of samples were correctly classified as Gleason score &lt;7, 7, or &gt;7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Therefore, additional training may be necessary for those pathologists who are unfamiliar with the Gleason grading system.</p><p>Furthermore, there can be significant discrepancies between the Gleason score as determined on the prostate biopsy, and the Gleason score based upon the final, pathologic specimen.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The &quot;diagnosis&quot; of BPH on a needle biopsy specimen should be avoided since it may give a false impression that it is the cause of serum PSA elevation. Some pathologists routinely diagnose BPH in every prostate needle biopsy specimen without sufficient histologic evidence. However, BPH cannot be reliably diagnosed in such specimens because histologic diagnosis requires the presence of hyperplastic nodules, which cannot be assessed on needle core tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Cases with diagnostic uncertainty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a prostate biopsy is undertaken, a definitive pathologic diagnosis of prostate cancer is usually needed for clinical management. Unfortunately, definitive diagnosis is not always possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p>For the diagnosis of invasive cancer to be made, there must be absolutely no doubt on the part of the consulting pathologist. A firm diagnosis of limited prostate cancer on needle core biopsy is one of the most difficult areas in surgical pathology. The histologic features of prostatic adenocarcinoma are complex and may be subtle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. An error in any step of tissue processing, including tissue fixation, dehydration, embedding, and even staining, may interfere with a proper diagnosis.</p><p>Even if tissue processing is perfect, a definitive diagnosis of cancer may still be difficult for even an experienced pathologist. One of the most common problems that interferes with the ability to make a definitive diagnosis is the size of the suspicious lesion. Most pathologists do not feel comfortable making a diagnosis of malignancy when the focus of concern contains only a few atypical glands or acini.</p><p>In the situation where the pathologist is suspicious but not totally convinced about a diagnosis of prostate cancer, the term &quot;atypical glands suspicious for, but not diagnostic of, prostatic adenocarcinoma&quot; is often applied. Although other pathologists prefer the diagnostic term &quot;atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) suspicious for prostatic adenocarcinoma&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>], this phrase has been criticized because it may be confused with a definite cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>].</p><p>Between 1 and 23 percent of needle biopsy pathology specimens (average 5 percent) have a diagnosis of atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. This is not a pathologic entity but a diagnostic term that is used when there is suspicion for but not sufficient evidence to make a definitive diagnosis of cancer. Because the average risk of subsequently documenting cancer following an atypical or suspicious diagnosis is approximately 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>], repeat biopsy is necessary within three to six months in all cases. Repeat biopsy should include more sampling of the initial atypical site as well as other areas. Some urologists prefer saturated biopsy methods in which more than 24 cores are taken.</p><p>The incidence of an uncertain atypical diagnosis is lower when IHC staining for high molecular weight cytokeratin (34bE12), p63, or alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) is applied (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immunohistochemistry'</a> above). The significance of finding ASAP in men with high-grade PIN in a needle biopsy specimen is discussed elsewhere.

The testes account for 90 to 95 percent of total circulating testosterone, while the adrenal glands produce the remainder. In the prostate, testosterone is converted into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50484\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50484 \">figure 2</a>). DHT is the primary androgen that stimulates the growth of both benign and malignant prostate tissues.</p><p>Huggins and Hodges were the first to show that palliation of metastatic disease could be achieved by androgen ablation, which can be accomplished surgically (orchiectomy) or medically by administration of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs, estrogens, or androgen receptor blockers (anti-androgens) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/111,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">111,112</a>]. Although androgen ablation is usually reserved for the treatment of advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, it may be used in men with less advanced disease (ie, clinically organ-confined or locally advanced) as an adjunct to radiation therapy (RT) or surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial systemic therapy for castration-sensitive prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Androgen ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of the method of androgen ablation, the histologic changes in the prostate gland are indistinguishable. The effects can be shown both in normal secretory epithelium and in adenocarcinoma cells, the vast majority of which maintain the secretory epithelial phenotype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50546\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50546 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">113,114</a>]. Regression and degenerative changes, such as pyknotic nuclei, clear cytoplasm, or vacuolated cytoplasm, are evident, while the features of cytologic atypia (eg, nuclear enlargement and prominent nucleoli) that are typically present in adenocarcinoma cells are diminished or absent. These changes can cause difficulty in assessment of prostate biopsies and may result in underestimation of the extent of disease if hormone therapy was administered prior to a biopsy or prostatectomy. Furthermore, because of the severe histologic changes in tumor cells caused by prior hormonal therapy, the assignment of a Gleason score is unreliable in this situation and is usually withheld.</p><p>Despite this, the infiltrating pattern of a prostatic adenocarcinoma is mostly retained and can be recognized. In particular, identification of scattered individual malignant epithelial cells in the stroma is diagnostic evidence of prostatic adenocarcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69529\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69529 \">picture 16</a>). Immunostaining for keratins or for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) may be helpful in identifying the individual tumor cells in this situation to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].</p><p>Other nonspecific histologic changes, including basal cell hyperplasia, transitional cell and squamous cell metaplasia in benign epithelium, and chronic inflammation, may also be present. These nonspecific histologic changes in benign prostatic epithelial cells often provide the pathologist with a clue as to the use of prior hormonal therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Finasteride and dutasteride</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dutasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dutasteride</a>, which are widely used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are considered to be weak anti-androgens.

Therefore, the histologic diagnosis of prostate cancer on biopsy specimens from men receiving finasteride or dutasteride is not difficult.</p><p>However, it has been suggested that 5-alpha reductase inhibitors have the potential to alter the Gleason score of prostate cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. This hypothesis was proposed largely to explain the findings of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT), in which men treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> had fewer prostate cancers overall but significantly more tumors of Gleason score 7 to 10 than with the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. However, this observation was not confirmed in two other trials, and the relationship between 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and Gleason score in incident prostate cancer remains unsettled. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemoprevention strategies in prostate cancer&quot;, section on '5-Alpha reductase inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p>Administration of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor may complicate the diagnosis of a prostate cancer because these agents produce a nearly 50 percent decrease in serum PSA concentrations during the first three months of therapy, which persists as long as the drug is continued.

Positive results on rebiopsy do not add significant clinical information to that provided by sequential serum PSA measurements following therapy. Rebiopsy is <strong>not</strong> routine following RT and is indicated only if the PSA is rising and salvage surgery or brachytherapy is being considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Salvage local therapy&quot;, section on 'Patient selection'</a>.)</p><p>The majority of series describing the histologic appearance of the irradiated prostate gland were derived from patients receiving external beam RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/123,124\" class=\"abstract_t\">123,124</a>]. Histologic changes following brachytherapy are qualitatively similar but may be more pronounced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">124,125</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several weeks after RT has begun, prostatic cells undergo severe degenerative changes, including nuclear shrinkage and cytoplasmic damage. Occasionally, small foci of necrosis will be evident, both in benign and malignant glands. Acute inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and later lymphocytes, accumulate. Gradually, the infiltration of reactive cells subsides, and fibrosis develops in areas of tissue damage. This acute phase of reaction to RT is rarely seen in biopsy material because so few patients undergo routine biopsy, and those who do generally have their biopsy at least six months after RT. At that time, residual cancer cells may or may not be evident in the biopsy specimen (see below).</p><p>In response to RT, benign epithelial and stromal cells develop cytological atypia, with the epithelial cells having prominent nuclear irregularity, hyperchromasia, and polymorphic changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50546\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50546 \">table 7</a>). Because of the presence of smudged nuclei, prominent nucleoli are not commonly seen. Irradiated benign epithelial cells often show a slightly spindled appearance, termed &quot;streaming&quot; histology. Despite marked nuclear atypia, benign glands still retain their lobular pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66055\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66055 \">picture 17</a>).</p><p>Nonspecific histologic changes, such as chronic inflammation, basal cell proliferation, or stromal fibrosis, may also be present to varying degrees. Postradiation changes in the benign glands may persist for a long time following prostatic RT, causing difficulty interpreting prostate biopsies in irradiated men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. In diagnostically difficult cases, immunostaining specific for basal cells may be helpful, often showing positive staining in the benign atypical cells but not in malignant cells.</p><p>In contrast to the benign glands, the characteristic haphazard infiltrating architectural pattern and cytological features of malignant prostate glands are often retained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50546\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50546 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Irradiated tumor cells may display clear cytoplasm and other degenerative changes, or they may show no apparent histological changes from the radiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64711\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64711 \">picture 18</a>).</p><p>The presence of malignant cells six months following RT to the prostate should not be interpreted as treatment failure. The long doubling time of many prostate tumors, coupled with radiobiological data indicating that cell death following RT is a postmitotic event, suggests that the time course of disappearance of viable cancer from the prostate is prolonged. As a result, false-positive biopsies may be due to delayed tumor regression, and indeterminate biopsies (usually showing radiation effect in viable tumor cells) are of uncertain significance. In one series, for example, 30 percent of indeterminate biopsies showed eventual clearance of tumor at a mean time of 30 months following RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. A higher number of indeterminate biopsies may convert to negative in men undergoing brachytherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p>A biopsy that demonstrates the presence of tumor cells beyond 18 to 24 months is more likely to indicate active disease (either persistence or a local recurrence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/127-129\" class=\"abstract_t\">127-129</a>]; however, even this is not absolute. In at least one series, 22 of 46 men who underwent routine prostate biopsy after combined external beam RT and brachytherapy had evidence of residual tumor cells; however, 16 had no evidence of an elevated serum PSA (biochemical failure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].</p><p>Whether the Gleason grade of recurrent adenocarcinoma following a course of RT accurately reflects tumor aggressiveness or clinical behavior is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].
