Edaravone was found to slow functional deterioration in some patients with ALS, as observed in randomized controlled trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An earlier 24-week trial randomized 206 subjects with ALS who had a disease duration of three years, lived independently, and had forced vital capacity (FVC) of &ge;70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The primary outcome measure was the change in the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) score, in which higher scores indicate better function. After the 24-week treatment period, there was no benefit for function on the ALSFRS-R score with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edaravone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edaravone</a> treatment compared with placebo (-5.7 versus -6.35, mean difference 0.65, 95% CI -0.90 to 2.19). However, a post hoc analysis showed a greater treatment effect in the subgroup of subjects with definite or probable ALS at entry who had scores of 2 or more on all items of the ALSFRS-R, an FVC of at least 80 percent at baseline, and a disease duration of two years or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent controlled trial enrolled 137 Japanese subjects with early-stage ALS who were selected to match the subset of patients defined by the post hoc analysis of the previous trial (ie, definite or probable ALS by the El Escorial criteria, a disease duration of two years or less, independent living status, scores of 2 or more on all items of ALSFRS-R, and an FVC of &ge;80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edaravone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edaravone</a> or placebo. At 24 weeks, there was a smaller decline in function, measured by the ALSFRS-R, for the edaravone group compared with the placebo group (-5.01 versus -7.50, difference 2.49, 95% CI 0.99-3.98). This change was considered clinically significant, with a slowing of approximately 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In addition, subjects assigned to edaravone experienced less decline on the ALS Assessment Questionnaire (ALSAQ-40).</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=edaravone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Edaravone</a> was approved in 2015 for the treatment of ALS in Japan and Korea, and received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for all people with ALS in May 2017 to treat patients with ALS in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In vitro models of cell death based on superoxide dismutase (SOD1) enzyme dysfunction were developed after the discovery of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Cu/Zn</span> <em>SOD1</em> gene abnormalities in familial ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>], and several mouse and rat models expressing mutant forms of the <em>SOD1</em> gene<em> </em>exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In addition, transgenic rodent models of ALS were developed based upon mutant forms of the human TDP-43 gene (<em>TARDBP</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. The experimentally induced mutations G93A, G37R, and G85R in the transgenic mouse models have phenotypes similar to human ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. There are also naturally occurring mouse models including the motor neuron degeneration (Mnd), progressive motor neuropathy (pmn), and wobbler, and models of motor neuron disease in flies, worms, and induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC) motor neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/50-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-54</a>].</p><p>The transgenic <em>SOD1</em> mouse model is considered the most accurate representation of the disease process. However, the utility of this animal model for screening potential human ALS treatments is not established.

The limitations and short-comings of these agents are related to unfavorable pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and dose-limiting toxicities, in addition to the possibility that antibody inactivation may occur. However, alternative methods of drug delivery, such as gene therapy or mesenchymal derived cells modified to deliver growth factor, may be warranted.

Motor neurons appear to have a high threshold for activation of the heat shock protein pathway, and <em>SOD1 </em>gene mutations may contribute to reduced antiapoptotic capability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Treatment of G93A mice with arimoclomol, a coinducer of heat shock proteins, delayed disease progression and improved survival by 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>A trial of arimoclomol in 38 people with <em>SOD1</em>-mutant ALS found that a dose of 200 mg three times daily was safe and well tolerated for up to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Secondary efficacy outcomes suggested possible clinical benefit; however, confidence intervals were wide due to the small number of patients enrolled. Larger studies using higher doses in a broader patient population are under consideration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Gene therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previous clinical trials with neurotrophic factors have shown equivocal to negative results (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Experimental therapy'</a> above). Research in a transgenic mouse model found that IGF-I can be delivered directly to respiratory and motor limb muscles to target the affected motor neurons by using the retrograde transport ability of adeno-associated virus (AAV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. IGF-I delivered by this vector delays disease onset and prolongs survival by 30 percent in the preclinical model and 18 percent in the postsymptomatic model in the <em>SOD1</em>-mutant mouse model.</p><p>In a similar method, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (<em>GDNF</em>) gene was injected into lower-extremity muscles of a G93A transgenic mouse using a replication defective adenoviral vector [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Larger motor neurons were seen in the injected muscles, suggesting gene therapy may delay progression in ALS.</p><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is needed for angiogenesis and has been implicated in neuroprotection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. Researchers have shown that low levels of VEGF in transgenic mice can cause an ALS-like syndrome. Furthermore, intramuscular delivery of VEGF has shown delayed onset and prolonged survival in <em>SOD1</em> mice.</p><p>In a study of intracerebroventricular delivery of VEGF gene therapy in transgenic rats, VEGF delayed disease onset, improved motor performance, and delayed the onset of paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. This particular route was chosen over intrathecal delivery because of a speculated improved effect on bulbar and cervical motor neurons rather than motor neurons in the lumbar cord. VEGF gene therapy will likely be investigated in human trials in the near future.</p><p>Another approach to gene therapy employs antisense oligonucleotides to downregulate or silence mutant genes. The antisense strategy targets specific RNA sequences by constructing complementary oligonucleotides that bind to the native mRNA sequences and reduce their translation and subsequent protein expression.</p><p>In a preliminary study, continuous intraventricular infusion of antisense oligonucleotides to <em>SOD1 </em>reduced both SOD1 protein and mRNA levels throughout the rat brain and spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. In addition, this treatment significantly slowed disease progression when initiated prior to disease onset in a rat model of ALS caused by an <em>SOD1 </em>mutation. A preliminary human trial of an antisense oligonucleotide to <em>SOD1 </em>(ISIS 333611) found that the drug was well tolerated and achieved predicted levels in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Other antisense oligonucleotide studies are ongoing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1351732\"><span class=\"h3\">Tirasemtiv</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tirasemtiv is a fast skeletal muscle troponin activator that works by increasing the sensitivity of the sarcomere to calcium, which amplifies the force of muscle contraction when motor nerves are stimulated at submaximal rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-85</a>]. The drug was developed as a therapy to increase muscle strength for patients with neuromuscular disease such as ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In an <em>SOD1</em> transgenic mouse model of ALS, tirasemtiv significantly increased muscle strength and performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Findings from early short-term human clinical trials suggested beneficial effects of tirasemtiv for measures of function, strength, and endurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>].

Significant issues regarding tolerability of tirasemtiv were noted, resulting in differential dropout and dose reductions in the active treatment groups versus placebo.
