All other cell lines are present and seem quantitatively and morphologically normal. Many cases of acquired PRCA are idiopathic. In others, underlying conditions, such as thymoma, myelodysplastic syndromes, lymphoma, leukemia, systemic autoimmune disorders, and viral infection (ie, parvovirus B19), or treatment with drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a>, are identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-pure-red-cell-aplasia-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired pure red cell aplasia in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PRCA has also been described in patients treated with epoetin (EPO), resulting from the induction of neutralizing antibodies directed against the EPO molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most reported cases have been in patients receiving EPO for chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related anemia.</p><p>PRCA due to anti-EPO antibodies in patients with CKD will be reviewed here. A discussion of other causes of acquired PRCA is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-pure-red-cell-aplasia-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired pure red cell aplasia in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of non-erythropoietin (EPO)-related PRCA are mediated by immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies or cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against erythroid precursor or progenitor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Inhibition of erythropoiesis occurs primarily between the colony forming unit&ndash;erythroid (CFU-E) and proerythroblast stages. The proerythroblast is the first morphologically identifiable erythroid precursor in normal marrow and is virtually absent in the marrow of patients with PRCA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-pure-red-cell-aplasia-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired pure red cell aplasia in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PRCA due to autoantibodies against endogenous EPO is rare in patients who have never been treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The serum of patients with EPO-related PRCA inhibits the growth of erythroid progenitor cells in bone marrow cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Neutralizing IgG antibodies to the protein component of exogenous recombinant EPO are found that crossreact with endogenous EPO.</p><p>There are several preparations of EPO (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epoetin alfa</a>, epoetin beta, epoetin omega, and others), produced by various manufacturers around the world. They differ from one another and from the native hormone in terms of glycosylation and sialic acid content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The vast majority of cases of EPO-related PRCA have occurred in patients treated with a particular epoetin alfa product (Eprex, in single-use syringes), which was manufactured and distributed outside the United States. Altered antigenicity of this specific product has been suggested as the underlying cause of anti-EPO antibody development. However, EPO-related PRCA has been described with other preparations included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darbepoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darbepoetin alfa</a> (very rarely) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-14</a>].</p><p>Virtually all reported cases of anti-EPO antibody-mediated PRCA have occurred in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who have received the drug subcutaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/2,8,9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,9,15</a>]. Although not specifically studied with EPO, subcutaneous administration of other drugs has been associated with greater immunogenicity than with intravenous (IV) administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of erythropoietin (EPO)-related PRCA have occurred in patients with renal failure in Europe and the United Kingdom, but patients in Canada, Australia, and countries in Asia have also been affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/8,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17</a>].</p><p>The condition remains extremely rare, given the widespread use of EPO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The overall incidence of reported cases between 1989 and June 2004 was 1.6 per 10,000 patient-years of subcutaneous exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

There was a substantial increase in the number of reported cases between 2001 and 2003, almost exclusively in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who received Eprex subcutaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/8,10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,17</a>].</p><p>This increase in the number of cases was later discovered to coincide with the release of a new formulation and packaging of EPO, as discussed above. The incidence was 3.43 per 10,000 patient-years of exposure for Eprex supplied in syringes with uncoated rubber stoppers compared with 0.23 and 0.17 per 10,000 patient-years for Eprex preparations in coated rubber-stopper syringes and stabilized with human serum albumin (HSA), respectively.</p><p>One report of the multinational Prospective Immunogenicity Surveillance Registry (PRIMS) described five confirmed episodes of EPO-related PRCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Three episodes occurred with a reformulated Eprex preparation, and two occurred with other ESAs among over 15,000 patients, with an incidence (per 100,000 patient-years) of 35.8 for Eprex and 14 for other ESAs (rate ratio 2.56, 95% CI 0.43-15.31), which was not statistically significantly different.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-Eprex cases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall incidence of reported cases between 1989 and 2004 of PRCA with subcutaneous use of non-Eprex preparations was much lower, ranging from 0.02 to 0.16 per 10,000 patient-years between 1989 and 2004, depending on the preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/8,17,20,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,20,24,25</a>].</p><p>Fortunately, it appears that the incidence of anti-EPO antibody-mediated PRCA in patients with kidney disease has declined following changes in storage and handling recommendations and discontinuation of the subcutaneous administration of Eprex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/8,17,22,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,22,26,27</a>] (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review published in late 2004, the exposure-adjusted incidence decreased worldwide by &gt;80 percent after the incorporation of such interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was an exposure-related incidence of anti-EPO antibody-mediated PRCA of only 0.02 to 0.03 per 10,000 patient-years, as reported among EPO manufacturers in December 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p>EPO antibody-mediated PRCA has only rarely been reported in children with renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/17,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,29</a>].</p><p>&quot;Biosimilar&quot; epoetin products are becoming increasingly available around the world; treatment with these agents has also been associated with development of anti-EPO neutralizing antibodies, with a notable outbreak in Thailand related to subcutaneous use of a biosimilar produced outside the United States and the European Union [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FOR ANTI-EPO ANTIBODIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among dialysis patients, routine screening for the presence of anti-erythropoietin (EPO) antibodies cannot be justified.

The underlying cause may be organic compounds (leached by polysorbate from uncoated rubber stoppers in prefilled syringes) that are acting as adjuvants, resulting in anti-EPO antibody development. Virtually all reported cases of anti-EPO antibody-mediated PRCA have occurred in patients with chronic kidney disease who have received the drug subcutaneously. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EPO-related PRCA remains extremely rare, given the widespread use of EPO. There have been &gt;200 reported cases of PRCA related to Eprex use, which represent the vast majority of affected patients. Following changes in storage and handling recommendations and discontinuation of subcutaneous administration of Eprex, the incidence of anti-EPO antibody-mediated PRCA in patients with kidney disease has declined. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for the presence of anti-EPO antibodies should not be routinely performed in dialysis patients. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Screening for anti-EPO antibodies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EPO-induced PRCA should be considered in the patient with significant anemia who has been treated with EPO for at least three to four weeks and has previously responded to treatment with EPO. The condition is characterized by a sudden decline in hemoglobin (Hb) level despite continued use of EPO, markedly reduced reticulocyte count, and normal white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To definitively diagnose EPO-induced PRCA, a bone marrow aspirate and evaluation for the presence of neutralizing anti-EPO antibodies should be performed. The bone marrow reveals severe erythroid hypoplasia, with &lt;5 percent red blood cell precursors, and there may be evidence of a block in the maturation of erythroid precursors. Platelet and white cell precursors are entirely normal. Anti-EPO antibodies are detected by radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), or other assay, as available. The sample must be sent to the manufacturer for testing to document the presence of anti-EPO antibodies and evidence of their neutralizing ability. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend the cessation of all recombinant EPO preparations in patients with PRCA (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).

Patients should be transfused for severe symptomatic anemia. Our recommendations concerning rechallenge are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppressive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given that spontaneous remissions after cessation of EPO therapy are rare, we recommend the administration of immunosuppressive therapy in most patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

A reasonable alternative for first-line therapy is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> alone at a dose of 200 mg per day (or 100 mg twice per day) for a maximum of three to four months. Patients who do not respond to initial treatment with either oral cyclophosphamide plus prednisone or with cyclosporine alone may be subsequently treated with the other regimen. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tacrolimus</a> may also be considered as an alternative to cyclosporine.
