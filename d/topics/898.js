They range in complexity from minimally invasive, single-level decompression to highly complex, multi-stage extensive reconstruction. Operative procedures for degenerative spine disease and herniated disks are most common in those under 60 years of age, while those over 60 years of age most commonly undergo spine surgery for spinal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Anesthesia providers will increasingly care for patients having spine surgery as the population ages and clinical innovation and technological advancement continue. This topic will discuss preoperative evaluation and intraoperative management of adult patients having elective spine surgery. Selection of patients for surgical treatment and options for surgical treatment are discussed to a greater extent in other topics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Surgical treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'Indications for spinal surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478155367\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative evaluation should focus on assessment of the airway and the respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurologic organ systems.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Airway evaluation</strong> &ndash; Airway management for patients presenting for spine surgery may be difficult, particularly when surgery on the upper thoracic or cervical spine is planned. These patients may present with diseases that distort airway anatomy or restrict neck or jaw movement, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, neuromuscular disorders, and previous radiation of the head or neck. In addition, these patients may have instability of the cervical spine, which will affect the choice of intubation technique. (See <a href=\"#H606892143\" class=\"local\">'Airway management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Airway evaluation and management are discussed more fully separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H717871122\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Airway assessment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary evaluation </strong>&ndash; Patients scheduled for spine procedures may have conditions that affect pulmonary function. Significant spinal deformity may result in restrictive respiratory physiology, with decreases in vital capacity and total lung capacity, and in some cases pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. Although rarely required, in addition to routine preoperative respiratory assessment, pulmonary function testing and arterial blood gas analysis may be indicated for patients having complex spine procedures, especially for thoracic spine procedures requiring a thoracotomy and use of a double lumen endotracheal tube. Results may help predict the effects of one lung ventilation and thereby help plan the surgical approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiovascular evaluation</strong> &ndash; Cardiovascular compromise may be the result of the pathology for which spine surgery is being performed, such as pulmonary hypertension in patients with severe kyphoscoliosis. In addition, many patients presenting for spine surgery are unable to exercise and cannot provide functional assessment. Preoperative cardiac evaluation should take into account both patient factors and the invasiveness of the planned surgery. When evaluating cardiac perioperative risk, most spine surgeries involving fusion and instrumentation should be classified as intermediate-risk procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. One- or two-level decompression without fusion is classified as low-risk. Preoperative cardiac evaluation is discussed more fully separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most spine surgery is performed in the prone position, which is associated with reduction of cardiac index of 12 to 24 percent compared with supine, the result of reduction of venous return and left ventricular compliance in the prone position. Therefore, the degree of preexisting cardiac dysfunction may affect decisions about anesthesia technique and monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H101148328\" class=\"local\">'General anesthesia'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H606892008\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Specific comorbid conditions, particularly pulmonary hypertension and congestive heart failure, are highly associated with perioperative adverse events after spine surgery, and surveillance for these conditions should occur in the preoperative evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Musculoskeletal</strong> <strong>evaluation</strong> &ndash; Some patients having spine surgery have coexisting conditions that make surgical positioning challenging. The patient should be asked about range of motion of joints prior to anesthesia, as limitations may affect decisions about positioning. Skin should be examined and bruises or signs of injury documented preoperatively. (See <a href=\"#H606892008\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neuromuscular evaluation</strong> &ndash; Existing motor and sensory neurologic deficits should be recognized and documented prior to surgery. Knowledge of existing deficits is essential for accurate surveillance and diagnosis of new postoperative deficits. Existing motor deficits may impact both the choice of neuromuscular blocking agent and the site of assessment of the extent of neuromuscular blockade. (See <a href=\"#H606892036\" class=\"local\">'Neuromuscular blocking agents'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory evaluation </strong>&ndash; Existing comorbidities and invasiveness of the anticipated procedure should dictate preoperative laboratory evaluation. Laboratory testing is usually unnecessary for single-level decompressive procedures performed in patients with limited comorbid disease. We perform a baseline hemoglobin, platelet count, serum creatinine and blood bank type and screen for surgical procedures that involve more than two vertebral levels, vertebral fusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> instrumentation, or require osteotomies. If significant blood loss is expected, consultation with the blood bank may be required in advance of surgery if the type and screen shows antibodies that will delay cross match.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preoperative autologous blood donation</strong> &ndash; Preoperative autologous blood donation (PAD) is not routine but can be considered for patients scheduled for spinal surgery expected to result in more than 500 to 1000 mL blood loss. PAD as well as options for intraoperative blood conservation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Preoperative autologous blood donation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Blood salvage&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H349560944\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative blood salvage'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478155409\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General anesthesia is most commonly used for spine surgery, but regional anesthesia is an option for one- or two-level lumbar laminectomy or disc surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101148321\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional anesthesia has been used for lumbar discectomy and laminectomy. Though epidural anesthesia is occasionally used, more commonly spinal anesthesia is an acceptable alternative for selected patients without contraindications to its use, and when the surgeon agrees. Contraindications to spinal anesthesia include patient refusal, severe spinal stenosis, history of intracranial hypertension, coagulopathy, systemic infection or infection at the site of needle placement, arachnoiditis, and severe hypovolemia.</p><p>Spinal anesthesia for lumbar surgery can be performed with a variety of techniques and medications. It can be done in the sitting or lateral position using isobaric or hyperbaric local anesthetic, with or without the addition of narcotic or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>. Our usual practice is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We consider spinal anesthesia for patients who will tolerate lying prone for the duration of surgery after assessing the patient's level of anxiety and range of motion of the neck, shoulders, and arms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally avoid spinal anesthesia for patients for whom we would anticipate difficult airway management; should an airway emergency occur, the patient may have to be turned supine and the airway rapidly secured. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H717871210\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Prediction of the difficult airway'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After routine monitors are applied, spinal anesthesia is performed as usual under sterile technique using a pencil point spinal needle (eg, 25 gauge Whitacre, 24 gauge Sprotte) in the sitting position, though the lateral decubitus position may be used in some cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neuraxial anesthesia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We inject 3 mL of 0.5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> over 5 to 10 seconds, with the dose modified according to patient factors (eg, height, age, body mass index).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is positioned prone on chest supports, arms on armboards, padded and abducted to &lt;90 degrees. (See <a href=\"#H606892008\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients are lightly sedated with either small doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> (eg, 1 to 2 mg) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> as necessary, aiming to avoid respiratory depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate level of anesthesia is confirmed prior to skin preparation to allow for change in anesthetic plan if necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If necessary, the surgeon supplements the anesthetic with a subarachnoid injection of 1 mL of 0.5 percent isobaric <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> using a pencil point spinal needle under direct vision in the surgical field.</p><p/><p>Several randomized trials have compared regional anesthesia with general anesthesia for lumbar microdiscectomy or laminectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. No clear difference in morbidity or mortality has been identified, though several short-term benefits of regional anesthesia have been demonstrated. A literature review of 11 trials comparing general with regional anesthesia for lumbar surgery showed modest reduction in hypertension and tachycardia, reduction in postoperative pain, and reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similarly, a metaanalysis of eight randomized controlled trials that compared spinal with general anesthesia for lumbar spine surgery reported reductions in intraoperative hypertension and tachycardia, analgesic requirement in the post anesthesia care unit, and nausea and vomiting in the first 24 postoperative hours, with spinal anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101148328\"><span class=\"h2\">General anesthesia</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478155416\"><span class=\"h2\">Premedication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premedication should be chosen as it would be for patients having other types of surgery. Some general considerations include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedatives and narcotics should be titrated to effect; patients having spine surgery are often taking opioid medication for pain and may require higher doses of narcotics as part of premedication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If flexible fiberoptic intubation is planned, we administer an anticholinergic medication, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> 0.2 mg intravenously (IV) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> 0.4 mg IV, to dry secretions for patients who will tolerate the tachycardia that may result.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If multimodal pain control is planned, preoperative administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> 1000 mg orally (PO) or IV, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> 300 to 600 mg PO, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> 75 to 150 mg PO, with doses adjusted for older patients and for those with renal dysfunction, may be indicated.

For multilevel spinal fusion, instrumentation, and tumor surgery, we place two large bore intravenous (IV) catheters (14 or 16 gauge) or a rapid infusion catheter. We use a fluid warmer in the line connected to the largest IV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343689913\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard monitors (blood pressure monitoring, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, end expired carbon dioxide, and temperature) are used for all patients having general anesthesia. The decision to employ a more advanced monitoring technique depends on the patient's medical status, the expected length of surgery, and the anticipated blood loss. An arterial catheter may be placed for close blood pressure monitoring or for repeated blood sampling and is used for most major spine procedures, such as multilevel fusion and tumor surgery.</p><p>Central venous or, rarely, pulmonary artery catheter placement may be necessary for patients who will require high-level cardiac monitoring or central administration of vasoactive medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606892143\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The strategy for airway management for general anesthesia for spine surgery depends on the expected degree of difficulty with mask ventilation, supraglottic airway device ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and the stability of the cervical spine.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Awake versus asleep intubation</strong> &ndash; Endotracheal intubation before induction of anesthesia (awake intubation) is indicated for the patient at high risk of aspiration of gastric contents if intubation is difficult, when all methods of airway management are likely to be difficult, and when neurologic assessment after intubation is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults#H3654913958\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Awake intubation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Choice of intubation technique </strong>&ndash; The choice of airway technique or device for intubation is generally determined by the expertise of the clinician and the availability of airway devices. Use of a familiar technique by an experienced clinician is most likely to succeed. While the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope is most commonly used for awake intubation, increasingly video laryngoscopes are used for intubation after induction for patients with difficult direct laryngoscopy. Strategy for airway management for general anesthesia, flexible fiberoptic intubation, and techniques for difficult airway management are discussed more fully separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For most patients, a single-lumen endotracheal tube will be adequate for airway protection, ventilation, and anesthetic delivery. The lateral approach to the thoracic spine via a thoracotomy incision may require lung isolation with a double-lumen endotracheal tube or a bronchial blocking device. When a double-lumen endotracheal tube is used, it may be replaced by a single-lumen tube if postoperative ventilation is required.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606892030\"><span class=\"h2\">Induction agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induction of anesthesia with IV medication is suitable for most patients scheduled for elective spine surgery. Occasionally, induction is performed with inhalation of a volatile anesthetic. This technique is used in adults with difficult intravenous access or when maintenance of spontaneous ventilation is preferred.</p><p>When neuromonitoring is planned for spine surgery, inhalational agents can significantly decrease the amplitude and increase the latency of evoked potential responses. Inhalational agents should be used with caution, if at all, for induction of anesthesia for cases requiring neurophysiologic monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H478155476\" class=\"local\">'Neurophysiologic monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>The most common IV induction agents used to achieve unconsciousness and apnea are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methohexital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methohexital</a>, a short-acting barbiturate, may be used in selected circumstances (eg, for patients with egg allergy).

Choice of NMBA for intubation and relaxation during surgery must take into account the plan for neuromonitoring, if applicable. (See <a href=\"#H478155476\" class=\"local\">'Neurophysiologic monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nondepolarizing NMBAs</strong> &ndash; The commonly used nondepolarizing NMBAs <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vecuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vecuronium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atracurium</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisatracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisatracurium</a> are intermediate-duration NMBAs. Onset and duration depend on the dose, but for typical intubating doses, onset of paralysis occurs in three to five minutes, and recovery to 25 percent of baseline twitch height occurs in 30 to 45 minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114271\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114271 \">table 1</a>). If neuromonitoring is not planned, nondepolarizing NMBA can be used for intubation, to facilitate surgical positioning, and for muscle relaxation during surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Depolarizing NMBA</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Succinylcholine</a> is a depolarizing NMBA with onset of action of an intubating dose (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV) within 60 seconds, and though recovery is variable, appreciable neuromuscular function returns within six to eight minutes. When neuromonitoring is planned, succinylcholine may be used for intubation, with no further NMBA administered, to allow for baseline motor testing within a few minutes of intubation. However, succinylcholine is contraindicated for some patients who are likely to present for spine surgery, such as patients with some neuromuscular disorders (eg, muscular dystrophies) and significant denervation lesions. Use of succinylcholine in such patients can cause severe, potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia. Duration of action of succinylcholine may be markedly prolonged in patients with atypical or low serum concentrations of pseudocholinesterase, the plasma enzyme that metabolizes succinylcholine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Remifentanil</a><strong> intubation </strong>&ndash; Remifentanil, an ultra-short-acting narcotic, is particularly useful for intubation for cases with contraindications to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> and when the prolonged duration of action of nondepolarizing NMBAs is undesirable. For a high-dose remifentanil intubation, the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> (2<strong> </strong><span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV) plus remifentanil (4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> IV) provides good to excellent intubating conditions at 2.5 minutes after induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Doses should be adjusted for older patients and those with comorbidities. We give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> (10 mg IV) along with the propofol for this type of induction to avoid the profound bradycardia and hypotension that may result from this dose of remifentanil.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606892008\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient position for spine surgery depends on the spinal level and the surgical approach. The surgical plan may require repositioning during the procedure. Goals of positioning are the avoidance of injury to the eyes, peripheral nerves, and bony prominences, as well as maintenance of low venous pressure at the surgical site. If neuromonitoring with motor evoked potentials is to be used, bilateral bite blocks should be placed between molars after intubation, making sure the tongue and lips will not be injured with jaw clench. Bite blocks should be taped in place and rechecked once the patient is turned prone. Warming blankets should be used as the surgical site permits.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cervical spine surgery &mdash;</strong> The patient's arms are usually tucked at the sides for cervical procedures. Anterior procedures are usually done with the patient's head on a padded head rest. For posterior cervical procedures or for procedures requiring intraoperative traction, the Mayfield device with skull pins is often used. The endotracheal tube should be securely taped out of the way of the surgical field. Eyes should be protected from pressure and covered with occlusive dressings or tape.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When arms will be tucked at the sides, either in the supine or prone positions, adequate intravenous (IV) access should be obtained prior to final positioning. Plastic IV clamps should be removed, and rigid IV tubing connectors should be padded prior to arm tuck. After the arms are tucked, IV flow should be confirmed. The arms and hands should be padded in anatomic positions with gel or foam positioning devices, making sure there is no pressure on the ulnar groove at the elbow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cervical spine procedures are rarely performed in the sitting position. If the sitting position is planned, the patient should be monitored for venous air embolism with precordial Doppler or transesophageal echocardiography, and central venous catheter should be placed for possible air aspiration. Venous air embolism is discussed more fully separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-craniotomy#H8564488\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for craniotomy&quot;, section on 'Management of venous air embolism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thoracic spine surgery &mdash; </strong>The anterior approach to spine surgery requires a thoracotomy with the patient in the lateral position. A double-lumen endotracheal tube may be required to allow deflation of one lung for surgical exposure. Posterior thoracic spine surgery is done in the prone position with the head on a foam or gel head rest, in the horseshoe head rest of the Mayfield apparatus, or with skull pins. Depending on the level of the surgery, arms will be either tucked at the sides or placed with the shoulders at 90 degrees with the arms on arm rests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lumbar spine surgery &mdash; </strong>The anterior approach to the lumbar spine requires a laparotomy, which is done in the supine position, while posterior procedures require the prone position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The prone position &mdash; </strong>Posterior procedures are usually performed with the patient in the prone position. Most patients are anesthetized on a stretcher while supine and then rolled prone onto the operating table after intubation. Prior to the turn the eyes are covered with tape or clear plastic adhesive dressing, bite blocks are placed, and an oral or nasal temperature probe is placed, as is an orogastric tube, if necessary. If the patient's head is to be supported on a foam headrest, the headrest is placed over the patient's face while supine, making sure that the eyes and nose are free in the respective openings in the device, and turned in place. After turning prone and frequently during surgery the eyes, nose, and periorbital areas should be checked to make sure they are not compressed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In anticipation of the turn, we administer 100 percent oxygen to prevent desaturation while ventilation is interrupted. Intravenous tubing and arterial line transducer tubing should be positioned along the patient's side to avoid dislodgement while turning. Monitoring cables may be disconnected for the turn but should be replaced as soon as possible. We maintain either pulse oximetry or invasive blood pressure monitoring throughout the turn and positioning whenever possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Turning the patient should be coordinated among the anesthesia care provider, the surgeon, and the other individuals helping with positioning. The breathing circuit should be disconnected at the last possible moment and for as briefly as possible. During the turn, the patient's neck should be kept in a neutral position. The arm on which the patient is rolling over should be along the patient's side throughout to prevent injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Special attention should be paid to the endotracheal tube when positioning prone. The tube can move in or out and can kink with positioning, especially if the neck is flexed for surgical exposure. After turning prone, the ability to ventilate, bilateral breath sounds, and blood pressure should be confirmed immediately before the stretcher is taken out of the operating room, on the chance that a quick return to the supine position might be necessary. Once the patient is prone, the breathing circuit should be supported to avoid traction on the endotracheal tube. We usually use an elastic tourniquet to tie the elbow of the breathing circuit to the bed frame, making sure that the endotracheal tube is supported in a way that does not pull on the lips. If repositioning during surgery is planned, the endotracheal tube and circuit must be protected from dislodgement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For lumbar and lower thoracic surgery in the prone position, arms may be tucked at the sides or placed in the &quot;prone superman&quot; or &quot;surrender&quot; position. Peripheral nerve injury related to arm position is rare, but one study found reversible upper-extremity somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) changes in up to 7 percent of patients with arm abduction versus 2 percent with arms at the sides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Ninety degrees or less of arm abduction without tension on the shoulder musculature should be the goal when positioning prone. Hips and knees should be slightly flexed and supported on pillows or pads, without pressure on the fibular heads. The face, ears, breasts, iliac crests, and genitalia should be positioned to avoid compression and padded if appropriate. If a Foley catheter is in place, it should be hanging free after positioning without traction on the genitalia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prone positioning can result in variable effects on cardiovascular physiology. Most commonly, there is a reduction in cardiac index, which has been attributed to reduction in venous return to the heart and reduced left ventricular compliance as a result of increased intrathoracic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Abdominal compression in the prone position can cause vena caval compression, reduction in venous return with resultant hypotension, venous stasis, and increased pressure in the epidural venous plexus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Reduced intraabdominal pressure is directly correlated with reduced blood loss during spine surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There are a number of padding systems, surgical frames, and operating tables used for prone positioning. Regardless of the type of frame used, those that allow positioning so that the abdomen is free from compression and maintain or reduce intraabdominal or bladder pressure are associated with reduced blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478155434\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance of anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like many surgical procedures, a balanced anesthetic approach consisting of a volatile or intravenous anesthetic with intravenous opioid administration is safe and effective for spine surgery.

The severity of blood loss increases with increased number of spinal levels fused, age over 50, obesity, surgery for tumors, increased intraabdominal pressure in the prone position, and the performance of transpedicular osteotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].

For most patients, we prefer using a restrictive transfusion strategy (ie, giving less blood, transfusing at a lower Hgb level, and aiming for a lower target Hgb level) rather than a liberal transfusion strategy (ie, giving more blood and transfusing at a higher Hgb level). For most hemodynamically stable medical and surgical patients, we suggest considering transfusion at a Hgb of 7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Some patients may tolerate a lower Hgb level.

In orthopedic surgical patients, the use of the lysine analogs <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> (TXA) and epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) are effective when administered as a single dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and when used in multiple dose regimens (ie, multiple boluses or bolus plus infusion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The available literature regarding the use of these agents and their dosing regimen in spine surgery is limited, and antifibrinolytic benefits related to a given drug and its dosing regimen are likely surgical procedure specific. Recommendations presented here are based on available meta-analyses and pharmacokinetic properties of the antifibrinolytic medications.</p><p>In spine surgery patients, both TXA and EACA have been shown to consistently reduce estimated blood loss, the need for transfusion, and the total amount of blood transfused when compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. There is insufficient evidence to recommend an ideal time to stop the infusion (end of skin closure or extension into the postoperative period).

Acute normovolemic hemodilution is a blood conservation technique that entails the removal of blood from a patient shortly after induction of anesthesia, with maintenance of normovolemia using crystalloid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> colloid replacement. The amount of blood removed varies between one and three units (450 to 500 mL constitutes one unit), although larger volumes may be withdrawn safely in certain circumstances. The blood is infused into the patient during or shortly after the surgical procedure.</p><p>The principle behind intraoperative hemodilution is that fewer red blood cells are lost during surgery because the hemoglobin of the shed blood is lower. This technique is safest when used in a healthy young adult who starts with a relatively high hemoglobin level and can tolerate anemia. It may be useful for Jehovah's Witness patients who may consent to the technique if the blood is maintained in a closed-circuit system.</p><p>The effect of intraoperative hemodilution on reduction of allogeneic transfusion is likely to be small. Intraoperative hemodilution is discussed more fully separately.

Induced hypotension has historically been advocated as a mechanism to reduce blood loss during a variety of surgical procedures. Reduced wound blood flow as a result of lower arterial blood pressure has been the mechanism cited for reduction in blood loss. However, epidural venous plexus pressure and intraosseous pressure, both important determinants of blood loss in spine surgery, are independent of arterial blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The most important reason to avoid the use of induced hypotension is the potential for end-organ ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/25,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,32</a>]. In particular, patients with severe spinal stenosis are at risk for spinal cord ischemia and should be maintained during anesthesia at or near their usual blood pressure. In addition, spinal instrumentation and distraction can reduce spinal cord perfusion and result in ischemia. Therefore, adequate arterial blood pressure should be maintained during instrumented spinal surgery as one measure to avoid neurologic damage.</p><p>In addition, visual loss is a rare but potentially devastating postoperative complication of prone spinal surgery. Ischemic optic neuropathy is the most common cause of postoperative visual loss associated with spine surgery. Although the causes of ischemic optic neuropathy have not been fully elucidated, tissue edema with reduced perfusion of the optic nerve is a suggested etiology. Use of deliberate hypotension has not been associated with the development of postoperative visual loss; however, optimization of hemodynamics with maintenance of perfusion pressure of the optic nerve is recommended.

Intraoperative blood salvage complements other methods of blood conservation and may be particularly useful in patients who are expected to have substantial intraoperative bleeding but are unable to donate autologous blood prior to surgery. Some Jehovah's Witnesses who will not accept blood transfusion will accept autologous blood transfusion with a closed collection and administration system. Given the high cost of current technology, it becomes cost effective compared with allogeneic blood transfusion when &ge;2 units of blood can be salvaged and reinfused.

Airway and facial edema commonly occur during long procedures in the prone position and with administration of large volumes of intravenous fluid. The patient with significant airway edema is at risk for airway obstruction after extubation. The decision to extubate must take into account the duration of surgery, blood loss and fluid replacement, the surgical procedure performed as it relates to the potential for airway compromise, and patient factors such as obesity or sleep apnea that make airway obstruction more likely.</p><p>Though specific patient and surgical factors affect the decision to extubate, in general our approach to extubation after spine surgery is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have had general anesthesia for one- or two-level decompression in the prone position are routinely extubated at the end of the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have had surgery lasting more than four hours in the prone position are assessed after turning supine at the end of the procedure. If there is significant facial edema, extubation may be delayed, even for a short period in the operating room. The patient is positioned with the head elevated to 30 degrees to allow edema to recede. When the patient is extubated, if there has been significant edema we extubate over a tube changer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have had surgery in the prone position with significant blood loss (&gt;2000 mL); large volume resuscitation with crystalloid, colloid, and blood products; or who have had anterior-posterior spine surgery remain intubated and receive postoperative care in the ICU.</p><p/><p>Retrospective studies have shown correlation between operative duration, intravascular volume replacement, obesity, and number of levels of spinal surgery and the decision to delay extubation at the end of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. Most patients who required delayed extubation after spine fusion procedures will be extubated in the first 24 hours postoperatively. However, even a limited period of postoperative mechanical ventilation is associated with a higher incidence of postoperative pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Some procedures confer especially high risk of postoperative airway edema, such as anterior-posterior cervical spine surgery. These procedures usually last more than eight hours, with the majority of the procedure performed with the patient in the prone position. In addition, these procedures can result in &gt;1000 mL blood loss and involve surgery and tissue dissection on structures around the airway. All of these factors make airway edema more likely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556312057\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative disposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with limited comorbid disease undergoing uncomplicated decompressive procedures may be candidates for short-stay or even outpatient surgery. Patients having more complex spinal surgery require inpatient, and in some cases ICU, postoperative care. Morbidity and mortality after spinal fusion can approach 23 and 0.5 percent, respectively, and up to 10 percent of lumbar spine fusion patients will require care in an ICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Factors independently associated with increased morbidity after spine surgery include advanced age, male gender, and increased comorbidity burden. Specific comorbid conditions highly associated with perioperative adverse events include pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and presurgical coagulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Long procedures (longer than five hours), combined <span class=\"nowrap\">anterior/posterior</span> spinal procedures, and some procedures involving only the anterior spine, particularly anterior thoracic procedures, are associated with increased perioperative complications and mortality when compared with posterior spine procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/5,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349561356\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478155476\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurophysiologic monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioperative neurologic injury is a feared complication of major spine surgery. Multimodal intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM), including motor evoked potential (MEP), somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP), and electromyography (EMG), is often used to monitor spinal cord function during surgery on the cord or the vertebral column. Multimodal IONM is recommended for spine surgery where the spinal cord or nerve roots are deemed to be at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>While neurologic injury can cause changes in recorded potentials, other factors can interfere with interpretation. Confounding factors that can occur during surgery include inhalational anesthetics, hypothermia, hypotension, hypoxia, anemia, and preexisting neurologic lesions. Inhaled anesthetics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> can reduce the amplitude and prolong the latency of SSEP and can completely abolish MEP. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) also abolish motor evoked potentials and cannot be used when monitoring. Intravenous anesthetics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, barbiturates, and opioids have less of an effect on monitoring, though very deep anesthesia, even with propofol, can affect waveforms.</p><p>Neuromonitoring during surgery and anesthesia, and anesthetic strategy during neuromonitoring, are discussed more fully separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia#H3106240\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromonitoring in surgery and anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Anesthetic effects on neuromonitoring'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia#H426643280\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromonitoring in surgery and anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Anesthetic strategy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478155482\"><span class=\"h2\">Visual loss after spine surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visual loss after spinal fusion surgery is a rare but devastating complication with a reported incidence of 0.017 to 0.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. The major causes of visual loss in this patient population include ischemic optic neuropathy (ION), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). CRAO and RVO are attributed to embolic load <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> direct globe compression, emphasizing the need to protect the eyes from direct pressure while in the prone position.</p><p>ION almost universally results in permanent visual loss. In 2012, the Postoperative Visual Loss (POVL) Study Group reported the findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>] of their multicenter case control study that used data from known ION cases registered in the American Society of Anesthesiologists POVL Registry and control cases from 17 United States academic medical centers. Independent risk factors for the development of ION include male sex, obesity, use of the Wilson frame (head lower than the heart), longer anesthetic time, greater estimated blood loss, and lower percent of colloid in the nonblood fluid replacement. Using these risk factors and the reported incidence of POVL from ION in the literature, the POVL Study Group created a risk prediction model that may help surgeons and anesthesia providers modify their care plans and define the risk of ION to patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Risk modification strategies for ION after prone spine surgery should include positioning with the head level with or above the heart, minimizing anesthetic duration and blood loss; the use of both colloids and crystalloids for intravascular volume replacement; monitoring hemoglobin periodically during cases with significant blood loss; and optimization of hemodynamics with maintenance of blood pressure within 20 percent of baseline. Patients scheduled for historically lengthy (longer than four hours) spine surgery in the prone position should be informed of the small but increased risk of ION [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

Depending on the planned procedure, the anterior portion can include ureteral stenting, laparotomy, colonic and vascular mobilization, bony exposure, and osteotomies. The posterior portion, again depending on the surgery, can include tumor resection and spinal stabilization procedures.</p><p>The anterior and posterior portions of these procedures can be done sequentially during one anesthetic or can be staged with the two approaches performed days apart. Literature comparing outcomes during and after staged or sequential spine procedures is conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/73-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-77</a>]. Planning for these potentially long and complicated procedures requires collaboration between surgery and anesthesia, including plans for postoperative care, giving consideration to staging spine procedures in an effort to reduce prolonged procedures with significant blood loss. A collaborative approach has been endorsed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists and the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society and supported by the North American Spine Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-spine-surgery-in-adults/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556311871\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General anesthesia is most commonly used for spine surgery. Regional anesthesia is possible for one- or two-level decompression or discectomy. For patients who will tolerate lying prone, for whom we do not anticipate difficulty with airway management, and with a willing surgeon, we sometimes administer spinal anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H101148321\" class=\"local\">'Regional anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway management may be difficult for patients having spine surgery, who may present with instability of the cervical spine, decreased range of motion of the neck, or conditions that distort airway anatomy. Video laryngoscopy, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and, occasionally, awake intubation may be required. (See <a href=\"#H606892143\" class=\"local\">'Airway management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthetic agents and neuromuscular blocking agents affect neuromonitoring for spinal surgery. If somatosensory and motor evoked potential monitoring is planned, we suggest total intravenous anesthesia rather than inhalational anesthesia. For these patients, we also use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a> for intubation rather than longer-acting agents to allow monitoring within minutes of intubation. (See <a href=\"#H478155476\" class=\"local\">'Neurophysiologic monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood loss may be significant or even massive for some spine procedures. We place two large bore intravenous catheters or a rapid infusion catheter and use invasive monitoring (eg, arterial line) for long procedures and for those in which we anticipate significant blood loss. For all patients having prone spine surgery, patients should be positioned to minimize intraabdominal pressure as a measure to reduce blood loss. For patients undergoing spinal fusion, we suggest administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> or epsilon <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminocaproic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminocaproic acid</a> and the use of intraoperative cell salvage (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H530945982\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous access'</a> above and <a href=\"#H343689913\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H349560884\" class=\"local\">'Antifibrinolytics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H349560944\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative blood salvage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positioning for surgery should be meticulous, avoiding abdominal compression and pressure on eyes, bony prominences, peripheral nerves, breasts, and genitalia. The head should be positioned level with or above the level of the heart whenever possible to reduce venous congestion and edema of the face, airway, and periorbital tissues. (See <a href=\"#H606892008\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain after one- or two-level decompressive procedures may be controlled with a relatively low-dose opioid along with other analgesics. For patients undergoing major spine surgery, pain may be severe and may require a multimodal approach to pain control. We administer preoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and use intraoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> in addition to opioids. We administer intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a>, in consultation with the surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H478155440\" class=\"local\">'Analgesia for major spine surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The plan for postoperative care for patients having major spine surgery may include delayed extubation and intensive care, especially after long procedures with significant blood loss and large-volume fluid resuscitation. We delay extubation in patients at risk for edema and airway obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H349561436\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative visual loss is a rare but devastating complication of prone spinal fusion.
