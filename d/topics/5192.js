However, the availability of serologic testing for celiac disease and the common use of upper endoscopy has complicated the definition, since these tests have identified patients who appear to have the disease but have variable degrees of histopathologic changes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms. Thus, several categories of celiac disease have emerged (asymptomatic, silent [ie, asymptomatic and no evident malabsorption or other disease manifestations], potential [ie, positive celiac-specific serology with normal histology]). Whether these phenotypes are clinically useful remains to be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The natural history of these various forms of celiac disease is incompletely understood. In particular, the long-term risk of complications in patients who are asymptomatic is unclear. Such patients may also be least likely to comply with a gluten-free diet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will focus on the use of serum antibodies in the diagnosis and management of celiac disease. This topic is also discussed in guidelines issued by several organizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The recommendations in this topic are largely consistent with a consensus statement from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and with the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHO SHOULD BE TESTED</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for celiac disease should be considered in the following adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with gastrointestinal symptoms including chronic or recurrent diarrhea, malabsorption, weight loss, and abdominal distension or bloating.

Our recommendations are consistent with the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, screening for celiac disease in the absence of suggestive signs or symptoms of celiac disease is controversial. This is reflected in a United States Preventative Services Task Force report that concluded that there are insufficient data to support screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>Guidelines do not recommend screening for celiac disease in patients with osteoporosis since the prevalence of celiac disease is not significantly increased among the patients with osteoporosis. However, this conclusion was not supported by a subsequent study published after the consensus conference in which the prevalence of celiac disease in 260 men and women with osteoporosis was compared with 575 controls without osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The prevalence of biopsy-proven celiac disease was significantly higher in the osteoporosis group (3.4 versus 0.2 percent). Most patients had biochemically evident secondary hyperparathyroidism with vitamin D deficiency. Furthermore, all but one had other clinical features suggestive of celiac disease including anemia, weight loss, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, until further data are available, screening patients with osteoporosis for celiac disease should probably be confined to those with additional clinical or laboratory features suggestive of the disorder and those with known risk factors for celiac disease (eg, a positive family history, auto-immune thyroid disease or type 1 diabetes mellitus).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An approach to diagnosis of celiac disease is summarized in the following algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89796\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89796 \">algorithm 1</a>). All testing should be performed while patients are on a gluten-rich diet. No single test can confidently establish the diagnosis of celiac disease in every individual. As a result, the most important initial step in diagnosis is recognition of the many clinical features that can be associated with the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Serologic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a general rule, testing should begin with serologic evaluation. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibody is the single preferred test for detection of celiac disease in individuals over the age of two years. </p><p>When there exists a high probability of celiac disease (&gt;5 percent), total IgA should be measured, especially if IgA based serology is negative (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Individuals with a moderate or high risk for celiac disease'</a> below). An alternative approach is to include both IgA and IgG-based testing, in particular, IgG-deamidated gliadin peptides (DGPs), in patients with a high probability of celiac disease. In patients in whom low IgA or selective IgA deficiency is identified, IgG-based testing (preferably IgG DGP) should be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Testing on a gluten-free diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Celiac disease should be differentiated from nonceliac gluten sensitivity in order to identify the risk for nutritional deficiency, complications of celiac disease, and to determine the necessary degree and duration of adherence to a gluten-free diet. The diagnosis of celiac disease also has important implications for family members who may be at risk for celiac disease and associated disorders. While there are limited data with regard to the decrease in antibody titers in individuals on a gluten-free diet, a weakly positive test may become negative within weeks of strict adherence to a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>An approach to diagnosis of celiac disease in patients on a gluten-free diet is summarized in the following algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F85570\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85570 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. Baseline antibody testing (IgA anti-tTG or IgA endomysial antibody and IgG anti-DGP [if available]) should be performed in patients on a gluten-free diet. Patients with positive serology should undergo a small bowel biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel biopsy'</a> below.) </p><p>Patients on a gluten-free diet with negative serologies should undergo HLA <span class=\"nowrap\">DQ2/DQ8</span> testing to determine if the patient is genetically susceptible to celiac disease. If HLA <span class=\"nowrap\">DQ2/DQ8</span> testing is negative, celiac disease is excluded. </p><p>Patients who are positive for HLA <span class=\"nowrap\">DQ2/DQ8</span> and patients who have a positive serology, but normal or nondiagnostic histology while on a gluten-free diet, should undergo a modified gluten challenge (3 g <span class=\"nowrap\">gluten/day</span> for two weeks) and, if tolerated, a full gluten challenge (3 g <span class=\"nowrap\">gluten/day</span> for an additional six weeks) followed by a duodenal biopsy. Serology (anti-tTG or IgA endomysial antibody and anti-DGP) should be checked at the end of the gluten challenge and, if negative, serology should be repeated two to eight weeks later. </p><p>Patients who opt to continue on a strictly gluten-free diet without undergoing formal gluten challenge may be managed in a similar fashion to those with known celiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F85570\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85570 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Small bowel biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a positive serology, and patients with a high probability of celiac disease (&gt;5 percent), regardless of the serology, should undergo an upper endoscopy with small bowel biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89796\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89796 \">algorithm 1</a>). Exceptions are those who have biopsy-proven dermatitis herpetiformis in whom the diagnosis can be established without a small bowel biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Individuals with a moderate or high risk for celiac disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The duodenal mucosa may appear atrophic with loss of folds, contain visible fissures, have a nodular appearance or the folds may be scalloped (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65969\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65969 \">picture 1</a>), but such findings are not universally present and may be seen with other disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60030 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Staining techniques and high resolution magnification endoscopy can help identify areas of villous atrophy for biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Video capsule endoscopy may reveal visible features of celiac disease in the more distal small intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wireless-video-capsule-endoscopy#H3736713505\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wireless video capsule endoscopy&quot;, section on 'Small bowel tumors, polyps, and other pathology'</a>.) </p><p>The histologic features range from a mild alteration characterized only by increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), to a flat mucosa with complete loss of villi, enhanced epithelial apoptosis, and crypt hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. The histologic findings in celiac disease can be described using the Marsh-Oberhuber and Corazza classifications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89797\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89797 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Quantitative histology (villous height, crypt depth, density of IELs per 100 enterocytes) provides the most sensitive and accurate method to monitor disease activity over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis is presumptively established when there is concordance between the serologic results and the biopsy findings. It is confirmed when clinical manifestations resolve subsequently on a gluten-free diet. Demonstration of histologic normalization is not always required; indeed, many patients show persisting partial villous atrophy despite adherence to the gluten-free diet and symptom improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Suggestive clinical features but negative serologic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four main possibilities in those with suggestive clinical features but negative serologic tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The individual may have selective IgA deficiency. In such patients, testing for IgG deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies should be performed. Other, less accurate, IgG-based tests include IgG anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IgG endomysial antibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The individual may already be on a low gluten diet. An approach to diagnosis of celiac disease in patients on a gluten-free diet is summarized in the following algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F85570\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85570 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Testing on a gluten-free diet'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serologic test (IgA-tTG) could be falsely negative. This is more common in patients with mild disease on histology. IgA or IgG deamidated gliadin peptide antibody testing may be useful. However, a small bowel biopsy is needed to make a diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient may not have celiac disease in which case other causes of symptoms (eg, irritable bowel syndrome, nonceliac gluten sensitivity or wheat allergy) or of villous atrophy should be considered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60030 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61019\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61019 \">algorithm 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with a wheat allergy have negative celiac serologies and normal duodenal biopsies or an eosinophilic enteritis, but an IgE serology and skin prick test to wheat are positive. Patients with nonceliac gluten sensitivity have negative celiac serologies, normal or near normal duodenal biopsies, and negative IgE serology and skin prick test to wheat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergens: Overview of clinical features and cross-reactivity&quot;, section on 'Grains'</a>.)</p><p/><p>There are occasional patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear despite the above. Such patients can undergo testing for HLA haplotypes associated with celiac disease. More than 99 percent of patients with celiac disease have HLA DQ2 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> DQ8 compared with about 40 percent of the general population. Thus, celiac disease is highly unlikely in patients without these haplotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Positive serologic tests but negative small bowel biopsies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgA tTG serology may occasionally be positive but the small intestinal biopsy normal. </p><p>False positive tTG results are rare but do occur and are usually low titer (typically less than twice the upper limit of normal). Repeating the test using an assay that uses human tTG as the capture antigen may resolve the discrepancy since older tTG tests using non-human tTG have more frequently been associated with false positive results. The intestinal biopsy should be reviewed by a pathologist familiar with celiac disease to look for subtle abnormalities of celiac disease.</p><p>If these two steps do not reconcile the results, the patient can be placed on a high gluten diet and, after 6 to 12 weeks, numerous additional biopsies obtained from multiple sites in the mid and distal duodenum since celiac disease enteropathy can be patchy and missed due to sampling error. As noted above, staining techniques and high resolution magnification endoscopy can help identify areas of villous atrophy for biopsy. Some patients have a positive serologic test and only mild histologic changes supportive of celiac disease. Patients with mild villous atrophy appear to benefit from a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Lymphocytic infiltration of the intestinal epithelium in the absence of villous atrophy is not specific for celiac disease and other causes should be considered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60030 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Potential celiac disease is defined by positive celiac-specific serologies with normal small intestinal histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This is most frequently encountered in patients screened for celiac disease due to a positive family history or a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hence, small intestinal biopsy is especially important in patients found to have an elevated IgA anti-TTG by screening. Symptomatic patients with potential celiac disease are likely to benefit from treatment with a gluten free diet. Asymptomatic patients can remain on a normal diet unless clinical features of celiac disease develop.</p><p>There may be a subset of patients with clinical features resembling irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who do not have a serologic or histologic profile diagnostic of celiac disease but who may respond symptomatically to a gluten-free diet. One study suggested that the presence of serum IgG antigliadin antibodies and expression of HLA-DQ2 may be predictive of such a response in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS but the strength of the association remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SERUM ANTIBODY ASSAYS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of serologic studies have been described to aid in the diagnosis of celiac disease, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgA endomysial antibody (IgA EMA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody (IgA tTG)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG tissue transglutaminase antibody (IgG tTG)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgA deamidated gliadin peptide (IgA DGP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG deamidated gliadin peptide (IgG DGP)</p><p/><p>Serum IgA endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibody testing have the highest diagnostic accuracy.

However, the newer anti-deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) assays described above show high diagnostic accuracy. IgA EMA, IgA tTG, IgA DGP and IgG DGP levels all fall with treatment; as a result, these assays can be used as a noninvasive means of monitoring the response to a gluten-free diet. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring adherence and response to gluten-free diet'</a> below.)</p><p>Serologic studies for celiac disease can be divided into two groups based upon their target antigens: anti-TTG and anti-gliadin antibody tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">IgA endomysial assay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endomysial antibodies bind to connective tissue surrounding smooth muscle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/30-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-37</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Clinical application of serologic tests'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to laboratory variation, the sensitivity of these tests may depend upon the severity of the disease. In one report, as an example, serum antibodies were determined in 101 patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The sensitivity of IgA endomysial antibodies varied from 100 percent in patients with total villous atrophy to only 31 percent in those with partial villous atrophy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of antibodies in disease pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antigliadin antibodies do <strong>not</strong> appear to be essential for the pathogenesis of celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Furthermore, many normal individuals have increased IgA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IgG antigliadin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. In contrast, IgA endomysial antibodies are rarely found in the absence of gluten-sensitive enteropathy. However, patients with celiac disease who lack these antibodies do not differ in their clinical presentation or response to gluten-free diet from those who are antibody positive. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to suggest that, in addition to cellular immunity, antibodies against tissue transglutaminase, the target autoantigen within the endomysium, are of some pathogenetic importance. Furthermore, tissue transglutaminase enzymatically alters gliadin peptides to increase their propensity to induce helper T-cell activation when presented by DQ2 or DQ8 on antigen presenting cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with celiac disease also have increased levels of serum antibodies against other food proteins such as beta-lactoglobulin, casein, and ovalbumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. It is not clear whether this reflects a general aberrant immune responsiveness to food antigens or results from enhanced systemic exposure to these proteins because of increased small intestinal permeability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATION OF SEROLOGIC TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three different clinical circumstances should be considered when using serologic studies in the diagnosis and management of celiac disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of individuals with a low pretest probability for celiac disease. Such patients may have undergone testing for celiac disease during evaluation of common disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, reduced fertility or osteoporosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of individuals with a moderate or high pretest probability for celiac disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring adherence and response to a gluten-free diet.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Individuals with a low risk for celiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the pretest probability of celiac disease is perceived to be low (ie, less than 5 percent), serologic studies are useful in excluding the diagnosis. Asymptomatic patients without a family history of celiac disease or laboratory or clinical evidence for malabsorption can be considered to be low risk. The patient's ethnicity may also help determine baseline risk. While celiac disease affects persons of many ethnic backgrounds, it is rare in those of purely Chinese, Japanese, or Sub-Saharan African descent.</p><p>In the low-risk setting, the IgA endomysial antibody test has the highest diagnostic accuracy but is a little more costly than the IgA tTG ELISA test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89796\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89796 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33</a>]. The antigliadin antibody tests have lower diagnostic accuracy.</p><p>As noted above, the serum IgA tissue transglutaminase and IgA endomysial tests have similar sensitivities. A negative result for either test has a high negative predictive value in this situation and may obviate the need for small bowel biopsy.</p><p>The IgG antigliadin test is less sensitive and therefore less useful. IgG antigliadin is usually positive in the 1 to 2 percent of celiac patients who have IgA deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Many clinicians test simultaneously for both IgA and IgG antigliadin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. This approach gives a small incremental increase in sensitivity but increases cost and leads to frequent false positive test results, especially with the IgG antigliadin test. As a result most experts advise against routine AGA testing. The newer DGP tests are more specific and may be used to supplement tTG testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. IgA tTG titers will be very low in patients with celiac disease and IgA deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. IgG DGP is the most accurate diagnostic test in patients with IgA deficiency.</p><p>The specificities of the IgA endomysial and IgA tissue transglutaminase tests are high. Thus, their positive predictive values are high even in low-risk populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/33,34,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34,37</a>]. In contrast, the specificities of IgA and IgG antigliadin tests are lower, and positive results have a low positive predictive value in low-risk populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/34,58,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,58,64</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Screening in asymptomatic individuals'</a> below.)</p><p>In summary, a positive IgA tissue transglutaminase or endomysial antibody test is highly specific (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89796\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89796 \">algorithm 1</a>). The standard antigliadin antibody tests have lower diagnostic accuracy and are no longer recommended because they yield many false positive results (15 to 20 percent of subjects tested) leading to unnecessary endoscopy with biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Individuals with a moderate or high risk for celiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the pretest probability of celiac disease is perceived to be high (ie, greater than 5 percent), diagnosis is based upon serologic tests and histology. Celiac disease is frequently associated with dermatitis herpetiformis, Down syndrome, selective IgA deficiency, and other conditions that have autoimmune features such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, and autoimmune liver disease. Patients with these conditions or a family history of celiac disease can be considered as being at increased risk. Patients with suggestive clinical features such as severe diarrhea, weight loss, or persistent anemia can also be considered to be at high risk.</p><p>The standard approach has been to obtain a small bowel biopsy for histopathologic examination. However, the very high specificity of the IgA endomysial test has led to debate as to whether a positive result in the appropriate clinical setting can be considered diagnostic and eliminate the need for small bowel biopsy. We recommend performing both IgA endomysial (or TTG) and small bowel biopsy prior to dietary treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89796\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89796 \">algorithm 1</a>). This approach provides the best means of making a definitive diagnosis of celiac disease from the outset.</p><p>Antigliadin antibody tests are <strong>not</strong> helpful when there is a moderate or high probability of celiac disease. A positive or negative result will not alter the need for small bowel biopsy and definitive histologic diagnosis. Since antigliadin antibody tests have a high false positive rate there is no role for a trial of a gluten-free diet for presumed celiac disease based on the finding of an elevated antigliadin antibody level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring adherence and response to gluten-free diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic testing is also useful in monitoring the response to gluten-free diet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Monitoring the response to a gluten-free diet'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING IN ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening studies suggest that the incidence of celiac disease in whites of northern European ancestry and in many other populations may be as high as 1:100 to 1:250. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The benefit of population screening for asymptomatic celiac disease, usually using the IgA endomysial or IgG tTG (transglutaminase) assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/34,37,57,58,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,37,57,58,65</a>], has not yet been demonstrated. The potential advantages of screening for asymptomatic celiac disease include a reduction in risk for enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma or other malignancies, a reversal of unrecognized nutritional deficiency states, resolution of mild or ignored intestinal symptoms, avoidance of other autoimmune disorders, an improvement in general well-being, and a possible reduction in mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These issues were addressed in a 2009 report from the Mayo Clinic in which serum was tested for endomysial antibodies and, if positive, for tTG in almost 22,000 individuals from different time periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 9133 healthy young adults at an Air Force base in Minnesota in whom blood was obtained between 1948 and 1954, 14 (0.2 percent) had substantially elevated IgA anti-TTG. At a follow-up of 45 years, these individuals had a significant increase in mortality compared to those who were seronegative (hazard ratio 3.9).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of seropositivity was fourfold higher in samples obtained in a Olmsted County cohort that was matched for age at sampling or had similar years of birth. The rate of undiagnosed celiac disease was 4.0 to 4.5 times higher than in the original cohort (0.8 to 0.9 versus 0.2 percent), suggesting a dramatic increase in prevalence since ~1950.</p><p/><p>The possible benefits of screening and subsequent therapy depend upon compliance with an exacting, sometimes expensive, dietary regimen. Asymptomatic individuals may not be sufficiently motivated to adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. There may also be adverse psychological effects when asymptomatic individuals receive a diagnosis of a chronic incurable condition that demands substantial lifestyle changes.</p><p>For these reasons, widespread screening of asymptomatic individuals is not generally advocated at this time, even in populations in which the prevalence of celiac disease is high. This must be distinguished from testing to diagnose celiac disease in patients with subtle clinical manifestations in which instance the value of serologic tests as diagnostic aids is widely accepted.

HLA testing is useful in ruling out celiac disease due to its high negative predictive value. A systematic review of the literature estimated that testing for these haplotypes had a sensitivity of 90 to 95 percent but specificity was only around 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

For patients who are already on a gluten-free diet, an approach to diagnosis of celiac disease is summarized in the following algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F85570\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85570 \">algorithm 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgA deficiency is more common in celiac disease (2 to 5 percent) than in the general population (&lt;0.5 percent). The IgA EMA and IgA tTG serology tests will be falsely negative in untreated celiac disease in patients with IgA deficiency. As a result, total serum IgA can be measured in addition to IgA EMA or IgA tTG especially when there is heightened clinical suspicion for celiac disease and IgA markers are negative. If total IgA levels are abnormally low, an IgG-based assay should be used to test for celiac disease. The IgG antigliadin assay has been traditionally used in this circumstance but is not ideal since it yields frequent false positive results. The serum IgG DGP test is the preferred IgG-based assay. IgG tTG or IgG EMA are also available but are less sensitive. Negative results upon testing for HLA DQ2 or DQ8 can also help exclude the diagnosis in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Serum antibody assays'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to serologic markers, the diagnosis usually requires a small bowel biopsy, which can be obtained during upper endoscopy. Exceptions are patients with compatible serologic findings and biopsy-proven dermatitis herpetiformis in whom the diagnosis can be established without a small bowel biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A hallmark on histology is the presence of villous atrophy. However, villous atrophy can be patchy, and may also be present in a variety of other disorders that should be considered in appropriate clinical settings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60030 \">table 1</a>). Four to six duodenal biopsies should be obtained to maximize the likelihood of detecting villous atrophy. Duodenal bulb biopsies have been advocated to increase diagnostic sensitivity. However, the added value is not clear and specificity may suffer. Bulb biopsies, if taken, should be clearly labeled as such to help ensure that the pathologist takes into account the different mucosal architecture of the bulb to avoid false positive reports of villous atrophy. The accuracy of biopsies can be improved with staining techniques and magnification endoscopy; however, these approaches are not used routinely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnification-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnification endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A few controversies remain regarding confirmation of the diagnosis. Some authorities recommend that a repeat small intestinal biopsy should be obtained approximately 24 months after beginning a gluten-free diet to demonstrate histologic improvement. Some also recommended a repeat small bowel biopsy (after gluten rechallenge) following a gluten-free diet. We do not believe that these approaches are generally required unless the diagnosis remains uncertain based upon the serologic profile, histology, and clinical response.
