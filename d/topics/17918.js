Although the symptoms that herald recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer are nonspecific, most women will have symptoms, with the most common consisting of bleeding (which emanates from the vagina, bladder, or rectum), anorexia, weight loss, bone or pelvic pain, cough, shortness of breath, or lower abdominal or extremity swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>However, recurrent endometrial cancer presents with different patterns, including disease localized to the vagina, limited to the pelvis, or as metastatic disease involving the abdominal cavity or other organs. In addition, some women may initially present with de novo metastatic disease (ie, stage IVB). For women suspected of recurrent or metastatic disease, confirmation of this diagnosis is important, particularly if the diagnosis is being considered for the first time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195349296\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women suspected of recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer, the diagnostic work-up should include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic examination with biopsies of areas suspected of recurrent disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical exam, with attention to nodal regions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whole body imaging to evaluate for metastatic disease &ndash; Imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can be performed using computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emissions tomography (PET) scan, or a combined PET-CT scan. In general, computerized tomography (CT) is usually the initial study. If CT results are equivocal, further evaluation using positron emissions tomography (PET) scan or a combined PET-CT scan may be indicated. Ultimately, the choice between these imaging modalities is dependent on institutional practice. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of cancer antigen (CA) 125 &ndash; Measurement of serum CA 125 may be useful in the diagnostic work-up of a suspected recurrence, particularly in women that had an associated elevation in their CA 125 at the initial diagnosis. However, the level of CA 125 alone should not influence treatment decisions.</p><p/><p>Additional studies may include testing the tumor for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor expression, especially in endometrioid cancer. In addition, overexpression of human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) is performed at some centers, particularly in patients with uterine serous cancer. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195349302\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with a diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic disease have a poor prognosis, regardless of treatment. In addition, unlike in the setting of a new diagnosis, data suggest that histology does not predict treatment response in these patients. This was shown in a retrospective study of over 1200 women who participated in first-line chemotherapy trials (all of which tested an anthracycline-containing combination) conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The main finding was that histologic subtype did not predict response to first-line chemotherapy. However, specific histology subtypes were associated with outcomes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear cell carcinoma was an independent predictor of poorer progression-free survival</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serous and clear cell histologies were significant predictors of overall survival</p><p/><p>Despite these data, it is still possible to cure selected patients with isolated disease with an aggressive local or regional approach. Therefore, our approach to treatment varies by the clinical scenario:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with recurrent disease isolated to the vaginal vault are potentially curable. Choices for treatment depend on whether radiation therapy (RT) was previously administered. (See <a href=\"#H2110942881\" class=\"local\">'Isolated vaginal recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with locally recurrent disease limited to the pelvis are also potentially curable. Treatment options include surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RT, provided they are appropriate candidates for this. For women who are not candidates for a local therapeutic approach, we proceed with medical treatment as we would for women with metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H2110942854\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence limited to the pelvis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5234213\" class=\"local\">'Patients who develop metastatic disease'</a> below.) <br/><br/>Women with disease outside of the pelvis either at their initial presentation or at the time of recurrence have metastatic endometrial cancer. In most cases, treatment is not curative. Therefore, the approach should be individualized. (See <a href=\"#H297984019\" class=\"local\">'Patients with metastases at initial presentation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The posttreatment surveillance of women with endometrial cancer is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endometrial-carcinoma#H11157097\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endometrial carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Posttreatment surveillance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2110942881\"><span class=\"h1\">ISOLATED VAGINAL RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have undergone a hysterectomy for endometrial cancer are at risk for a recurrence at the vaginal vault, although treatment with adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) decreases this risk. </p><p>This was demonstrated in the Postoperative Radiation Therapy after Endometrial Cancer (PORTEC) randomized trial that included 715 women with stage I endometrial cancer who underwent total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without lymphadenectomy, and were then assigned to adjuvant RT or no further treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Women treated with adjuvant RT had a lower incidence of vaginal recurrence at eight-year follow-up (2 versus 8 percent), without a difference in overall survival. Further results of the PORTEC trial are discussed separately. &#160;</p><p>For those who develop an isolated vaginal recurrence, the local treatment approach takes into account whether or not prior RT was administered: </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2110943027\"><span class=\"h2\">No prior radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with an isolated vaginal recurrence of endometrial cancer who were not previously treated with RT, we suggest RT rather than surgery. However, surgery alone can be a curative and reasonable alternative to RT in carefully selected patients, including those women who decline RT or are not candidates for RT. (See <a href=\"#H197827773\" class=\"local\">'Operative candidates'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10110332\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data regarding treatment of an isolated vaginal recurrence are limited, but outcomes appear favorable based on observational studies and the few studies of surgical treatment for this patient population. Two retrospective case series (n = 50 and 69) evaluated women with endometrial cancer, nearly all of whom had not received prior RT, following an isolated vaginal recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Treatment with RT was associated with a five-year overall survival rate (OS) of 53 to 75 percent. &#160;</p><p>In addition, in the PORTEC I trial described above, 30 women who were not initially treated with RT had a vaginal recurrence and were subsequently treated with curative intent; most received whole pelvic RT with or without brachytherapy (28, although three women were treated with RT and surgery or RT and hormonal therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The complete response rate for all women treated with curative intent was 87 percent. &#160;</p><p>The role of concurrent chemotherapy with RT is investigational and, in our practice, we do not offer combined modality treatment. We encourage women in this situation to enroll in a randomized trial being conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00492778&amp;token=YbJELcAW9G3aZfZrjTwgllXLsXNNrpAr426VqXdy7dLetASEU9VsbvqyGOWgTMh3GP7ZG5lNofh/3/T3tNTipA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7096\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">GOG 238</a>), which randomly assigns these patients to RT with or without concurrent sensitizing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2110943071\"><span class=\"h2\">Prior radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although vaginal recurrences are less common in women treated with prior RT, they are associated with a poor prognosis. In the PORTEC trial, there were only seven vaginal recurrences out of 354 women treated with RT (eight-year recurrence rate, 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the actuarial OS rate at three years among these patients was 43 percent. </p><p>Treatment options among these women depend on whether or not they are candidates for surgery:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197827773\"><span class=\"h3\">Operative candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with a vaginal recurrence who have been previously treated with RT and who are operative candidates (complete resection is technically feasible and can tolerate surgery), we suggest surgical resection rather than additional RT or medical therapy. Pelvic exenteration is the mainstay of surgical therapy for a vaginal recurrence. Although a radical resection of locally recurrent disease (eg, vaginectomy) may be a less morbid alternative to a pelvic exenteration, it should only be offered to carefully selected patients in whom the chances of cure will not be compromised. &#160;</p><p>Pelvic exenteration is an extensive procedure with a substantial risk of short- and long-term morbidity, including urinary and bowel dysfunction and sexual dysfunction. Urinary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> colonic diversions are typically required. In general, we restrict surgery to women in whom a complete resection of disease is technically feasible and who are able to tolerate surgery and are willing to accept the functional postoperative changes. Patients who are candidates for surgery should be thoroughly counseled about the details of the procedure, risks, recovery, and future changes in functioning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenteration-for-gynecologic-cancer#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exenteration for gynecologic cancer&quot;, section on 'Patient selection'</a>.)<br/><br/>Data on the outcomes of women following pelvic exenteration for recurrent endometrial cancer are limited. No studies have compared surgery with additional RT or chemotherapy, although use of these options in this patient population has not been well studied and these are regarded as options of last resort. In many case series, women with pelvic sidewall disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positive pelvic or paraaortic lymph nodes were included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. As a result, the reported five-year OS rates range from 14 to 50 percent. The largest series included 44 women with recurrent endometrial cancer; the median OS after pelvic exenteration was 10.2 months and five-year OS was 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Details of the procedure of pelvic exenteration for gynecologic cancer are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenteration-for-gynecologic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exenteration for gynecologic cancer&quot;</a>.) &#160; </p><p>Following surgery for an isolated vaginal recurrence, we initiate surveillance rather than offering further treatment, provided there was no evidence of metastatic disease identified at surgery or by postoperative imaging. Women with evidence of metastatic disease should receive further treatment. (See <a href=\"#H297984019\" class=\"local\">'Patients with metastases at initial presentation'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2328420\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonoperative candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with an isolated vaginal recurrence who are not candidates for surgery for whatever reason, medical treatment is usually the only treatment option. In general, reirradiation is not an option for women with a vaginal recurrence, particularly after pelvic radiation, given the risks to the normal surrounding tissue. However, if the technical skills are available, the administration of tailored RT into a previously irradiated area may be reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This approach should take into account the increased complexity associated with designing the field of treatment and the possible risks to surrounding normal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. <br/><br/>In a case series of 27 patients treated with stereotactic RT after conventional RT, there were no serious (grade 3, 4, or 5) toxicities associated with re-treatment, and a 96 percent symptomatic response (measured by reduced tumor size, decrease in pain, or decrease in bleeding) was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Unfortunately, the experience with tailored RT approaches is limited and expertise may not be available in many places to allow consideration of this approach. </p><p>For women who are not candidates for either a surgical or RT approach, we offer medical treatment using a similar approach to women who develop metastatic disease. For women who maintain a good performance status, we encourage the participation in clinical trials. (See <a href=\"#H5234213\" class=\"local\">'Patients who develop metastatic disease'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2110942854\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENCE LIMITED TO THE PELVIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to women with recurrent disease involving the pelvic structures (vagina, lower urinary tract, rectosigmoid colon, pelvic sidewall) is the same as outlined above for women presenting with an isolated vaginal recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H197827773\" class=\"local\">'Operative candidates'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2110942881\" class=\"local\">'Isolated vaginal recurrence'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who were not previously treated with radiation therapy (RT), we suggest RT rather than surgery. For women who decline RT or are not candidates for RT, surgical resection is a reasonable alternative. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a pelvic recurrence and no distant metastases who have been previously treated with RT and who are operative candidates (complete resection is technically feasible and can tolerate surgery), we suggest surgical treatment. </p><p/><p>Despite surgery for a pelvic recurrence, these patients remain at a high risk for relapse. Therefore, as opposed to patients who undergo a successful resection of a local vaginal recurrence, those who undergo resection for a pelvic recurrence should be offered adjuvant chemotherapy. Based upon the results of the Gynecologic Oncology Group 209 (GOG 209) trial, our preferred regimen is six cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>. The results of this study are discussed below.

(See <a href=\"#H5234213\" class=\"local\">'Patients who develop metastatic disease'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H297984019\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITH METASTASES AT INITIAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p>For women with metastatic endometrial cancer, surgical cytoreduction is a reasonable treatment option, particularly if they are newly diagnosed and a complete resection appears feasible. Unfortunately, high-quality data are lacking for cytoreduction for endometrial cancer. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Pretreatment evaluation, staging, and surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'Cytoreduction'</a>.)</p><p>For women who undergo surgical cytoreduction of metastatic disease, we administer first-line chemotherapy in the postoperative (or &quot;adjuvant&quot;) setting. The administration of postoperative chemotherapy in this setting is extrapolated from the benefits of treatment for women with newly diagnosed, high-risk endometrial cancer. Based on the results of the Gynecologic Oncology Group 209 (GOG 209) trial, our preferred regimen is six cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>.

The two most commonly used regimens to treat metastatic endometrial cancer are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> or the triple drug combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, plus paclitaxel (TAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

However, given that currently available treatments are palliative, we encourage the participation in clinical trials.
