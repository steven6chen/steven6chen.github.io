Groups A, B, and C cannot be distinguished biochemically; <em>S. sonnei </em>can be differentiated from the other serogroups by the expression of ornithine decarboxylase. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440124009\"><span class=\"h2\">Stool culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Shigella</em> is cultured by techniques that are routine for the handling of stool in most clinical microbiology laboratories. Initial inoculation should be on more than one low selectivity medium, such as MacConkey or eosin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> (EMB). Colonies that appear suspicious on low selectivity media are usually subcultured onto highly selective media such as SS (<em>Salmonella</em>-<em>Shigella</em>), XLD (xylose-lysine-deoxycholate), HE (hektoen enteric), or deoxycholate citrate agar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81081\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81081 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>All the above media contain lactose, as well as a color indicator. <em>Shigella</em> do not ferment lactose (they are lactose non-fermenters). At 24 hours, lactose-negative colonies are picked and inoculated onto triple sugar iron agar or lysine iron agar slants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57505\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57505 \">picture 2</a>). <em>Shigella</em> colonies give an alkaline slant, acid at the bottom, and no gas or hydrogen sulfide production. In the setting of possible exposure to <em>S. dysenteriae</em> 1 (eg, travel to an endemic area such as Southeast Asia or the Indian subcontinent), the use of more than one selective medium is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Suspicious colonies can be further tested for motility and certain biochemical characteristics. <em>Shigella</em> are non-flagellated and are therefore non-motile.

Both the proteins that are secreted and the proteins that constitute the secretion apparatus are encoded on a large virulence plasmid carried by all virulent strains of <em>Shigella</em>.

Stx is genetically and structurally similar to the Stx1 and Stx2 toxins produced by certain <em>E. coli</em> strains, such as enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7, and the incidence of hemolytic uremic syndrome among infected children is similar to for the two pathogens. In the United States, these Stx-producing <em>E. coli</em> are the major cause of postdiarrheal hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The prominent renal involvement suggests that <em>Shiga</em> toxins may have a predilection for the renal circulation.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Shigella</em> organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than many other bacteria. For this reason, the inoculum required for the development of clinical disease is quite low; as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In developed countries, most cases of <em>Shigella</em> are transmitted by fecal-oral spread from people with symptomatic infection. In developing countries, both fecal-oral spread and contamination of common food and water supplies are important mechanisms of transmission. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Shigella</em> are nonmotile, facultatively anaerobic, gram-negative rods. There are four species of <em>Shigella</em>: <em>Shigella dysenteriae</em>, <em>Shigella flexneri</em>, <em>Shigella boydii</em>, and <em>Shigella sonnei</em>. In developing countries, <em>S. flexneri</em> is the predominant species; <em>S. sonnei</em> is the second most prevalent. Most cases of shigellosis in the United States are caused by <em>S. sonnei</em>; <em>S. flexneri</em> is the next most frequent isolate. <em>S. dysenteriae</em> 1 (the <em>Shiga bacillus</em>) was the most common isolate both in Europe and the United States in the early 1900s but is now rare. In the United States <em>S. dysenteriae</em> 1 infection is generally limited to imported cases from Mexico and Central America. (See <a href=\"#H440124002\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of <em>Shigella </em>infection involves invasion of colonic mucosal cells and induction of an intense inflammatory response, leading to the death of epithelial and immune cells and the formation of colonic mucosal ulcerations and abscesses. <em>Shigella</em>-induced macropinocytosis occurs through extensive rearrangements of the host cell cytoskeleton that cause formation of large extensions of the host cell membrane, in which the bacteria become engulfed. Thereafter, the bacteria spreads from host cell to host cell without having contact with the contents of the intestinal lumen. (See <a href=\"#H440125800\" class=\"local\">'Colonic entry'</a> above and <a href=\"#H440125807\" class=\"local\">'Macropinocytosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H440125846\" class=\"local\">'Cytoskeletal signaling'</a> above and <a href=\"#H440125861\" class=\"local\">'Spread to adjacent cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>S. dysenteriae</em> 1 can cause the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, mediated by <em>Shiga</em> toxin (Stx). Stx is genetically and structurally similar to the Stx1 and Stx2 toxins produced by certain <em>Escherichia coli</em> strains, such as enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7.
