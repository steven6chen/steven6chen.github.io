As cancer treatments have evolved, patients once considered incurable are sometimes seen as potentially curable.</p><p>As an example, this has led to a &quot;stage migration&quot; from stage IV to earlier stages of disease in some cancers. For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple tumors in the same lobe are now classified as T3, and multiple tumors in the same lung but in a different lobe are classified as T4, where they were once considered metastatic.</p><p>For patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IV NSCLC with one or a limited number of metastases, an emerging approach has been to use definitive treatment modalities to render them disease free.</p><p>This chapter reviews the basis of the oligometastatic state and discusses outcomes among patients with oligometastatic NSCLC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31557941\"><span class=\"h1\">THE OLIGOMETASTATIC STATE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66228989\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical state of oligometastasis consists of patients with metastases limited in number and organ site(s) who may have a more indolent biology and progression at existing sites without widespread metastases. This concept was best elucidated in 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], even though patients with limited metastases had been aggressively treated with surgical resection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy for many decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>According to this concept, locally ablative treatment directed to known metastases could render patients disease free, possibly for a protracted interval. This notion was supported by data demonstrating that approximately 25 percent of appropriately selected cancer patients with limited metastases, regardless of site, who received treatment to all known metastases achieved long-term survival. The eighth edition Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system (effective in the United States as of January 1, 2018) distinguishes between patients with a single extrathoracic metastasis and those with multiple such metastases, reflecting that some patients with oligometastatic disease may receive more aggressive local therapy in addition to systemic treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Outside of the United States, the UICC implemented the eighth edition changes as of January 1, 2017. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66228126\"><span class=\"h2\">Criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Presumably there is a relationship between increasing number of metastases and diminishing efficacy of local therapy. A particular challenge in defining the oligometastatic state is determining what specific criteria constitute &ldquo;disease limited in number and location.&rdquo; Published studies generally use specific criteria (eg, solitary, &le;3, &le;5) in order to establish study eligibility, but other factors are probably also important, such as the volume, histology, genetics, and location of tumor.</p><p>The expected toxicity risks of potential treatment are also important in categorizing a patient as having oligometastatic disease. With ablative radiation, three or five lesions have been used as a cut-off in many studies because radiation to more lesions might increase toxicity risks. In a patient with more than five lesions and low volume disease, ablative radiation might still be feasible, which is now often done in patients with brain metastases; surgery may still be possible in some circumstances, such as hepatic lobectomy containing more than five metastases. However, it cannot be presumed that the principles of oligometastatic disease apply simply because of the feasibility of local therapy; the rationale for local therapy to treat multifocal and asymptomatic disease becomes less justifiable as the number <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bulk of lesions to treat increases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66228108\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oligometastatic state can occur in several different settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who presented with limited metastases at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with multiple metastases who are rendered oligometastatic from an effective response to systemic treatment which &ldquo;eradicated&rdquo; most metastases but failed to destroy one or a limited number of treatment-resistant tumor foci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oligorecurrence occurs in patients who have undergone curative intent treatment to locoregional disease which remains controlled in the setting of new metastatic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oligoprogression occurs when one or a limited number of metastases recur or progress while systemic therapy continues to control the primary site and most areas of metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Such a situation has been frequently observed in the setting of acquired resistance to targeted therapies after a prolonged tumor response. In this setting, ablation of all metastases could potentially eradicate the metastases resistant to systemic therapy, allowing for continued delivery of systemic agents that are providing clinical benefit at other sites.</p><p/><p>Whether or not the outcomes between these clinical situations differ with respect to tumor response or survival is not clear. In this review, all clinical scenarios with metastases limited in number and extent are considered as &ldquo;oligometastases.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66228615\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR TREATMENT OF OLIGOMETASTASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with oligometastatic NSCLC do not always progress to widespread metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Therefore, there may be appropriately selected patients with respect to disease <span class=\"nowrap\">bulk/burden</span> and number of metastases who can be treated with metastasis-directed surgical or ablative procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12335569\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic therapy is the standard palliative treatment for NSCLC patients presenting with metastatic disease or relapsing to distant sites. In studies, which predominantly include patients with widespread metastases, systemic therapy has been shown to improve overall survival and maintain long-term quality of life. Systemic therapy is also used for locoregionally advanced NSCLC as a component of definitive management of unresectable disease amenable to radiotherapy and as adjuvant therapy after resection. </p><p>The benefit of systemic therapy for the unique subset of NSCLC patients with oligometastases amenable to resection or ablative therapies is not well understood, but in extrapolating from the benefit of systemic therapy for locoregionally advanced and metastatic NSCLC, systemic therapy is generally considered in the management of oligometastatic patients. </p><p>Different systemic therapy approaches may each define subsets of patients with oligometastatic disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted therapy &ndash; The limited subset of patients with an activating mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene or translocation in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene or ROS1 are now typically treated initially with specific inhibitors, and other potential targets are being identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Targeted therapy in these situations is associated with response rates of 60 percent or higher and a median time to progression of eight months or longer. This is often followed by very limited progression in a single focus of disease (either intracranial or extracranial), against a background of a still markedly lower tumor burden than was seen prior to initiation of targeted therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; For the population of patients who do not have an identified &ldquo;driver mutation,&rdquo; platinum-based chemotherapy doublets are modestly more effective than older regimens. For patients who progress after first line chemotherapy, additional systemic agents are less effective with response rates ranging around 10 percent with median survivals of seven to eight months &#160; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-therapy-for-the-initial-management-of-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-without-a-driver-mutation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic therapy for the initial management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer without a driver mutation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-subsequent-systemic-therapy-for-previously-treated-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Subsequent systemic therapy for previously treated patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chemotherapy for widely metastatic NSCLC is purely palliative. Chemotherapy also has an established role as adjuvant treatment for selected patients who have undergone resection of a primary NSCLC. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy before or after locally ablative treatment of oligometastatic NSCLC remains to be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant systemic therapy in resectable non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunotherapy &ndash; Immunotherapy does not currently have an established role in patients with NSCLC. However, promising results with checkpoint inhibitors in early trials suggest that such responses, which are often incomplete, may be relatively durable and that this may soon become an option. These patients may also eventually constitute a group suitable for treatment of oligometastatic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-of-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-with-immune-checkpoint-inhibition#H11313385\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer with immune checkpoint inhibition&quot;, section on 'Immune activation and checkpoint inhibition'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31557947\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence of oligometastasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oligometastasis is relatively common in NSCLC, although the precise incidence is not clear. Improvements in diagnostic imaging (eg, positron emission tomography [PET], <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/computed</span> tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) may allow detection of metastases in patients who otherwise have been thought to be free of metastases, or it may detect widespread metastases in patients thought to have oligometastatic disease. Data on the incidence of oligometastatic disease largely antedates the use of these newer imaging modalities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reanalysis of pretreatment imaging of patients with metastatic NSCLC treated on a phase II trial investigating the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> demonstrated that over 50 percent of patients had disease limited to the primary lung and nodal sites and &le;3 metastases confined to three or fewer organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

From a United States study, long-term follow-up of surgically managed early stage NSCLC patients found that greater than 50 percent of those eventually developing metastases do so in three or fewer locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A slightly lower rate of oligometastases (26 percent) was found when reviewing a prospective database of stage IV NSCLC patients presenting to a tertiary referral center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>These data are derived from surgical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy-based treatments, and it is unknown if oligometastatic state is more or less common in oncogene-driven NSCLC tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31557953\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history of oligometastatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In retrospective studies, the survival of patients with oligometastatic NSCLC is more favorable than in those with more numerous metastases (&gt;5), even without therapy specifically directed toward the metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. These observations may introduce a selection bias in retrospective studies. For this reason, an assessment of the value of local therapy requires prospective study</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A comprehensive analysis of patients treated on consecutive Southwest Oncology Group protocols demonstrated that a single metastasis was significantly associated with improved survival compared with multiple metastases in a single organ or multiple organ involvement (8.7 versus 6.2 and 5.1 months, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of 423 patients presenting with stage IV NSCLC from 2009 to 2012 found that the median survival was longer for patients with oligometastatic NSCLC (&le;5 distant metastases) compared with patients with more extensive disease (17 versus 14 months hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.53-1.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, median survival in 370 early-stage NSCLC patients who developed oligometastases was significantly longer than in those who developed diffuse metastases (12.4 versus 6.1 months, HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.69) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>Prolonged overall survival and prolonged relapse-free survival resulting from metastasis-directed therapy to NSCLC metastases may be achievable. Data from multiple institutions report median and overall survival after local therapy for oligometastases are comparable to those commonly reported for stage III NSCLC patients. Furthermore, a significant proportion of these patients achieve a long-term duration free of cancer. (See <a href=\"#H12336314\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes of curative intent treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66228437\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach is to offer ablative therapy to all known metastases in patients with good performance status, long disease-free intervals, and limited metastases (one to three sites). This is consistent with European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for oligometastatic NSCLC. Additionally, for patients who are not candidates for, or decline, systemic therapy, non-invasive ablative therapy can be considered as a means to afford control of the treated sites. Further progression after such therapy may be amenable to additional ablative treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may warrant reconsideration of systemic therapy.</p><p>Identification of the patients who are most likely to benefit from definitive treatment of oligometastases is of the utmost importance in deciding whether or not to offer metastasis-directed therapy. While many patients develop limited metastases from NSCLC, only a relatively small percentage (on the order of 15 to 25 percent) experience long-term disease-free intervals following ablative treatment to all known metastases. Selecting patients who have an increased likelihood of long-term disease-free intervals following treatment to all known gross metastases remains a significant challenge.</p><p>A meta-analysis using individual patient data identified several factors associated with worse overall survival, including synchronous rather than metachronous oligometastases, more extensive nodal involvement, and histology other than squamous cell or adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. For progression-free survival, significantly adverse prognostic factors included nonsurgical management of the primary NSCLC, presence of lung metastases, and presence of brain metastases.</p><p>Other analyses have found that improved overall survival in patients with identified oligometastatic NSCLC was associated with better performance status, limited nodal disease, presence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, and metastases limited to one organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Hypothesis-generating studies from a single institution identified specific microRNA from primary tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and metastases or pulmonary metastases alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], including NSCLC patients, that are associated with a better prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Further work is needed, specifically in NSCLC-only populations, to validate these biomarkers and to determine whether this is associated with a more favorable response to treatment of the oligometastases.</p><p>Prospective randomized data are needed to clearly ascertain who benefits from oligometastasis-directed local therapy, and what the quantifiable benefit is. In the absence of adequate randomized trials, clinical judgment is required in selecting acceptable oligometastatic and <span class=\"nowrap\">oligoprogressive/recurrent</span> patients for local therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66228384\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12336294\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary treatment options for definitive therapy of oligometastases are surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy. There are no studies comparing surgery versus radiation therapy in the management of oligometastatic disease. These approaches may also be combined with systemic therapy. Other ablative modalities do not have an established role but may be useful in selected cases.</p><p>The results suggest that stage IV NSCLC patients who present with solitary metastases (if localized to brain, adrenals, or lung) can be treated with curative intent. This requires individual assessment, taking into account the timing of appearance of metastasis relative to the primary tumor (metachronous having a better prognosis than synchronous disease), patient performance status and comorbidities, as well as local extension of the primary tumor.(See <a href=\"#H12336314\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes of curative intent treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12335828\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metastasectomy for oligometastatic NSCLC can be considered for any metastatic site. Studies specifically analyzing outcomes after resection of extracranial metastases from NSCLC are limited. Some studies also include patients receiving stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or other ablative therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,17</a>]. Many studies specific for metastasectomy for NSCLC include heterogeneous cohorts with respect to timing of metastases and metastatic sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/13,16-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16-23</a>], which often comprise a large percentage of patients with brain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/13,16,17,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,17,19-23</a>]. In a Japanese study of 93 patients (14 with brain metastases) who underwent resection of recurrent metastatic NSCLC, the two and five-year survival rates after recurrence were 44 and 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Over the last decade, the rate of metastasectomy for lung cancer patients is increasing, mainly driven by increasing resection for brain and adrenal metastases. These are being increasingly performed in patients with comorbid illness. Fortunately, over the same time period, perioperative mortality following metastasectomy is decreasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12336344\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-operative interventions are often preferred due to risks of surgical morbidity and mortality, as well as the comorbid conditions typical for NSCLC patients that limit their ability to tolerate an operative intervention. A number of studies have investigated radiation with or without chemotherapy to treat oligometastatic NSCLC as a non-invasive means of achieving tumor eradication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Most, but not all studies treating patients with oligometastatic NSCLC with radiation, similar to surgery studies, are retrospective. Furthermore, most have included various radiation dosing schedules including conventionally fractionated radiation therapy and stereotactic techniques for both intracranial and extracranial metastases.</p><p>Stereotactic techniques deliver a single or limited number of precisely targeted, high doses of radiation and are associated with high rates of local tumor control. The use of these technologies, developed originally for intracranial targets, has been extrapolated extracranially and are commonly termed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). SBRT in particular has become widely used for the treatment of limited metastases with increasing utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The benefit of chemotherapy in this setting is unknown; its use is extrapolated from data supporting adjuvant chemotherapy after resection in high-risk (ie, node positive) non-metastatic patients and from data supporting chemotherapy for palliation of patients with mostly widespread metastases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant systemic therapy in resectable non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12336314\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes of curative intent treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether the prolonged disease-free intervals and survival seen in some patients with oligometastases are a result of the treatment to all metastases or due to more indolent biology is unclear. Although available data suggest a benefit from treatment, most data come from small phase II studies or retrospective data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/16,24,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24,38,39</a>]. Our approach is to offer local management of metastatic disease to a select group with good performance status and limited metastatic disease (one to three metastatic sites). Although data are limited, local management of metastatic disease may improve distant control in properly selected patients and is being used clinically in many centers. Further studies are planned.</p><p>In a nonblinded, randomized phase II study including 49 patients with three or fewer metastatic sites after first-line therapy for metastatic NSCLC, those assigned to local consolidative therapy of residual metastatic or primary disease (SBRT, hypofractionated radiotherapy, or resection), with or without maintenance, experienced an improved progression free survival (PFS) relative to those assigned to maintenance therapy alone (11.9 versus 3.9 months, hazard ratio [HR] for death or progression 0.35, 90% CI 0.18-0.66) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Time to the appearance of a new lesion was also longer for those receiving local consolidative therapy (11.9 versus 5.7 months). Overall survival results are not yet mature. Approximately two-thirds of patients in this study had only primary disease or a single metastatic focus after first-line therapy, making it difficult to extrapolate these results to the more commonly observed clinical scenario, in which multiple metastatic sites are present.</p><p>Similarly, a prospective, single-arm, phase II trial used surgery or radiotherapy for the local treatment of 40 patients with one to five metastases from NSCLC. Most patients had a single metastatic lesion (87 percent), and 44 percent had brain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The two-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 14 and 23 percent, respectively.</p><p>Retrospective data suggest an improved outcome with local consolidative therapy. These have included patients with both synchronous and metachronous metastases, various sites of metastases (both intracranial and extracranial), and patients treated with multiple treatment modalities (surgery, conventional radiation therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> SBRT). For example, a retrospective series analyzed outcomes for 61 patients with one to three synchronous metastases (intra- and extracranial) from NSCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Most patients had a single metastasis (82 percent). Metastasis-directed treatments included surgical resection, conventional radiotherapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> SBRT. The two-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 8 and 38 percent, respectively. Smaller radiotherapy target volume and history of lung surgery were associated with longer survival. Despite these limitations of retrospective data, these types of studies provide indirect evidence that definitive therapy of all sites of disease can result in prolonged disease-free survival in a subset of patients. </p><p>The presence of intracranial metastases, even those limited in number and treated with ablative therapies, is associated with worse progression-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Two retrospective studies were limited to patients with NSCLC who were treated with radiotherapy for extracranial metastases only.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series, the five-year survival of 38 patients with up to eight metastases from NSCLC treated with SBRT was 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series reported on 25 patients with limited metastatic disease (&lt;5 sites, median 2) who were treated with SBRT.

Adverse prognostic factors included greater than two treated sites, prior systemic therapy, progression after systemic therapy, and non-adenocarcinoma histology.</p><p/><p>When treating newly diagnosed patients with an intact primary tumor, there appears to be a benefit to treating all sites of malignancy. For example, in one study, 78 patients with newly diagnosed oligometastatic NSCLC were treated with definitive radiotherapy to both the primary site and &le;5 metastatic sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Forty-two percent had brain metastases. For all patients, the one and three-year overall survival rates were 62 and 25 percent, respectively. Smaller tumor volume, better performance status, and a radiation dose &ge;63 Gy to the primary tumor were associated with improved overall survival. The site(s) of metastases were not prognostic.</p><p>Definitive treatment of the primary NSCLC tumor as well as sites of oligometastases is also supported by a systematic review that identified favorable prognostic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These included definitive treatment of the primary tumor and less nodal involvement (lower N-stage). Additionally, an individual patient meta-analysis indicated that patients treated with surgical management of the primary tumor in addition to all metastases had improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12336307\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific sites of oligometastases</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31557965\"><span class=\"h3\">Brain metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain metastases from NSCLC are common. Limited brain metastases can be managed aggressively with resection. The use and benefit specific therapy directed toward brain metastases has coincided with improved neurosurgical and radiosurgical techniques.

Patients who either underwent or did not undergo adrenalectomy were compared in these three studies. From the analysis of three studies, adrenalectomy with regional nodal clearance for adrenal metastases was advocated for &ldquo;otherwise early stage&rdquo; NSCLC, R0 resection, long disease-free interval, and no other evident metastases were favorable prognostic factors.

Because initial appearance of oligometastatic disease or oligoprogression may merely be a harbinger of subsequent diffuse metastatic disease, favorable outcomes with local therapy for metastatic disease are more likely if limited metastatic disease remains oligometastatic over time. In this setting, a course of systemic therapy may allow metastatic disease to &ldquo;declare itself&rdquo; as truly oligometastatic rather than oligometastatic prior to becoming more widely metastatic disease. Alternatively, ablative therapy while deferring systemic therapy until patients develop radiographically evident widespread metastatic progression can be considered.</p><p>A hypothesis-generating study of 25 patients with oligometastatic NSCLC treated to all metastases reported that prior systemic therapy was associated with worse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, with upfront ablative therapy the response to systemic therapy cannot be accurately gauged in patients whose disease remains controlled (ie, disease controlled from ablative therapy, systemic therapy, or both). For patients with oligoprogressive disease that developed while receiving molecularly targeted therapy, local treatment to progressing metastases has been shown to prolong the time to switching to alternative therapies, increasing the molecularly targeted agent&rsquo;s duration of effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligometastatic-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/36,37,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66228505\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The oligometastatic state in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is defined by a limited number of metastases in a limited number of organ site(s).
