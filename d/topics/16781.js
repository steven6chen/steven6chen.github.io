Unless identified by newborn screening, children with T-B-NK+ SCID present early in life with serious to life-threatening infections, failure to thrive, low to absent T and B cell numbers and function, and normal numbers and function of NK cells.</p><p>This form of SCID can result from autosomal recessive defects in any of several genes that encode proteins involved in antigen receptor gene V(D)J recombination. The recombination process randomly combines <strong>v</strong>ariable, <strong>d</strong>iversity, and <strong>j</strong>oining gene segments that encode T cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin genes in T and B cells, respectively. Some of the proteins encoded by these genes are also involved in DNA repair in all cells of the body. Defects in these genes are associated with extra-immune phenotypes, including growth and developmental abnormalities and heightened sensitivity to ionizing radiation and chemotherapy.</p><p>The pathogenesis and genetics of T-B-NK+ SCID diseases are reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of T-B-NK+ SCID are discussed in greater detail separately. An overview of SCID and the different forms of SCID are also presented separately.

V(D)J recombination is the process by which the immune system generates a vastly diverse repertoire of T and B cell receptors capable of recognizing a huge number of potential pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. These receptors contain variable domains that represent the recognition portion of each specific receptor molecule. The biology underlying V(D)J recombination is reviewed here. These processes are also discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-cell-receptor-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T cell receptor genetics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Recombination mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The coding regions of DNA for the variable domains of T and B cell receptor genes are assembled during the early stages of T and B cell maturation. This process involves site-specific DNA rearrangement to select one of each of a large tandem array of alternate segments of DNA called variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J). For every specific antigen receptor, there is a V and J gene segment and sometimes a D gene segment that are randomly selected and ligated together via a process called V(D)J recombination. Highly conserved sequences of DNA, termed recombination signal sequences (RSSs), flank all of the V, D, and J coding regions and facilitate this process.</p><p>In the initial step of V(D)J rearrangement, remodeling of the local chromatin structure brings the gene segments together into a complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71709\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71709 \">figure 1</a>). This is followed by the generation of precise DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at RSSs. These resulting signal ends (SE) are rejoined into what is termed a signal joint (SJ), while the coding ends (CE) are rejoined into a coding joint (CJ) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60698\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60698 \">figure 2</a>). The excised SJ fragments of DNA form what are called T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), which are an indicator of T cell production in the thymus. The measurement of TRECs in newborn dried blood spots is being used for newborn screening (NBS) for SCID. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-primary-immunodeficiencies#H114056766\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for primary immunodeficiencies&quot;, section on 'Screening for SCID and other T cell defects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7606609\"><span class=\"h3\">Recombination-activating gene (RAG) complex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>V(D)J recombination is initiated by the recombination-activating gene complex <span class=\"nowrap\">(RAG1/2)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71709\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71709 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The RAG1 and RAG2 proteins recognize RSSs that flank the V, D, and J segments in developing T and B cells, forming a stable protein-DNA complex termed the stable cleavage complex (SCC) that introduces DNA DSBs by a coordinated cleavage reaction.</p><p>Targeted mutations in mice in either of the RAG genes result in the arrest of T and B cell development due to the inability to initiate V(D)J rearrangements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. T cell maturation is arrested at the CD4-CD8- (double-negative [DN]) stage with no expression of T cell receptor (TCR) alpha-beta, TCR gamma-delta, or CD3. B cell development in the marrow is also blocked at an immature stage at the point at which immunoglobulin gene rearrangement is initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Homozygous animals have exceptionally small to absent thymuses and hypocellular spleens.</p><p>Cleavage at the SCC sites leaves a blunt SE and covalently sealed hairpin CE. The SE can potentially be directly ligated while the CE requires a processing step to open the hairpin and to add or delete nucleotides before the CE rejoining, further amplifying receptor diversity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonhomologous DNA end joining</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rejoining of both CEs is accomplished by a process that is also involved in DNA DSB repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The pathway of repair of these DSBs in eukaryotic organisms is called nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60698\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60698 \">figure 2</a>). NHEJ requires the modification of the two broken ends of DNA so that they are compatible with each other prior to rejoining. DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), Artemis, the Ku complex (Ku 86 and Ku 70), x-ray repair complementing defective, in Chinese hamster, 4 (XRCC4), DNA ligase IV, <span class=\"nowrap\">Cernunnos/XRCC4-like</span> factor (XLF), and nibrin are essential factors involved in V(D)J <span class=\"nowrap\">recombination/DNA</span> repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">DNA-PKcs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DNA-PKcs alone possesses certain DNA-binding and kinase activities and is associated with the NHEJ process of DNA repair. However, DNA-PKcs requires the involvement of Ku proteins to recruit it to DNA ends and stabilize its binding so that it is efficiently activated. In addition, alternative protein kinase pathways exist that can compensate in the DNA repair process when DNA-PKcs is missing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Ku proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Ku proteins constitute the major DNA end-binding activity in nuclear extracts from mammalian cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Other than recruiting and stimulating DNA-PKcs, Ku may also function in stabilizing broken DNA ends and bringing them together, as well as recruiting other components (terminal deoxytransferase [TdT] and the DNA ligase <span class=\"nowrap\">IV/XRCC4</span> complex) to the DNA ends to facilitate end joining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Impairment of lymphocyte development differs between Ku86- and Ku70-deficient mice, possibly indicating a subunit-specific Ku function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, both Ku 70- and Ku 86-deficient mice have impaired formation of coding and signal ends leading to ionizing-radiation sensitivity and lymphocyte developmental arrest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DNA ligase IV couples with XRCC4 to execute the final ligation of SJ and CJ ends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. XRCC4 has no known enzymatic activity, but functions as a scaffolding protein that helps attract other repair proteins to the DNA break. XRCC4 stabilizes DNA ligase IV and enhances its activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. DNA ligase IV is capable of ligating one DNA strand at a time. The targeted deletion in mice of either <em>XRCC4</em> or <em>LIG4</em> (the DNA ligase IV gene) leads to a pleiotropic phenotype including late embryonic lethality, severe impaired lymphocyte development, and massive apoptosis of newly generated neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Cernunnos/XLF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role(s) that the <span class=\"nowrap\">Cernunnos/XRCC4-like</span> factor (XLF) protein plays in V(D)J <span class=\"nowrap\">recombination/DNA</span> repair is still being elucidated.

This protein appears to play an essential role in gap filling that is required prior to ligation in the process of DNA DSB repair via the NHEJ pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Artemis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Artemis is a nuclear-based protein that underlies the pathogenesis of one type of T-B-NK+ SCID (Artemis-deficient SCID [ART-SCID]) and was initially referred to as radiation-sensitive SCID (RS-SCID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. It is encoded by the gene DNA cross-link repair protein 1C (<em>DCLRE1C</em>). The role(s) that Artemis plays in the later stages of V(D)J <span class=\"nowrap\">recombination/DNA</span> repair have not been completely delineated. However, it is known that Artemis is required for the maintenance of a normal DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The radiosensitivity and chromosomal instability seen in Artemis-deficient cells may be due to defects in cell cycle responses after DNA damage. In addition, Artemis is essential for CJ formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/3,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7607837\" class=\"local\">'Radiation-sensitive SCID'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H2362041889\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T-B-NK+ SCID: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Athabascan (SCIDA) phenotype'</a>.)</p><p>Artemis is also an effective phosphorylation substrate of DNA-PKcs, and it physically interacts with DNA-PKcs to form a strong complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Following complex formation, Artemis acquires exonuclease activity and is able to open synthetic hairpin structures and process the 3' ends of sequences.</p><p>In addition to T cell maturation arrest, mutations in <em>DCLRE1C</em> result in B cell differentiation arrest at the pre-B cell receptor checkpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. These defects have also been observed in mice with a targeted disruption of Artemis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4012706046\"><span class=\"h4\">Nibrin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nibrin is part of the meiotic recombination 11 (MRE11) complex, which has a role in the end-processing step in NHEJ along with Artemis and several other proteins described above. Nibrin is encoded by the Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (<em>NBS1</em>) gene. Defects in this gene result in a combined immunodeficiency called Nijmegen breakage syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Absence of nibrin in T cell precursors results in premature T cell development due to abnormal TCR beta coding and SJs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

The type depends upon whether the defective gene is involved in both V(D)J recombination and DNA repair or recombination alone.

Omenn syndrome is considered a T-B-NK+ SCID, although it is a &quot;leaky&quot; SCID with production of nonfunctioning T and B cells and therefore may appear to be T+B+NK+ SCID or a milder combined immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Somewhat leaky mutations of other SCID genes, including those encoding Artemis, the common gamma chain of the interleukin-2 receptor common gamma chain (IL2RG), DNA ligase IV, and interleukin-7 receptor alpha (IL7R-alpha) proteins, can also result in a clinical and immunologic phenotype that is indistinguishable from RAG-related Omenn syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H2362041877\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T-B-NK+ SCID: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Clinical variants'</a>.)</p><p>The majority of patients with Omenn syndrome have one nonfunctional RAG allele and a second, poorly functional allele or are homozygous for a poorly functional allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/37,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,42</a>]. These hypomorphic mutations in either <em>RAG1</em> or <em>RAG2</em> preserve some ability to accomplish V(D)J recombination. In an allelic series, the amount of recombinase activity correlated with diversity of the T and B cell receptor repertoire (the T cell receptor [TCR] repertoire is very restricted in most patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The residual RAG activity allows for production of oligoclonal T cells that are poorly regulated and cause adenopathy, infiltrative erythroderma skin rash, and eosinophilia. Later-onset phenotypes are seen when more RAG function is preserved, including those with autoimmune phenomena and T cell granulomatous skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], common variable immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], and even lupus erythematosus and autoimmune blood cytopenias such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/43,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,45</a>].</p><p>The unique clinical features of Omenn syndrome appear to be a result of activated T cells with a limited repertoire and dysregulated B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] suggestive of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), although skin histology is not consistent with GVHD and there is no evidence of maternal engraftment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

The discovery of the homozygous point mutation in multiple Navajo and Apache kindreds confirmed the founder hypothesis. It is important to recognize that Navajo and Apache children are susceptible to other types of SCID including RAG1, IL7 receptor-deficient SCID, and X-linked SCID. Thus it should not be assumed that a Native American child with suspected SCID has SCID-A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p>Hypomorphic mutations in genes for <em>LIG4</em>, DNA-PKcs (<em>PRKDC</em>), <span class=\"nowrap\">Cernunnos/XLF</span> (<em>NHEJ1</em>), and nibrin (<em>NBS1</em>) appear to result in a combined T and B cell immunodeficiency phenotype (CID) in which the clinical phenotype is less severe than typical SCID and can present as marrow failure without a significant infectious history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/8,10,21,40,52,53,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,21,40,52,53,64,65</a>]. Fibroblasts from patients with these conditions have increased sensitivity to radiation, suggesting an associated defect in DNA repair. Some <em>PRKDC</em> mutations result in DNA-PKcs that is still expressed but is defective in recruiting Artemis to the site of DNA damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics/abstract/8,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1303676825\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An extreme form of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) is the T cell-negative (T-), B cell-negative (B-), natural killer cell-positive (NK+) SCID phenotype, which accounts for 20 to 30 percent of all cases of SCID.

Defects in several of these pathways are associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">radiation/chemotherapy</span> sensitivity because some of the proteins encoded by these genes are also involved in DNA repair. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two principal types of patients with T-B-NK+ SCID associated with V(D)J recombination defects: those with and without radiation sensitivity (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Genetic defects and radiation sensitivity'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe mutations in recombination-activating gene 1 or 2 <em>(RAG1</em> or <em>RAG2)</em> genes result in T-B-NK+ SCID without radiation sensitivity.

This leads to partial impairment of V(D)J recombination and distinct clinical manifestations with a spectrum of autoimmune and immunodeficiency disorders known as Omenn syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The other type of T-B-NK+ SCID is radiation-sensitive SCID (RS-SCID), which includes Athabascan SCID (SCID-A), found in Athabascan-speaking Native Americans.
