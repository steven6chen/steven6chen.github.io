This includes traveling, working, exercising, and having sex. If you have any questions about doing an activity during pregnancy, be sure to ask your doctor or midwife.</p><p>Women with certain conditions might need to limit their activity. If your doctor or midwife thinks you should limit your activity, he or she will let you know.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258415797\"><span class=\"h1\">Travel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women can drive and travel by car throughout their pregnancy. But when traveling by car, it's important to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always wear your seat belt. The shoulder belt should go between your breasts and to the side of your belly. The lap belt should go under your belly.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take plenty of breaks during long trips. Be sure to stop often so that you can walk and stretch your legs. This helps prevent blood clots, which can be dangerous.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the car's air bags turned on.</p><p/><p>Women can also travel by plane during pregnancy. But if you are planning to fly toward the end of your pregnancy, check with the airline. Most airlines don't allow women to fly during their last month of pregnancy.</p><p>During long flights, be sure to shift your position while seated, and move your legs and feet often. You should also stand up and move around when it is safe to do so. This can prevent blood clots from forming in your legs.</p><p>If you are planning to travel to another country, let your doctor or midwife know. In some countries, infection is a concern. Ask your doctor or midwife whether you can safely go there. For example, many health care providers recommend that pregnant women not travel to places in the world where malaria or Zika virus is common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258415812\"><span class=\"h1\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors recommend that all adults, including pregnant women, get at least 30 minutes of exercise on all or most days of the week.</p><p>Exercise has many benefits during pregnancy. It can help with your mood, energy level, and sleep. It can also help with pregnancy symptoms such as constipation, bloating, swelling, and back pain.</p><p>The type of exercise that is right for you depends on your current pregnancy, past pregnancies, and how active you were before you got pregnant.</p><p>In general, doctors usually recommend walking and swimming as good types of exercise for pregnant women. Pregnant women should avoid activities in which they could easily fall or hurt their belly. These include hockey, soccer, basketball, horseback riding, downhill skiing, and gymnastics.</p><p>To exercise safely, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid lying flat on your back (after the first 3 months of pregnancy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start off slowly and slowly increase your level of activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid exercising in hot or humid weather</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink plenty of water</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a bra that supports your breasts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop exercising if you get out of breath and can't talk easily</p><p/><p>You should stop exercising and let your doctor or midwife know if you have any of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling light-headed or dizzy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A headache or chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contractions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid leaking from vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg swelling, pain, redness, or warmth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not feeling your baby move as much as usual</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258415827\"><span class=\"h1\">Work</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether or not you should stop working depends on your health, your baby's health, and what your work involves.</p><p>Women who have no problems during pregnancy can usually work up until they go into labor. But it depends on your job and what it involves.</p><p>Every employer has a Material Safety Data Sheet that contains information on the chemical properties and health effects of the substances used in the workplace. If you work with or near chemicals or other toxic substances, you should read this worksheet and discuss with your doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258415842\"><span class=\"h1\">Sex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women can keep having sex during a normal pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258415857\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=staying-healthy-when-you-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Staying healthy when you travel (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-tell-when-labor-starts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to tell when labor starts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preterm labor (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-travel-advice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: General travel advice (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preterm labor (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
