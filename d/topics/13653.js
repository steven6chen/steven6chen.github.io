Carrier systems include &quot;the reduced folate carrier,&quot; folate receptors, and the &quot;proton-coupled folate transporter.&quot; Absorption is optimal at slightly acidic pH (pH 5.5 to 6.0).</p><p>Folate must be reduced to be effective in its biological role in one-carbon transfer. It is reduced to dihydrofolate and then to tetrahydrofolate (THF) by a series of enzymatic steps. THF is subsequently converted to 5,10-methylene THF, which is converted to L-5-methyl-THF by the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase.</p><p>The predominant folate in plasma is L-5-methyl-THF. This is rapidly cleared by hepatocytes and other cells. Surgical biliary drainage results in a reduction in serum folate within six hours, whereas dietary restriction does not produce a comparable fall for three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This observation indicates that there is a large enterohepatic circulation of folate.</p><p>Folate enters cells by binding to a folate receptor. Megalin is a receptor related to the low-density lipoprotein receptor that can take up various proteins, including folates bound to the soluble folate receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The principal role of folate in DNA synthesis is to supply methyl groups that are added to other molecules (ie, to act as a one-carbon donor). The principal role of vitamin B12 is to act as a cofactor in the reaction that recycles 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate back to tetrahydrofolate (THF), which can then be converted to forms that can act as one-carbon donors. Generation of THF is coupled to the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. THF is then converted to the carbon-donating forms of folate, 10-formyl-THF and methylene-THF (also called 5,10-CH<sub>2</sub>-THF or 5,10-methyleneTHF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/6,11,18,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,18,20-23</a>].

Additionally, lack of vitamin B12 may result in deficiency of methionine, which is used to make S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), also used as a one-carbon donor (the formate starvation hypothesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-pathophysiology-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>One carbon metabolism is used in several reactions needed to make the building blocks of DNA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79271 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Purines</strong> &ndash; 10-formylTHF donates two methyl groups for purine synthesis (incorporated into the purine ring).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pyrimidines</strong> &ndash; 5,10-methyleneTHF donates a methyl group to convert deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).
