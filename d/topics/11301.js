Neuromuscular block should be monitored for all patients who receive NMBAs during anesthesia, to guide dosing of NMBAs and reversal agents, and to assess the degree of recovery.</p><p>This topic will discuss the devices that may be used, the patterns of nerve stimulation, and interpretation of results. The choice of NMBAs, clinical uses for anesthesia, and reversal of neuromuscular block are discussed separately.

If a quantitative, objective monitor is not available, a peripheral nerve stimulator may be utilized, but only to determine the depth of block (train-of-four [TOF] count). Evaluations of TOF fade made subjectively (with a peripheral nerve stimulator) <strong>cannot</strong> assure adequate recovery. (See <a href=\"#H2851283117\" class=\"local\">'Subjective evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>We agree with the guidelines issued by the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) statements that a peripheral nerve stimulator is mandatory when NMBAs are used, and that a quantitative peripheral nerve stimulator is required to adequately assess the train-of-four ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The momentum for establishing guidelines for monitoring neuromuscular function is increasing, as postoperative residual weakness continues to be a patient safety concern.

In a 2017 survey of anesthesia clinicians in Denmark, objective neuromuscular monitors were always used by 60 percent of clinicians when NMBAs were administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H221727416\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical tests that have historically been used to assess recovery from neuromuscular blockade (ie, grip strength, vital capacity, head lift) <strong>are not sensitive or specific for detection of residual weakness </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. Reliance on clinical evaluation alone to manage neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) administration can result in residual paralysis.

The peripheral nerve stimulator consists of a battery powered device that may be portable or hand held, or mounted to the anesthesia workstation. Stimulator wires are connected to surface electrodes placed on the skin along the course of a peripheral nerve, optimally positioned to avoid direct stimulation of the muscle being monitored. The negative electrode is placed distally and the positive electrode proximally to ensure most effective neurostimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3515857479\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerves that may be monitored</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several sites are commonly used for neuromuscular monitoring during administration of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). Response to stimulation varies among different muscles at the same level of neuromuscular block. (See <a href=\"#H2354442800\" class=\"local\">'Differential muscle sensitivity'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4031965297\"><span class=\"h3\">Ulnar nerve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ulnar nerve is the preferred site for peripheral nerve stimulation, since it is generally readily accessible and the results are not confounded by direct muscle stimulation: a single ulnar nerve branch crosses over to the radial side of the hand and innervates the adductor pollicis (AP) muscle. The response is assessed at the AP muscle by monitoring adduction of the thumb. Maximal neuronal stimulation and muscular response are achieved by placing the negative electrode one centimeter proximal to the wrist crease, with the positive electrode four to five centimeters proximally along the ulnar surface of the volar forearm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114145 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The abductor digiti minimi (ADM) can also be monitored when stimulating the ulnar nerve, but such monitoring is generally reserved for electromyographic (EMG) monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H1317617538\" class=\"local\">'Electromyography'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4161247922\"><span class=\"h3\">Facial nerve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Facial nerve stimulation is less accurate than ulnar nerve stimulation, but may be necessary if surgical positioning limits access to the hands or feet (eg, with the patient&rsquo;s arms tucked at the sides under surgical drapes during laparoscopic pelvic surgery). In one prospective cohort study, 150 patients who received NMBAs during anesthesia were assessed for residual paralysis using acceleromyography in the post anesthesia care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Fifty-two percent of patients who were subjectively monitored with facial nerve stimulation had residual paralysis (ie, train-of-four [TOF] ratio &lt;90 percent), compared with 22 percent of patients who had subjective ulnar nerve monitoring. If facial nerve monitoring is used during surgery, ulnar nerve stimulation should be used to confirm adequate reversal of neuromuscular block before extubation, preferably by objective means. (See <a href=\"#H2354442800\" class=\"local\">'Differential muscle sensitivity'</a> below.) </p><p>Facial nerve electrodes are placed on the mastoid process and just anterior to the tragus of the ear, to minimize the risk of direct muscle stimulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114147\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114147 \">figure 2</a>). Both electrodes can also be placed anterior to the ear, along the course of the facial nerve. Contraction of the orbicularis oculi or the corrugator supercilii muscle is subjectively assessed by palpation (or visually) at the eyebrow in response to stimulation. Acceleromyographic (objective) monitoring is possible (and recommended) at both corrugator supercilii and orbicularis oculi muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H900640819\" class=\"local\">'Acceleromyography'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H810672869\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior tibial nerve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The posterior tibial nerve can be stimulated by placing electrodes superior to the medial malleolus and monitoring the response (flexion) of the great toe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114146\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114146 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H959224102\"><span class=\"h3\">Paralyzed limb</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuromuscular monitoring should not be performed on a paralyzed limb. Upregulation of acetylcholine receptors after denervation results in resistance to nondepolarizing NMBAs, and variable exaggeration of the train-of-four ratio in paretic limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Thus, the degree of systemic neuromuscular block may be underestimated if a paretic limb is monitored. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3635433478\"><span class=\"h2\">Patterns of stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of patterns of neurostimulation may be used to monitor the degree of neuromuscular blockade. The most commonly used stimulation patterns are the TOF, tetanus, and post-tetanic count. </p><p>Responses to patterns of stimulation differ between depolarizing and nondepolarizing block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2854521310\"><span class=\"h3\">Single twitch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Single-twitch (ST) stimulation involves one supramaximal neurostimulation every 10 seconds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114136\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114136 \">figure 4</a>). ST stimulation is used to determine the potency of NMBAs and is not used clinically. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1932544448\"><span class=\"h3\">Train-of-four</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TOF stimulation consists of four successive supramaximal stimuli delivered at 2 Hz, no less than 10 seconds apart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114137\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114137 \">figure 5</a>). After administration of a nondepolarizing NMBA, responses at this frequency show fade, or progressively decreasing amplitude of the responses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114138\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114138 \">figure 6</a>). A TOF ratio (TOFR) is calculated by dividing the amplitude of the fourth response by the amplitude of the first response, and requires an objective measure of the response to stimulation. </p><p>With progressive nondepolarizing block, the fourth twitch disappears, followed by the third, then the second, and finally the first (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114139\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114139 \">figure 7</a>). As neuromuscular block dissipates, the train-of-four twitches reappear one by one, with the degree of fade decreasing as full neuromuscular function returns. The TOF count (TOFC) is defined as the number of detectable evoked responses, and it correlates with the degree of neuromuscular block, as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TOFC = 1 : &gt;95 percent of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) blocked</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TOFC = 2 : 85 to 90 percent of nAChRs blocked</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TOFC = 3 : 80 to 85 percent of nAChRs blocked</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TOFC = 4 : 70 to 75 percent of nAChRs blocked</p><p/><p>With depolarizing block, fade does not occur, and all four twitches decline in amplitude to a similar extent, unless phase 2 block occurs. Fade in response to TOF stimulation or tetanus, and post-tetanic potentiation, are signs of development of depolarizing phase II block. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2773658889\"><span class=\"h3\">Tetanus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tetanic stimulation, also called tetanus, involves repetitive stimulation at a frequency of &gt;30 Hz for 5 seconds, which causes sustained muscle contraction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114140\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114140 \">figure 8</a>). Tetanic contraction fades as the level of nondepolarizing NMBA-induced blockade increases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114141\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114141 \">figure 9</a>), and the degree of fade is equivalent to the fade with TOF stimulation. </p><p>Tetanus should be performed at a frequency below approximately 60 Hz, which is the frequency at which voluntary muscle contraction occurs. At a supraphysiologic frequency, tetanic fade may occur even in the absence of NMBA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H930783198\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-tetanic potentiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Post-tetanic count (PTC) consists of a five-second tetanic (50 Hz) stimulus, followed by a series of ST stimuli delivered at 1 Hz for 20 seconds. Tetanus transiently mobilizes presynaptic acetylcholine (Ach) release into the neuromuscular junction, and therefore the response to subsequent stimulation is potentiated. &#160;</p><p>This pattern is useful during deep levels of nondepolarizing neuromuscular block with a TOFC of zero. If PTC is 1, spontaneous recovery from intermediate-acting NMBAs to a TOFC of 1 can take up to 30 minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114142\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114142 \">figure 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The TOF count and ratio, and apparent recovery from neuromuscular block, are increased for a variable period of time after tetanus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Thus, train-of-four monitoring at the same site after tetanic stimulation may lead to either unnecessary intraoperative administration of additional NMBA, or overestimation of the degree of recovery at the end of surgery. As such, we suggest waiting two to three minutes after tetanic stimulation before resuming train-of-four monitoring. Assessing the response to tetanic stimulation during moderate levels of block (when TOF count is 1 to 3) yields no useful information and should not be used. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1178083623\"><span class=\"h3\">Double burst stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Double-burst stimulation was developed because the assessment of two, instead of four, stimuli might allow more accurate subjective assessment of fade. The two mini-tetanic bursts are delivered 0.75 seconds apart. As in TOFR, the ratio is determined by comparing the second muscle response to the first (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114144\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114144 \">figure 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114143\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114143 \">figure 12</a>). In awake patients, it is less painful than tetanic stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] but it is more painful than TOF. When objective monitoring is used, it offers no advantage over the more widely used TOF pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2851283117\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBJECTIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subjective monitoring refers to visual or tactile (eg, holding the patient&rsquo;s thumb and feeling movement) evaluation of the train-of-four count (TOFC) or degree of train-of-four (TOF) fade in response to neurostimulation provided by a peripheral nerve stimulator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114145 \">figure 1</a>). Assessment of the degree of neuromuscular block using subjective evaluation is less accurate than objective evaluation, both when assessing the TOFC and TOF fade. Thus, subjective evaluation with a peripheral nerve stimulator may provide inaccurate information for the timing and dose of reversal agents (TOFC) and assessment of full recovery (TOF fade). If a quantitative, objective monitor is not available, subjective monitoring with a peripheral nerve stimulator should be used, recognizing the limitations of subjective assessment. Suggested management according to monitoring, and a comparison of the depth of block based on objective and subjective monitoring, are included in tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114083\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114083 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114082\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114082 \">table 2</a>). &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assessing train-of-four count &mdash; </strong>Clinicians tend to overestimate the TOFC when using subjective evaluation, especially at moderate levels of block. In one study including 90 patients who were recovering from an intubating dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vecuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vecuronium</a>, the TOFC was assessed subjectively by clinicians and simultaneously with acceleromyography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The train-of-four count was the same in 36 percent of measurements at a TOFC of one to three, and 87 percent at TOFC of zero or four; 96 percent of disagreements were overestimates using subjective assessment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assessing fade &mdash; </strong>Similarly, the level of fade is difficult to detect subjectively, with most clinicians unable to detect fade when TOF ratios &gt;0.4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. Multiple studies have reported residual neuromuscular block (ie, TOFR &lt;0.9 measured by quantitative monitors) despite the use of subjective monitoring with a peripheral nerve stimulator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-neuromuscular-blocking-agents-in-anesthesia#H1726332908\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Avoidance of residual neuromuscular blockade'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3417565282\"><span class=\"h1\">OBJECTIVE MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several modes of monitoring are available in which the mechanical or electrical response to stimulation is measured objectively. The most commonly used mode is acceleromyography (AMG).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H900640819\"><span class=\"h2\">Acceleromyography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For AMG using the adductor pollicis muscle (APM), an accelerometer mounted to the thumb measures acceleration in response to ulnar nerve stimulation. AMG is the most commonly used quantitative neuromuscular blockade monitor. This technique is based on the Newton's Second Law of Motion (ie, force = mass x acceleration), such that the force exerted by the thumb is proportional to measured acceleration, since mass doesn&rsquo;t change. The monitor displays a train-of-four count, and when there are four twitches, a train-of-four ratio. For AMG the arm position must stay the same throughout the monitoring period, and the thumb must be free to move, unimpeded by surgical drapes or positioning. Therefore, AMG cannot be applied to an arm that is tucked at the patient&rsquo;s side, unless the arm is placed in a special protective device. Following induction of general anesthesia, the AMG device should be calibrated prior to administration of NMBA. &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1317617538\"><span class=\"h2\">Electromyography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electromyography (EMG) utilizes stimulating skin electrodes to generate an action potential of the target peripheral nerve, and the evoked muscle response (action potential) is measured. EMG electrodes are typically placed over the ulnar nerve and the adductor pollicis, abductor digiti minimi, or first dorsal interosseus muscle response is measured. EMG is most commonly used as part of multimodal intraoperative neuromonitoring, and is generally outside the realm of the anesthesiologist, although several handheld monitors do exist. When recorded simultaneously, train-of-four (TOF) ratios are higher with AMG monitoring than with EMG monitoring; however, recovery is still defined by a train-of-four ratio (TOFR) &gt;0.9 as measured at the adductor pollicis with either modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1753538510\"><span class=\"h2\">Kinemyography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kinemyography (KMG) measures the electrical signal generated from the distortion (bending) of a mechanosensor that is placed at the base of the thumb and index finger. KMG results are not interchangeable with other quantitative modalities, and the technology has similar limitations as AMG, being dependent on freely moving muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, KMG is an easy to use modality and is a much more reliable monitor than subjective assessment with a peripheral nerve stimulator. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2354442800\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL MUSCLE SENSITIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle groups respond differently to neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs), such that the monitored twitch response may not accurately reflect neuromuscular transmission in clinically important muscles (eg, airway muscles and diaphragm). After NMBA administration, neuromuscular block occurs faster in central muscles (eg, larynx and diaphragm) than peripheral muscles, because of greater blood flow and drug delivery. However, the diaphragm is also more resistant to the effects of nondepolarizing NMBAs, and recovers faster, because it has a higher density of nAChRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The response to stimulation at the corrugator supercilii muscle (at the eyebrow) correlates closely with neuromuscular block at the diaphragm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114082\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114082 \">table 2</a>). &#160;</p><p>The clinical implications of the difference in sensitivity of various muscles include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During intubation if deep neuromuscular blockade is confirmed by monitoring adductor pollicis stimulation, pharyngeal muscles are usually blocked as well, and optimal intubating conditions are achieved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During surgery, the absence of a twitch at the adductor pollicis muscle (APM) does not guarantee that the diaphragm will be paralyzed. A post-tetanic count of 1 or 2 at the APM indicates deep block, but diaphragm movement is still possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During recovery from neuromuscular block, a train-of-four ratio &gt;0.9 at the APM represents full recovery; the airway muscles and diaphragm have recovered fully. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring facial muscles will overestimate the degree of recovery.

If a quantitative monitor is not available, a peripheral nerve stimulator may be used with subjective evaluation, recognizing the limitations of the technology. Clinical tests (ie, grip strength, vital capacity, head lift) are not sensitive or specific for detection of residual weakness. (See <a href=\"#H39711368\" class=\"local\">'When and how to monitor neuromuscular blockade'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2851283117\" class=\"local\">'Subjective evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H221727416\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuromuscular monitoring for NMBAs most commonly involves the use of a peripheral nerve stimulator, with stimulation of a nerve and assessment of the muscle response.

With progressive nondepolarizing block, the amplitude of successive twitches in the TOF decrease, or fade, and ultimately the twitches disappear one by one. The TOF ratio (TOFR) (ie, ratio of the amplitude of the fourth to the first twitch) and the TOF count (TOFC) (ie, the number of twitches that occur after TOF stimulation) are used as measures of the degree of nondepolarizing neuromuscular block. With depolarizing block, fade does not occur during TOF stimulation, unless phase II block develops. (See <a href=\"#H1932544448\" class=\"local\">'Train-of-four'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tetanic stimulation, also called tetanus, involves repetitive stimulation at a frequency of &gt;30 Hz for 5 seconds, which causes sustained muscle contraction. With increasing nondepolarizing block, tetanic contraction fades. (See <a href=\"#H2773658889\" class=\"local\">'Tetanus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Post-tetanic count (PTC) consists of a five-second tetanic (50 Hz) stimulus, followed by a series of single stimuli delivered at 1 Hz for 20 seconds. Post-tetanic potentiation, or increase in PTC, is a characteristic of nondepolarizing neuromuscular block, and is useful during deep levels of block with a TOFC of zero.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The TOFC and TOFR are increased, or potentiated, for a variable period of time after tetanus. Therefore, tetanus should not be used during moderate levels of neuromuscular block (ie, TOFC 1 to 3), and TOF stimulation should not be used for two to three minutes after tetanus, to avoid underestimating the degree of neuromuscular block. (See <a href=\"#H930783198\" class=\"local\">'Post-tetanic potentiation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most commonly used mode of objective intraoperative neuromuscular monitoring is accelerometry. An accelerometer is attached to the thumb to measure acceleration in response to TOF stimulation of the ulnar nerve. The TOFC is displayed, and if four twitches are present, a TOFR is displayed as well. (See <a href=\"#H900640819\" class=\"local\">'Acceleromyography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differential muscle sensitivity must be recognized when interpreting the results of neuromuscular monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H2354442800\" class=\"local\">'Differential muscle sensitivity'</a> above.) </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-neuromuscular-blockade/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Checketts MR, Alladi R, Ferguson K, et al.
