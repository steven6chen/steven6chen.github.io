When fully expressed, the manifestations include irregular menstrual cycles, hirsutism, obesity, and a constellation of cardiometabolic disturbances. It is a common endocrinopathy, occurring in 5 to 7 percent of reproductive age women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> in the management of PCOS will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and other treatment options for PCOS are reviewed separately.

Metformin is typically the first-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes; it is not approved for use in prediabetes or PCOS, although it is often prescribed for treatment of these conditions.</p><p>Early trials in women with PCOS subsequently demonstrated a small benefit for weight reduction, a decrease in serum androgens (without improvement in hirsutism), and restoration of menstrual cycles in approximately 50 percent of women with oligomenorrhea (although not always ovulatory). Early data also suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> was effective for ovulation induction in anovulatory women with PCOS. As a result, metformin was used &quot;off-label&quot; for a number of these indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Although there was widespread enthusiasm for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> therapy in women with PCOS for a number of years, clinical data do not support the use of metformin for treatment of hirsutism or as first-line treatment for ovulation induction in this population. However, whether metformin has a beneficial long-term effect upon reducing the risk of conversion to diabetes from prediabetes has not been addressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H599677501\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a>'s major effect is to decrease hepatic glucose production, thus reducing the need for insulin secretion; it also decreases intestinal absorption of glucose. Metformin also has an antilipolytic effect that lowers free fatty acid concentrations, thus reducing gluconeogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> is a biguanide antihyperglycemic approved for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus when hyperglycemia cannot be managed by diet and exercise alone. Unlike sulfonylureas, it does not produce hypoglycemia in either normal subjects or patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin is also suggested for diabetes prevention in patients age &lt;60 years <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> body mass index (BMI) &ge;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or glycated hemoglobin (A1C) of 5.7 to 6.4 percent, in whom lifestyle interventions failed to improve glycemic indices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-in-the-treatment-of-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metformin in the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Metformin'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine with peak plasma levels occurring two hours after ingestion. Food decreases the rate of drug absorption and peak drug concentration. Metformin is not metabolized and is largely excreted in the urine. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than renal clearance of creatinine, which indicates that tubular secretion is the main route of excretion. The plasma elimination half-life is approximately six hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> is available in a generic form as 500, 850, and 1000 mg tablets. The target dose is 1500 to 2000 mg daily; clinically significant responses are not regularly observed at doses less than 1000 mg daily. Many clinicians begin treatment with 500 mg taken with a meal to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. If tolerated, the dose can be increased to 500 mg at both lunch and dinner and then to 500 mg at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. One to two weeks should elapse between increases in dose.</p><p>Extended-release tablets are also available, although patients who are doing well on short-acting preparations should continue them as there is little, if any, additional benefit documented with the long-acting preparation. However, extended-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> may be associated with fewer side effects, and in general, we suggest starting with these formulations rather than the short-acting ones. With extended-release tablets, the entire daily dose may be given at dinner time. The dose is initially 500 mg with dinner and is escalated gradually to a maximum of 2000 mg.</p><p>Finally, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> exists in both a liquid formulation and a specially formulated tablet designed to release the medication more slowly into the intestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In instances where the traditional formulations are not tolerated, it is occasionally helpful to have the patient try either the liquid or slow-release formulation before abandoning metformin therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H199669185\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects and precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effects are gastrointestinal: diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, flatulence, indigestion, and abdominal discomfort. These symptoms are usually mild, transient, and reversible after dose reduction or discontinuation of the drug.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> also reduces intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 in up to 30 percent of patients and lowers serum vitamin B12 concentrations in 5 to 10 percent but only rarely causes megaloblastic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In women with PCOS taking metformin, we suggest yearly monitoring for B12 deficiency with a complete blood count (CBC) and serum B12 concentration. In addition, women should make sure they meet the recommended dietary allowances for B12 (2.6 mcg for adults). This can be done either with food or supplements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-in-the-treatment-of-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H2189935888\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metformin in the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Vitamin B12 deficiency'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lactic acidosis has been described, but it is an extremely rare complication in otherwise healthy individuals. However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> should not be prescribed for women with other conditions that increase the risk of lactic acidosis, such as renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, or sepsis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-in-the-treatment-of-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metformin in the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Lactic acidosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H199669091\"><span class=\"h3\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although data are limited, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> use by breastfeeding women with PCOS does not appear to be associated with adverse outcomes. Concentrations of metformin in breast milk appear to be low, and the mean infant exposure to metformin has been reported to be well below the level of concern for breastfeeding; no adverse effects on blood glucose of nursing infants have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL USES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is the only approved indication for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>. Nevertheless, it has been used &quot;off-label&quot; to treat or prevent several clinical problems associated with PCOS, including oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, anovulatory infertility, prevention of pregnancy complications, and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, it is not a first-line drug for either oligomenorrhea or weight loss, and it is ineffective for the other indications. (See <a href=\"#H599678026\" class=\"local\">'No longer indicated'</a> below.)</p><p>Although it might be preferable to treat only insulin-resistant women with PCOS, there is currently no readily available, reliable test to evaluate the presence of insulin resistance. Some clinicians do not test at all; others perform an oral glucose tolerance test to look for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and check for elevated insulin levels. We do not suggest measuring insulin levels, as the results do not affect management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulin resistance: Definition and clinical spectrum&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H176328674\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Cardiometabolic risk assessment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H328336713\"><span class=\"h2\">Reproductive</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Oligomenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with oligomenorrhea due to PCOS who need endometrial protection (and contraception or management of hirsutism), we suggest oral contraceptives (OCs; combined estrogen-progestin) as first-line therapy.

Evidence for the efficacy of metformin includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, 23 women with PCOS were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> (500 mg three times per day) or placebo for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Approximately one-half of the women treated with metformin achieved normalization of menstrual function, confirmed by intermenstrual interval and luteal phase serum progesterone monitoring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 13 trials, women treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> had a fourfold higher chance of ovulating than women treated with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A similar fourfold increase was seen for the combination of metformin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> when compared with clomiphene alone. The use of metformin for ovulation induction is reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Anovulatory infertility'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endometrial protection </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Some women do not ovulate during the first six months of treatment, and therefore, we recommend cyclic progestin treatment during this interval. Although some women may have restoration of menses with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, unless cycles are regular and ovulatory, one cannot assume that the patient has reliable endometrial protection. For those who have menses that are irregular and anovulatory, cyclic progestins or OCs are necessary. We typically use either micronized progesterone (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for 14 days every one to two months) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for 12 to 14 days every one to two months).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who do not attain regular ovulatory menses should be treated with cyclic progestin therapy to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia until regular menses are established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After initiating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> therapy, it may take up to six months for ovulatory cycles to ensue. During the initial phase of oligomenorrhea, it may be difficult to determine if ovulation has taken place. Measuring serum progesterone every 10 days may be one approach, although cumbersome, to identify if ovulation has occurred following initiation of metformin therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We do not typically use this approach. If menstrual cycles are regular, we do not check serum progesterone levels. If cycles are irregular, we add cyclic progestin therapy as outlined above. If the patient then develops regular menses between courses of cyclic progestin therapy, the progestin can be stopped to see if spontaneous ovulations have developed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A contraceptive (eg, diaphragm, condom) should be prescribed for all sexually active women not planning pregnancy since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> treatment may induce ovulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>OCs versus </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> &ndash; There have been concerns that estrogen-progestin contraceptives may worsen insulin resistance in women with PCOS and that metformin should therefore be the preferred treatment. However, while OCs are less beneficial than metformin for insulin sensitivity, they are more effective for androgen suppression and menstrual cycle control. In addition, available data have not shown any evidence of adverse metabolic risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a meta-analysis of four trials that included 104 women with PCOS, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> was less effective than OCs for improving menstrual pattern and in reducing serum total testosterone concentration but more effective for reducing fasting insulin and not increasing fasting triglyceride concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The two best studied metformin regimens are 500 mg three times daily (1500 mg daily) and 850 mg twice daily (1700 mg daily).

However, metformin administration before or during IVF cycles does appear to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Similar estimates of benefits were reported in two meta-analyses (odds ratio [OR] 0.27 for risk of OHSS with metformin compared with placebo use). Although metformin therapy is a potential option to lower the risk of OHSS with IVF, there appear to be more effective strategies, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].
