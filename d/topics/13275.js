Pelvic floor dysfunction is a global term used to describe conditions such as pelvic organ prolapse, fecal or urinary incontinence, and chronic pelvic pain. Myofascial pain syndrome is a potential etiology of chronic pelvic pain that can be associated with urinary and bowel symptoms.</p><p>For women with pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence issues, the therapist develops a treatment program that addresses the weakness of the pelvic floor and related structures, including but not limited to the abdominal wall and hip girdle musculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This program may include pelvic floor muscle training, biofeedback, and electrical stimulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urinary incontinence in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fecal incontinence in adults: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many experts believe that many, if not most, women with chronic pelvic pain have some degree of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome, a disorder in which pelvic pain is attributed to short, tight, tender pelvic floor muscles, usually with myofascial trigger points. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Management of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome may also utilize pelvic floor muscle training, biofeedback, and electrical stimulation. However, additional forms of pelvic floor physical therapy may be employed secondary to the unique pathophysiology of this syndrome, which involves changes in the length tension relationship of the muscle, as well as changes in neural function. These may also be related to a visceral pathology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>This topic provides an overview of the conceptual framework from which pelvic floor physical therapists approach the myofascial component of pelvic pain syndromes. It is intended to inform clinicians who refer patients for this intervention. An overview of multimodal treatment approaches to this disorder is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF MYOFASCIAL PELVIC PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myofascial pelvic pain is most often associated with the presence of myofascial trigger points within local muscles of the pelvis or distant muscles that refer to the pelvis. The causal mechanism is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL TO PHYSICAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians can contact the American Physical Therapy Association for a listing of physical therapists in their area that specialize in the management of pelvic floor dysfunction. The clinician and physical therapist should have a good working relationship so that the physical therapist can communicate with the clinician when medical support is required to facilitate treatment, such as with injections or needling procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three major areas included in the evaluation by the physical therapist are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal system &ndash; The musculoskeletal evaluation includes assessment of posture, gait, range of motion of the spine and extremities, length and strength relationship of relevant muscles, and documentation of pain distribution. Specific muscles would be assessed for myofascial trigger points.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic floor muscles &ndash; The pelvic floor musculature is evaluated by inserting one or two fingers into the vagina or rectum and palpating the pelvic muscles. An instrumental evaluation of the pelvic floor (eg, surface electromyography - discussed below) may be performed to obtain additional information about strength and <span class=\"nowrap\">tension/stiffness</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft tissue &ndash; The soft tissue evaluation involves manually assessing areas of connective tissue for trophic changes and restrictions, muscles and other tissues for myofascial trigger points and neural tissue for irritability and mobility.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain mapping diagrams</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Working with the patient to create a pain map is a useful tool for locating trigger points (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Trigger points'</a> below). The patient is asked to draw the locations of her pain on a body diagram. In addition, the character of the pain and other symptoms should be noted using colors or symbols (eg, red or B for burning pain, blue or I for itching, green or A for aching) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80741\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80741 \">figure 1</a>). Severity of pain is noted using a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (excruciating pain). The clinician can use the same type of diagram to document <span class=\"nowrap\">her/his</span> objective findings of trophic changes, connective tissue restrictions, tenderness, scar tissue and trigger points. This form becomes a permanent part of the medical record and serves as a valuable tool for documenting changes and evaluating progress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Posture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poor posture can lead to excessive strain on muscles and other soft tissues that can predispose the individual to injury and pain. Chronic poor posturing can lead to stretch weakness of muscles and supporting connective tissues, adaptive shortening of muscle and connective tissue structures, and the development of trigger points. Altered neural dynamics may develop as a result of stretch <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> compression of neural tissue in association with pain. Postural dysfunction or movement imbalance can also result from abnormal mechanical tensions (imbalances) in muscles and their related fascia, which can create trigger points and their associated pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In either case, the postural strain must be identified and resolved.</p><p>Postural assessment is dynamic, as well as static. From a side standing view, are the ear, shoulder, hip, knee, and ankle on the same vertical line? On frontal and back standing views, are the head and spine held straight and the arms equidistant from the waist? Are the shoulders, hips, and knees at the same height? Does the upper or lower back curve excessively? Do both kneecaps face straight ahead? Static posture evaluation might reveal common structural inadequacies such as leg length discrepancies or shortened muscle groups that maintain poor alignment of body structures. Excessive lumbar spine lordosis with an anterior pelvic tilt has been labeled the &quot;typical pelvic pain posture&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>For the dynamic assessment, the patient is observed walking, moving from sit to stand, and ascending and descending stairs. These activities are evaluated to observe dynamic postural adaptations that might be related to pain with movement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Range of motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of range of motion assessment is to determine whether there is any specific joint structure dysfunction. Evaluation includes both osteokinematic movements (eg, extension, flexion, adduction, abduction, or rotation of bones at joints) and arthrokinematic movements (ie, small gliding, rolling, or spinning movements occurring between joint surfaces).</p><p>In patients with myofascial pelvic pain, the trunk and lower extremity joints should be evaluated with special attention to the lumbopelvic complex, including the sacrococcygeal joint and hip joints. Muscle length is evaluated simultaneously with range of motion testing, which can be done both actively and passively. Adaptive muscle shortening is one source of decreased range of motion, but trigger points will also limit range of motion through inhibition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal and pelvic musculature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All muscles that directly relate to the pelvis (28 muscles have direct attachments to the pelvis) and those that refer to the pelvis should be evaluated, with special attention to the abdominal musculature because of its intimate relationship with pelvic floor function. Although coactivation of the abdominal and pelvic muscles is usually normal and advantageous, abnormally overactive or irritated abdominal wall musculature from trigger points such as surgical scars can provoke chronically active pelvic floor musculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The abdominal wall should also be evaluated for a diastasis of the rectus abdominus muscles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectus-abdominis-diastasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectus abdominis diastasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To assess the pelvic floor muscles, one or two of the examiner's fingers are inserted into the <span class=\"nowrap\">vagina/rectum</span> and brought laterally as they palpate the tissue from the posterior midline to the lateral pelvic side walls and then anteriorly. When the pelvic floor is short and tight, there may be difficulty in admitting the lubricated examining fingers into the vagina, even with full patient cooperation. After entering the <span class=\"nowrap\">vagina/rectum,</span> the examining finger is palpating for taut bands, scar tissue, and assessing the mobility of the <span class=\"nowrap\">vagina/rectum</span> on the underlying pelvic floor. Tight pelvic floor muscles form bulky, firm shelves of muscle, often with multiple taut bands that feel like &quot;violin strings&quot; which may have trigger points. Pressure onto these bands is usually painful, often with radiation of pain into the lower abdomen or hip, <span class=\"nowrap\">vagina/rectum,</span> bladder or urethra. This may elicit the patient&rsquo;s pain, especially when a trigger point is provoked. </p><p>Since muscle dysfunction can occur on either end of the length-tension curve of muscle function (the muscle is either too long or too short), it is important to determine where in the contraction-relaxation cycle a problem is occurring before initiating a treatment protocol. To do this, the manual pelvic floor examination is divided into two components: dynamic and passive.</p><p>The dynamic aspect is the digital palpation of the pelvic floor musculature during an active contraction. Is the patient able to isolate and actively perform a shortening contraction of the levator ani? If so, what is the strength, range of motion, and quality of the contraction? Differences between the two sides should also be noted. The strength can be described by using a manual muscle test scale such as the Brink scale, which is a four-point scale in three categories: contraction pressure, vertical displacement of the examiner's fingers, and duration of the squeeze [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The quality of the contraction can be described as smooth, jerky, or cog wheel recruitment of muscle fibers. The range of motion refers to the amount of movement noted during a shortening and lengthening contraction of the pelvic floor.</p><p>After the shortening contraction, the patient is asked to relax and whether or not she feels the post-shortening contraction muscle relaxation (&quot;can you feel your muscles letting go?&quot;). Assessing the lengthening contraction dynamically is done by asking the patient to drop or let her pelvic floor go, as if initiating urination. A Valsalva maneuver, straining, or pushing is not acceptable. Assessing post-lengthening contraction relaxation is done passively by digital palpation of the soft tissue structures during the return to the resting position. Again, the patient is questioned as to her awareness of the motion. A thorough soft tissue evaluation includes methodical palpation of the soft tissues, muscles for trigger points, neural irritability, and palpation of connective tissue for restrictions and scars. Palpation normally produces a sensation of pressure; pain upon digital palpation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> passive movement of the soft tissues is abnormal.</p><p>If available, a biofeedback instrument can be used to supplement this evaluation. Options include surface electromyography or measurement of pressure with transvaginal or transrectal probes. There are no standards for either of these forms of assessment, but the information gained helps to objectively monitor the patient's progress once treatment has been initiated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Soft tissue assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of a patient with myofascial pelvic pain syndrome includes a comprehensive palpatory soft tissue assessment of connective tissues of the abdominal wall, inguinal ligaments, suprapubic area, lower back, buttocks, vulva, and lower extremities. Changes in skin color, contour, temperature, elasticity, turgor, and bulk should be noted. A reddish brown discoloration of the skin can occur in the viscera-somatic areas of referral secondary to the trophic changes associated with the reflex vasoconstriction as well as with prolonged mechanical compression of the microvasculature. Bright red skin flares, known as dermographia, can occur with the palpation of the abnormal area.</p><p>Soft tissue palpation is performed with a light and a deep touch. Use of a small amount of massage cream facilitates this examination. The clinician uses a light touch to make a tactile assessment of the quality of the skin and its ability to move, as well as its texture, temperature, and turgor. The skin and soft tissue, including any scars, are also rolled between the examining fingers to assess the mobility between layers.</p><p>The deeper subcutaneous and muscular tissues are palpated to assess <span class=\"nowrap\">tension/stiffness,</span> irritability, consistency, viscoelastic properties, shear (ie, the assessment of movement between tissue layers), and fluid content. Any textural changes in the fascial layers should also be noted. The soft tissue layers should be fluid, moving freely with other subcutaneous tissues. Connective tissue restrictions (ie, thickening and resistance to pulling, stretching, shearing and skin rolling), also known as subcutaneous panniculosis, develop in the subcutaneous tissues of the referral zones associated with visceral pain and myofascial trigger points. Trophic changes (ie, changes resulting from interruption of nutrition) in the somatic area of referred pain of a visceral nature or trigger point occur as a result of reflex induced vasoconstriction. Descriptive words, such as compressible-rigid, rough-smooth, and circumscribed-diffuse, are used to document the changes noted in the tissues.</p><p>Examination of tissues with significant restrictions causes <span class=\"nowrap\">sharp/ripping/tearing</span> pain despite relatively mild manual pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Palpation of a small tender mass (like a wad of chewing gum) within the subcutaneous tissue may produce pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The location of scar tissue is documented and the scar is assessed for mobility and the production of pain, local or referred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Trigger points</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trigger points are areas of hyperirritability in muscular tissue that produce pain in referral zones when palpated. Muscles containing trigger points are usually short, weak, fatigue easily, and relax slowly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Trigger points can also be found in skin, scar tissue, fascia and ligaments throughout the pelvic floor.</p><p>Muscles directly related to, or that refer to, the pelvis are assessed for trigger points. The presence of trigger points within the muscles of the pelvic floor, hip girdle, and abdominal wall produces symptoms ranging from vague suprapubic or pelvic discomfort to severe pain. Trigger points within the adductor magnus can refer pain into the central pelvis while a trigger point in the levator ani may refer pain to the vagina. Trigger points in the urogenital diaphragm may refer to the bladder or urethra.</p><p>To locate a trigger point, the clinician palpates perpendicular to the fiber orientation of the muscle being assessed. When a taut band is felt, the palpating finger is turned to become parallel to the direction of the muscle fibers and used to find the most painful spot within the taut band. Ideally, when the clinician locates the trigger point, a local twitch response is produced in addition to reproduction of the patient's pain. Inter-rater reliability studies suggest that the minimal acceptable criteria for identification of an active trigger point is spot tenderness in a palpable band and patient recognition of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral nerves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specific nerves that should be evaluated are the pudendal and the posterior femoral cutaneous nerves. The connective tissues innervated by these nerves may be the most likely source of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the setting of minimal inflammation, pain tends to develop as a result of ischemia. Connective tissue changes resulting from ischemia can cause restrictive processes that may then lead to painful abnormal impulse generating sites. As an example, the cutaneous referral zone for the bladder is the entire saddle area of the lower trunk. When connective tissue changes are present because of the visceral reference to the skin, mechanical compression of the microvasculature by the elastic bands of undergarments at the thigh crease or excessive uninterrupted sitting can cause an ischemic compromise to branches of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and result in pain. This must be considered when patients have a diagnosis of a vulvar pain syndrome or when there is a complaint of pain in sitting in the saddle area or with complaints of &quot;sits bone pain&quot; (ischial tuberosities).</p><p>Clinical assessment is accomplished by manually assessing the mobility of the nerve in its anatomical distribution. The pudendal nerve is most easily palpated internally at the ischial spine as it enters Alcock's canal. Some discomfort is normal, but a lowered threshold of pain may indicate that there is some compromise to the nerve's mobility. This could be due to a nerve entrapment or may be related to ischemia of the connective tissue that surrounds it. Irritability of a nerve may also be assessed by distraction of the tissue with active contraction of the related musculature.</p><p>With the patient in a prone position, distraction of the posterior thigh crease (the normal anatomical path of the perineal branch of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve on its way to the perineal tissues) away from the body followed by asking the patient to actively simultaneously knee flex and hip extend will assess the ability of the nerve to move. The nervous system should have pain-free mobility 20 percent further than at its resting state.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">REHABILITATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive treatment program of muscle, joint and myofascial techniques should be individualized to address the specific dysfunctions noted during the patient evaluation. Important components of treatment are instruction in a home exercise program and self-management techniques. In addition, cognitive behavioral therapy is important to change the conditioned responses that may have developed as a result of the chronic pain state.</p><p>An individualized therapeutic exercise program is required to address any structural dysfunctions. Treatment sessions typically are one hour on a weekly basis. Re-evaluation is done after 10 treatments to determine if progress has been sufficient for physical therapy to continue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The total duration of treatment often depends on how long the patient has been symptomatic; some patients require a year or more of weekly therapy.</p><p>Initial treatment can be painful; the pace of treatment should be adjusted to the tolerance of the patient. Patients who are very symptomatic may have more frequent treatments, and patients who travel from far away for treatment can undergo daily treatments of two hours, for a week at a time, if tolerable. Trigger point injections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dry needling may be useful to facilitate the resolution of the trigger point.</p><p>Components of treatment include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myofascial manipulation including manual trigger point release, injections and dry needling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neural mobilization and stretching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rehabilitation of extrapelvic musculoskeletal abnormalities: neuromuscular reeducation and <span class=\"nowrap\">active/passive</span> stretching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Connective tissue manipulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scar tissue mobilization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Transvaginal/transrectal</span> manual therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic floor muscle reeducation</p><p/><p>Extrapelvic musculoskeletal abnormalities are addressed using standard physical therapy and orthopedic rehabilitation techniques.</p><p>During rehabilitation, it is important to avoid activities that are known to exacerbate the patient's condition, such as Kegel exercises, vaginal coitus, prolonged sitting and wearing underwear with elastic legs or tight jeans. If a significant diastasis recti is present (ie, more than 3 cm above the umbilicus and more than a few millimeters apart below the umbilicus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]), it should be corrected before progressive abdominal strengthening exercises are initiated in the treatment process. A compromised abdominal wall will not react reflexively as it should, thus limiting the ability of strengthening exercises to maximize pelvic floor muscle function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Closure is accomplished by having the patient perform isolated contractions of the rectus abdominis muscles while the muscles are supported in proper alignment by tightly wrapping a sheet around the midsection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myofascial manipulation, trigger point release techniques, connective tissue manipulation and neural mobilization and stretching of the extra-pelvic structures are done first in a prone position and then in supine. During a treatment session, the patient lies in a hook-lying position (supine with the hips and knees bent) as the physical therapist works internally to manually release the trigger points and the restricted movement of the connective tissues and muscles associated with the vagina, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the rectum. First, short muscle groups in the pelvis or elsewhere are lengthened using soft tissue techniques and passive and active exercises. After the muscles have lengthened, strengthening exercises can be initiated.</p><p>Manual joint mobilization techniques are utilized to treat arthrokinematic limitations of specific joints. Areas of structural hypomobility are mobilized while areas of hypermobility are stabilized through exercise and external supports. These interventions should facilitate normalization of osteokinematic movement of the joint.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Connective tissue manipulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Connective tissue restrictions associated with the <span class=\"nowrap\">viscero-somatic/somato-visceral</span> reflex and trigger points are treated with connective tissue manipulation. This is a superficial form of myofascial manipulation that utilizes pulling strokes on the skin and subcutaneous tissues to achieve reflex and local effects. This manipulation results in improved circulation to viscera, supporting tissues, muscles and nerves. All connective tissue from the nipple line to the lower leg, anterior and posterior, is treated.</p><p>Over the course of therapy, subcutaneous connective tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">restriction/panniculosis</span> becomes progressively softer and increasingly homogeneous to palpation. Dry needling in accordance with traditional Chinese acupuncture can be combined with these manual techniques to facilitate the release of connective tissue restrictions. In the words of the Chinese acupuncturist, this is achieved by releasing &ldquo;stagnant blood.&rdquo; Associated muscle trigger points often respond to the treatment of subcutaneous panniculosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Release of scars</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal and perineal scars with any connective tissue restriction require release. Manual methods for softening and release of scars includes strumming across and stroking along the scar, as well as rolling the scar between fingers and thumbs and adding distraction when possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Dry needling and local anesthetic injections are also used to facilitate scar tissue mobilization. The scar should be manually manipulated until it is fluid in its movement over underlying tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Transvaginal release of trigger points</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trigger points are treated with transvaginal manual release techniques or in combination with injections or dry needling. Dry needling by the physician or physical therapist is administered just prior to manual therapy performed by the physical therapist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Barrier release is the preferred method for manual trigger point pressure release. Initially, progressive pressure is applied into the trigger point until tissue resistance (barrier) is noted and the patient is uncomfortable; the pressure is maintained until the barrier releases. Pressure is increased again until a new tissue barrier is felt. This technique can be enhanced by combining it with other techniques, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">contract/relax,</span> postisometric relaxation, and reciprocal inhibition.</p><p>In the <span class=\"nowrap\">contract/relax</span> technique, the patient is asked to isotonically contract the levator against the resistance of the therapist's finger; elongation of the muscle is enhanced by the therapist as the patient relaxes the muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For postisometric relaxation, the levator ani is contracted isometrically against the resistance of the <span class=\"nowrap\">transvaginal/rectal</span> finger; this finger then assists with the lengthening process during complete voluntary relaxation. Reciprocal inhibition is the relaxation of an agonist muscle during contraction of the antagonistic muscle. As a pelvic floor trigger point is manipulated, the patient is asked to contract the abdominal wall (antagonist muscle) to initiate a submaximal Valsalva maneuver. Asking the patient to inhale while the pelvic floor trigger point is being manually treated is also a form of reciprocal inhibition that can facilitate its release.</p><p>Injection of an anesthetic solution into the trigger point or dry needling of the trigger point are both equally effective in accomplishing its immediate, but may be temporary, inactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;, section on 'Injections'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic exercise to put the muscle through its full available pain-free range is necessary after manual release, dry needling or injection treatment techniques. An individualized home exercise program is designed for each patient to utilize the changes made during therapy and to facilitate greater changes during the next therapy session. Stretching exercises are the mainstay of an exercise program for abdominal wall muscles with acute trigger points. After the trigger points are resolved, progressive abdominal strengthening is started. Exercises and interventions that may be recommended include reflex pelvic floor inhibition progressing to active pelvic floor lengthening and self myofascial and connective tissue manipulation. Once the pelvic floor is lengthened, a shortening contraction exercise program may be developed. Family members or significant others may be taught to do some of the myofascial and connective tissue manipulation techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given that the resolution of the patient's symptoms is the expected outcome of physical therapy, the clinician should expect positive changes within 10 visits. The therapist reevaluates the patient every 10 visits to assess progress and determine if therapy should continue. When the progress is not as expected, the physical therapist and clinician should collectively analyze the treatment approach.</p><p>The physical therapist's approach to the evaluation and treatment of chronic pelvic pain has not been evaluated rigorously. Retrospective observational studies on the management of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome with manual techniques report that 50 to 72 percent of patients describe moderate to marked improvement or complete resolution in symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Data from two randomized trials support manual myofascial physical therapy for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain with urologic symptoms. Both trials found that the positive responder rate was significantly higher with manual myofascial physical therapy compared to therapeutic massage (57 versus 21 percent in one trial) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The pilot study that included men and women had a 57 percent positive responder rate for the physical therapy treatment group, while the therapeutic massage treatment arm&rsquo;s positive responder rate was only 21 percent. Study subjects of the second larger trial were women who had a 59 percent positive responder rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a prospective cohort study of women with myofascial pelvic floor disorders, with urinary urgency and frequency-predominant symptoms, nearly 63 percent reported a positive response to treatment with pelvic floor physical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. More trials of the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to these patients are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who do not respond to pelvic floor physical therapy after 8 to 10 weeks should be reevaluated, possibly with additional testing or radiographic imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For example, patients with associated urologic symptoms and very little improvement after 10 treatments may be evaluated with cystoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging to rule out an urethral diverticulum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethral-diverticulum-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethral diverticulum in women&quot;</a>.) Patients with underlying skeletal abnormalities may benefit from osteopathic manipulation.</p><p>All patients must be educated about activities to avoid and stretches to do if any latent trigger points become active again or if a painful pelvic stimulus occurs (eg, urinary tract infection) in order to avoid relapsing into the muscle contraction pattern that originally caused the problem. For example, we ask all patients to avoid bearing down to assist bladder emptying.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
