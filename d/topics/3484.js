Smoking cigarettes is the most common cause of lung injury. As the lungs become more damaged over time, it becomes increasingly difficult to breathe. When the damage is severe, it may also become difficult to get enough oxygen into the blood and to get rid of excess carbon dioxide. These changes all lead to shortness of breath and other symptoms. Unfortunately, the symptoms of COPD cannot be completely eliminated with treatment and the condition usually worsens over time.</p><p>The term COPD includes both chronic bronchitis (inflammation of the bronchial tubes) and emphysema (destruction of the air sacs). The effects of chronic bronchitis and emphysema on breathing are similar, although there are some differences in symptoms, effects on the body, and treatment. </p><p>This article reviews the risk factors, symptoms, and tests used to diagnose COPD and its components, chronic bronchitis and emphysema. An article that discusses treatment of COPD is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatments (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COPD CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To understand why COPD develops, it is important to understand how the lungs work. Normally, air that we breathe passes from the nose and mouth through the airways to the tiny air sacs of the lung, called alveoli. In the air sacs, oxygen that we breathe passes through the walls of air sacs into the bloodstream (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67527\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67527 \">figure 1</a>). Carbon dioxide passes in the reverse direction, out of the bloodstream, back into the alveoli, and is then eliminated by breathing out (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73121\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73121 \">figure 2</a>). Carbon dioxide is a waste product of the body's metabolism, and must be regularly removed.</p><p>In people who develop COPD, irritating gases and particles are inhaled while smoking or breathing smoke filled air (secondhand smoke) or other fumes or particles, such as air pollution. These gases and particles can injure the airways and lungs and cause irritation (inflammation). Genetic susceptibility also likely plays a role, meaning that based on a person&rsquo;s individual genetic makeup, they may be more likely to suffer lung damage when exposed to lung irritants. Over time, the inflammation becomes chronic, damages the lung tissue, and may cause scarring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72806\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72806 \">figure 3</a>). This lung damage makes it more difficult to breathe in and out and makes it harder for oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass across the walls of the air sacs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Reasons for airflow blockage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any disease that interferes with airflow out of the lungs can cause COPD. Most people with COPD have chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and some also have asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic bronchitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic bronchitis is the term used to describe people who have a chronic cough that produces sputum, which is a result of bronchial inflammation. This condition is frequently seen in people who smoke cigarettes. Chronic bronchitis can scar the airways and reduce airflow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Emphysema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emphysema is the term used to describe damage to the air sacs in the lung. This damage can also restrict airflow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma is also a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. The triggers for this inflammation include exposure to inhaled allergens, respiratory irritants, and viral infections. The inflammation leads to relapsing and remitting episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. </p><p>Treatment is usually successful in reversing inflammation and airway narrowing. In a minority of people with asthma, the chronic inflammation permanently restricts airflow. When this airway narrowing cannot be completely reversed with treatment, the person is said to have COPD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">COPD RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking cigarettes significantly increases the risk of developing COPD. However, approximately 20 percent of people who develop COPD have never smoked.</p><p>Other factors that increase the risk of developing COPD include an abnormal sensitivity and exaggerated response to inhaled substances (called airway responsiveness), other exposures, such as secondhand exposure to smoke and workplace exposure to environmental dust or organic materials, or exposure to air pollution. COPD can run in families. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Risk factors and risk reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Genetic risk factors for COPD include severe deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin, a protein that protects the lungs. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">COPD SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>COPD usually causes no or mild symptoms at first. As the disease progresses, symptoms usually worsen. The most common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing and spitting up phlegm (mucus)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing (a whistling or squeaking noise as you breathe)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath at first with activity and, as disease worsens, at rest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">COPD DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have shortness of breath, a chronic cough, or cough up phlegm, your healthcare provider may recommend testing for COPD. The test used to diagnose COPD is a type of a pulmonary (lung) function test (PFT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pulmonary function test (PFT) that measures airway obstruction is called spirometry, and is required to diagnose COPD. Spirometry can detect COPD even in people who do not yet have symptoms.</p><p>During spirometry, you take a deep breath in and then blow out as hard and as fast as you can into a tube connected to a machine called a spirometer. The spirometer measures how fast and how much air you can blow out of your lungs. If the measurement is abnormal, the next step is to repeat the test after you use a bronchodilator that you breathe from an inhaler (which should improve the measurement). In people with asthma, the test measurements usually return to normal, but in people with COPD, the test measurements may only partially improve.</p><p>After the diagnosis of COPD is confirmed, spirometry is repeated over time to monitor the status of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment.</p><p>In some cases, additional pulmonary function tests are performed. These tests include measurements of lung volume, oxygenation, carbon dioxide, gas exchange, and exercise performance. The results of these tests are used to evaluate for lung diseases other than COPD that may be contributing to shortness of breath and to guide treatment of COPD in specific cases.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurements of lung volume are usually performed in a box that looks like an old fashioned phone booth. People with more severe COPD may have an increase in lung volume. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another machine can measure the ability of the lungs to transfer gases like oxygen. This machine usually uses a very small amount of carbon monoxide, which is not enough to cause harm, but which reflects how oxygen is absorbed. With emphysema, the ability to transfer gases is typically reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oximetry measures the amount of oxygen in the blood using a device called a finger oximeter, which clips onto the finger like a clip-on earring. Oximetry may also be checked during exercise, such as walking on level ground or climbing stairs. When the oxygen saturation drops to 88 percent or below, supplemental oxygen is usually prescribed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatments (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An arterial blood gas sample may be obtained to determine if you have problems clearing carbon dioxide from the blood. Arterial blood gas is usually obtained by taking a blood sample from the artery in your wrist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several types of exercise tests. The simplest is to determine how far you can walk in 6 minutes. In this test, your pulse, difficulty breathing, and blood oximetry are usually measured. A more extensive test can be performed on a bicycle or a treadmill that can measure your maximum ability to perform physical work and can monitor both heart and lung function. This test is often used to assess other causes for shortness of breath and before starting a rehabilitation program.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder which causes 2 to 3 percent of the cases of emphysema in the United States. All adults who have symptoms of COPD should be tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9577480\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT scan)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, a chest x-ray is not needed to make the diagnosis of COPD because COPD does not affect the chest x-ray unless the disease is very severe. Your doctor may perform a chest x-ray, however, to exclude other lung diseases. The CT scan is a very sensitive test to detect the presence of emphysema. In patients with severe disease, a CT scan to determine the presence of emphysema can help guide treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">COPD TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first and most important part of any treatment plan for COPD is for smokers to stop smoking. This is true regardless of how long ago you were diagnosed with COPD and how severe your disease is. Studies of people with COPD show that worsening of the disease is slowed in people who stop smoking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Currently, there is no cure for COPD; however, many treatments are available for the symptoms and complications of this disorder. Most patients require ongoing treatment to keep symptoms under control.</p><p>A separate topic discusses the treatment of COPD.
