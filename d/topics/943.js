The saccular outpouchings may herniate upon digital pressure. The primary histologic finding is the loss of elastic tissue in the dermis. </p><p>Anetoderma is divided into primary anetoderma and secondary anetoderma, with the former occurring in areas of previously normal skin and the latter developing in areas of prior skin pathology. Primary anetoderma may occur in association with underlying systemic conditions and warrants evaluation for associated disorders. There is no effective treatment for anetoderma. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of anetoderma will be reviewed here. Anetoderma is distinct from atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini, a disorder characterized by dermal atrophy and well-defined, hyperpigmented, depressed areas of skin. Atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini is reviewed separately.

There seems to be a female predominance in primary anetoderma.</p><p>The epidemiology of secondary anetoderma reflects that of the causative skin pathology. Other subtypes of anetoderma, including iatrogenic anetoderma of prematurity, congenital anetoderma, and familial anetoderma, present in infancy or childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

Historically, primary anetoderma was divided into presentations with preceding inflammation (Jadassohn-Pellizzari type), including erythema and urticaria, and presentations without preceding inflammation (Schweninger-Buzzi type) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. Given that these two subtypes are histologically identical and have a similar prognosis, this classification scheme has mostly been abandoned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191585991\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary anetoderma has occurred in patients with various systemic conditions and laboratory abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110595\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110595 \">table 1</a>). Some authors have classified such presentations as secondary anetoderma; however, we reserve the title of secondary anetoderma for anetoderma that develops in the site of preexisting skin disease.

Antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with anetoderma have occurred as an isolated finding or in association with other diseases. In a 2001 case report and review of 20 additional published cases of patients with both primary anetoderma and antiphospholipid antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies occurred as an isolated finding in four patients; the remaining patients also had primary antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), other autoimmune disorders, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A retrospective chart review of patients with SLE provides support for an association between antiphospholipid antibodies and anetoderma.

Fragmentation of the remaining elastic fibers may be seen, which can also be visualized on electron microscopy. </p><p>A perivascular inflammatory infiltrate composed of mostly lymphocytes, but also of histiocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils, can occur. Of note, the presence or absence of histologic inflammation is not related to clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/8,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,31</a>]. Elastophagocytosis, or phagocytosis of elastic fibers by macrophages, may be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Microthromboses have also been noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Direct immunofluorescence studies may demonstrate a granular or rarely linear band of immune reactants including immunoglobulins M (IgM) and G (IgG) as well as complement at the dermal-epidermal junction. A granular and fibrillar pattern of immune deposits can be seen between collagen fibers in the dermis. Fibrillar deposits of immune reactants, specifically C3, likely correlating with the location of elastic fibers, may be seen in the dermis. Immune reactants have also been noted around dermal blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. These direct immunofluorescence results are not specific to anetoderma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1880665011\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of anetoderma is not clearly understood. Available evidence suggests increased breakdown of elastic fibers may play a primary role. Potential mechanisms for this process include alterations in elastolytic enzyme activity, ischemia, phagocytosis of elastic fibers, and autoimmune and inflammatory processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upregulation or inhibition of elastolytic enzyme activity </strong>&ndash; Increased elastic fiber breakdown may result from an increase in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) elastolytic activity and a decrease in inhibition of this process. In support of this theory, increased production of proforms of gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) as well as increased activation of gelatinase A have been found in specimens of anetoderma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Increased production of MMP-2 in lesional skin without an accompanying increase in the production of tissue inhibitors of MMP-2 also has been detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ischemia </strong>&ndash; Ischemia may contribute to elastic fiber breakdown. The presence of microthromboses in biopsy specimens of anetoderma, both in patients with and without antiphospholipid antibodies, supports the theory that local ischemia may lead to activation of elastolytic enzymes and degradation of elastic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In iatrogenic anetoderma of prematurity, pressure may be a trigger for hypoxemia and may lead to the degeneration of elastic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Phagocytosis of elastic fibers </strong>&ndash; A role for phagocytosis of elastic fibers by macrophages has been suggested based upon the detection of this finding on electron microscopic examination of lesional tissue from a patient with clinical and histologic findings consistent with anetoderma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autoimmune and inflammatory processes </strong>&ndash; The association of anetoderma with antiphospholipid antibodies offers support to the theory that autoimmune and inflammatory processes contribute to anetoderma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. One theory is that anticardiolipin antibodies lead to endothelial damage or immune complex and complement activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/19,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,39</a>]. Other theories include the possible cross-reaction between beta-2-glycoprotein and antigens on elastic fibers; this is supported by the presence of immune reactants on elastic fibers on immunofluorescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of T lymphocytes in biopsy specimens of anetoderma lends support to an inflammatory component to this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p>In addition to elastic fiber breakdown, a decrease in the production of elastic fibers may contribute to anetoderma. The finding of reduced expression of fibulin-4, which aids in elastic fiber formation, in tissue specimens from anetoderma compared with specimens from healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] suggests that there may be an impairment in elastic fiber assembly. &#160; </p><p>Theories to explain the development of secondary anetoderma include the release of elastolytic enzymes from the primary inflammatory skin disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Anetoderma occurring in sites of skin tumors may result from the destruction of elastic fibers by mechanical trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1872804249\" class=\"local\">'Secondary anetoderma'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97301588\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of anetoderma usually can be made with physical examination alone. Examination of the skin demonstrates skin-colored or white, wrinkled and atrophic depressions or saccular outpouchings that may herniate on digital pressure. When the diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy can be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other elastic tissue disorders. The biopsy must include the mid-dermis. A 4 mm punch biopsy is adequate. (See <a href=\"#H13052284\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;, section on 'Punch biopsy'</a> and <a href=\"#H862794687\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p>Once a diagnosis of anetoderma is made, the clinician should determine the subtype of anetoderma. The major distinction is between primary and secondary anetoderma. The patient history aids in differentiation. Secondary anetoderma develops in sites of preexisting skin disease. Therefore, if there was no preceding skin disorder or only mild erythema or urticarial-type lesions were noted at the sites of anetoderma, then the anetoderma is best categorized as primary anetoderma. Attention to the age of onset, family history, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> use is useful for identifying patients with other subtypes, including iatrogenic anetoderma of prematurity, congenital anetoderma, familial anetoderma, and drug-induced anetoderma. Unlike primary anetoderma, which usually occurs in adults, iatrogenic anetoderma of prematurity, congenital anetoderma, and familial anetoderma first appear in infancy or childhood.

In another case report, combination therapy for anetoderma with a 595 nm pulsed-dye laser and a 1550 nm nonablative fractionated laser demonstrated flattening of skin lesions and improved texture after three sessions at three-week intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anetoderma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

The major subtypes of anetoderma are primary anetoderma and secondary anetoderma, with the former occurring in areas of previously normal skin and the latter developing in areas of prior skin pathology. Other subtypes include iatrogenic anetoderma of prematurity, congenital anetoderma, familial anetoderma, and drug-induced anetoderma. (See <a href=\"#H3115321496\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary anetoderma has been reported to occur in association with a variety of systemic conditions and laboratory abnormalities. The most consistently reported association is with antiphospholipid antibodies. (See <a href=\"#H1800340077\" class=\"local\">'Primary anetoderma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anetoderma is characterized by wrinkled and atrophic depressions or saccular outpouchings of the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F67581%7EDERM%2F110644%7EDERM%2F110646\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67581 graphicRef110644 graphicRef110646 \">picture 1A-C</a>). The saccular outpouchings may herniate upon digital pressure. (See <a href=\"#H13052284\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of anetoderma usually can be made based upon physical examination alone. If the diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. The primary pathologic finding is a loss or significant reduction of elastic fibers in the dermis. (See <a href=\"#H97301588\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H862794687\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the diagnosis of anetoderma is made, the clinician should determine the subtype of anetoderma. Patients with primary anetoderma require an evaluation for associated underlying disease. (See <a href=\"#H97301588\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1692730217\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on medical and procedural interventions for anetoderma are primarily limited to case reports and are insufficient to confirm efficacy of any therapy. In general, we do not treat anetoderma. For patients with secondary anetoderma, we treat the primary skin disorder to minimize risk for development of new lesions. There are case reports describing cosmetic improvement in anetoderma with laser therapy; however, data are insufficient to recommend routine use of laser treatment.
