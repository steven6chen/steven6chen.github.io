For many individuals, episodes of back pain are self-limited.

For example, the 2002 National Health Interview Survey found that 26 percent of respondents reported low back pain lasting at least one day in the last three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107855414\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors associated with back pain complaints include smoking, obesity, age, female gender, physically strenuous work, sedentary work, psychologically strenuous work, low educational attainment, Workers' Compensation insurance, job dissatisfaction, and psychologic factors such as somatization disorder, anxiety, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults/abstract/2,8,10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,10-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38923086\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are many etiologies of low back pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60679\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60679 \">table 2</a>), the majority of patients seen in primary care will have nonspecific low back pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H460846617\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonspecific back pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients seen in primary care (&gt;85 percent) will have nonspecific low back pain, meaning that the patient has back pain in the absence of a specific underlying condition that can be reliably identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Many of these patients may have musculoskeletal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Almost all patients with these conditions will have risk factors or other symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spinal cord or cauda equina compression</strong> &ndash; There are many causes of cauda equina syndrome, the most common being herniation of the intervertebral disc. One systematic review found that cauda equina syndrome was caused by herniation of the intervertebral disc in 22.7 percent of cases, ankylosing spondylitis in 15.9 percent, lumbar puncture in 15.9 percent, trauma in 7.6 percent, malignant tumor in 7.2 percent, benign tumor in 5.7 percent, and infection in 5.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. While the incidence of cord compression in patients known to have cancer varies depending on the cancer, among patients who are diagnosed with cord compression, it is the initial manifestation of malignancy in 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Metastatic disease from any primary cancer can cause cord compression.

Bowel <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bladder dysfunction are generally late findings. Early diagnosis and treatment improves outcomes.

A history of cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) is the strongest risk factor for back pain from bone metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among solid cancers, metastatic disease from breast, prostate, lung, thyroid, and kidney cancers account for 80 percent of skeletal metastases. Approximately 60 percent of patients with multiple myeloma have skeletal lytic lesions present at diagnosis.

In patients with a history of cancer, sudden, severe pain raises concern for pathologic fracture. Patients may also have neurologic symptoms from either spinal cord compression or spinal instability.

Initial symptoms (eg, fever and malaise) are often nonspecific; over time, localized back pain may be followed by radicular pain and, left untreated, neurologic deficits. Risk factors include recent spinal injection or epidural catheter placement, injection drug use, and other infections (eg, contiguous bony or soft tissue infection or bacteremia). Immunocompromised patients may also be at higher risk. Urgent antibiotic treatment and surgical therapy for those with neurologic symptoms is required for patients with spinal epidural abscess.

Men are more commonly affected than women. Many cases are thought to be health care-related or postprocedural from hematogenous spread of bacteremia. Less specific risk factors include an immunocompromised state and injection drug use.

While some produce no symptoms, other patients present with acute onset of localized back pain which may be incapacitating. There may be no history of preceding trauma. Risk factors for osteoporotic fracture include advanced age and chronic glucocorticoid use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 3</a>). A history of an osteoporotic fracture is a risk factor for subsequent fractures, which can be mitigated by pharmacologic therapy.

Damage to a spinal nerve root may result from degenerative changes in the vertebrae, disc protrusion, and other causes. The clinical presentations of lumbosacral radiculopathy vary according the level of nerve root or roots involved. Over 90 percent are L5 and S1 radiculopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Patients present with pain, sensory loss, weakness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reflex changes consistent with the nerve root involved; these are summarized in the table and discussed in more detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75645 \">table 4</a>). Testing for lumbar nerve root compression is shown in a figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68791\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68791 \">figure 1</a>). Many patients with symptoms of acute lumbosacral radiculopathy improve gradually with supportive care.

Usually, sciatica refers to a sharp or burning pain radiating down from the buttock along the course of the sciatic nerve (the posterior or lateral aspect of the leg, usually to the foot or ankle) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Most sciatica is attributable to radiculopathy at the L5 or S1 level from a disc disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spinal stenosis</strong> &ndash; Lumbar spinal stenosis is most often multifactorial. Spondylosis (degenerative arthritis affecting the spine) spondylolistheses, and thickening of the ligamentum flavum are the most common causes, typically affecting patients &gt;60 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74811 \">figure 2</a>).

Other symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis can include back pain and sensory loss and weakness in the legs, though many patients may present with a normal neurologic exam. Symptoms of neurogenic claudication can usually be distinguished from vascular claudication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80902 \">table 5</a>). Rare patients develop a cauda equina syndrome. Patients often have symptoms only when active. Most patients with spinal stenosis related to osteoarthritis will have stable symptoms over time.

Pain is typically exacerbated by activity and relieved by rest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73969 \">table 6</a>).
