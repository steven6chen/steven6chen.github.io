The assessment of neonatal pain is discussed separately.

Professional bodies and parent groups expect health care providers to prevent infants from experiencing pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Varying degrees of neonatal discomfort or pain may occur during routine patient care (eg, gavage tube placement, bladder catheterization, or physical examination) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], moderately invasive procedures (eg, suctioning, phlebotomy, or peripheral intravenous [IV] access), or more invasive procedures (eg, chest tube placement, circumcision, or central venous access). Pain is most common and intense in infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Infants admitted to the NICU frequently experience acute pain from skin-breaking procedures, established pain following surgery, and prolonged (chronic) pain from diseases like necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or epidermolysis bullosa. However, despite ongoing efforts, there remains no consistent definition for prolonged or chronic pain in newborn infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In part due to the lack of consensus regarding the definition of persistent neonatal pain, it appears that only 10 percent of neonates received daily assessments for prolonged continuous pain in the NICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Nonpharmacologic measures (breastfeeding, non-nutritive sucking, swaddling or facilitated tucking, and skin-to-skin contact) and pharmacologic agents (oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucrose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sucrose</a>, eutectic mixture of local anesthetics [EMLA] cream, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a>, opioids, and sedatives) are used for neonatal analgesic control. Therapy, including combination of interventions, is dependent upon the specific procedure performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75338\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75338 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Analgesia for specific procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We employ the following stepwise approach in the management of neonatal pain depending on the clinical setting, which is based on published data and our clinical experience:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest using nonpharmacologic measures (eg, facilitated tucking or skin-to-skin contact) to improve analgesia for any painful procedure, when feasible (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Other measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For neonates undergoing a brief needlestick (eg, heel stick, venipuncture), we recommend oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucrose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sucrose</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This can be combined with nonpharmacologic measures such as non-nutritive sucking, facilitated tucking, or skin-to-skin contact. Alternatives to oral sucrose include breastfeeding, breast milk, or glucose. In this setting, we do not recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1056045666\" class=\"local\">'Oral sucrose or glucose'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Acetaminophen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For neonates undergoing a more prolonged or painful skin-breaking procedure (arterial puncture, arterial or venous line placement, or lumbar puncture [LP]), in addition to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucrose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sucrose</a>, we suggest the use of a topical anesthetic cream (eg, EMLA) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Topical anesthetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For male neonatal circumcision, in addition to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucrose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sucrose</a>, we suggest ring block or dorsal penile nerve block rather than topical anesthetic cream (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Systemic analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend that neonates receive postoperative analgesia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This is generally accomplished with a combination of nonpharmacologic approaches, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a>, and opioid therapy. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Systemic analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We do not recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a> infusions for routine sedation or pain control in ventilated neonates (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
