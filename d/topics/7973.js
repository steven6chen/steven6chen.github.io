Of these, fractures to bones of the distal row (trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, hamate) are less frequent than fractures of the bones of the proximal row (scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, and pisiform). Hamate fractures account for 2 to 4 percent of the carpal fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>This topic will review fractures of the hamate in adults. An overview of carpal fractures and reviews of common wrist injuries in adults are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-radius-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal radius fractures in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomy of the wrist is discussed in detail separately; aspects relevant to hamate fractures are reviewed briefly below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-basic-biomechanics-of-the-wrist\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and basic biomechanics of the wrist&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The body of the hamate articulates distally with the bases of the fourth and fifth metacarpals, radially with the capitate and proximally with the triquetrum and lunate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70211\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70211 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69097\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69097 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78359 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53465\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53465 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63301 \">figure 4</a>). The hook of the hamate (hamulus), which protrudes in a palmar direction, represents the distal border of Guyon's canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57601 \">figure 5</a>), which contains the ulnar artery and nerve, and provides the attachment of the ulnar aspect of the transverse carpal ligament, which forms the roof of the carpal tunnel. Fractures involving the hamate, particularly the hook, can injure branches of the ulnar artery and nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105428\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105428 \">image 2</a>), and thus, it is important to ensure that blood flow and sensation is intact in the little and ring fingers. The ulnar nerve also supplies the intrinsic hand muscles, with the distal most innervation involving the dorsal interosseous muscle of the index finger (index finger abduction). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and examination findings'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21184617\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>The blood supply to the hook of the hamate is variable and in some cases tenuous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although the incidence of nonunion with fractures involving the hook is not known, the risk is increased in patients with a tenuous blood supply.</p><p>The hook of the hamate develops from an ossification center separate from the body of the hamate. In some adults the hook persists as the os hamulus proprium. This normal variant can present a potential diagnostic pitfall if misinterpreted as a hamate fracture. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY AND MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the hamate hook are more common than fractures elsewhere in the bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. These often result from a fall onto an outstretched hand that puts tension on the transverse carpal ligament and causes avulsion of the hook from the body. In sports, fracture of the hook can occur when the end of a golf club, racquet, or bat is forced into the palm, exerting direct pressure on the hypothenar eminence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The fracture typically occurs in the nondominant hand in golfers and batters, but the dominant hand in players of racquet sports (eg, tennis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Hamate hook fractures are prevalent in underwater rugby players due to repeated palming of the ball [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and can develop in climbers from chronic tension of the finger flexors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Stress fractures of the hamate hook have been reported in participants of climbing, ice hockey, and tennis, and exercisers performing repetitive pushups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Fractures of the hamate body are less common and can occur from a number of mechanisms, including shear forces exerted on the wrist (which may cause a fracture-dislocation), direct blows to the ulnar aspect of the wrist, and axial loading of the wrist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Many such fractures involve significant wrist trauma and adjacent structures, such as the carpometacarpal joint, may also be injured.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain and tenderness from a hamate fracture is usually localized over the hypothenar eminence but may be more diffuse over the volar surface of the wrist or proximal hand; swelling may be minimal or absent. Patients often complain of persistent pain at the base of the hypothenar eminence when gripping objects, and possibly pain with flexion of the ring or small finger. Hamate fractures are sometimes misdiagnosed as a wrist sprain due to these relatively mild symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The hamate can be palpated on the palmar side of the hand by placing the tip of your thumb on the prominent pisiform bone located at the ulnar aspect just distal to the wrist crease. From there, slide your thumb 1 to 2 cm toward the space between the index and middle fingers. The hook is appreciated as a small bony prominence. Palpation of the hamate bone is described in the attached picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86753\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86753 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The hook of hamate pull test (HHPT) is a method for identifying acute or chronic fractures of the hamulus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90034\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90034 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. To perform the test, the patient's hand is placed palm up on an examination table with the wrist in full active ulnar deviation, and the ring and little fingers flexed. The examiner then resists the patient's active flexion (of the digitorum profundus) in these two fingers. During the maneuver, pain focused at the hook of the hamate region (and sometimes radiating into the palm or wrist) suggests fracture of the hamulus. The HHPT has been described in two small series of acute and chronic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], and further study is needed to determine its accuracy.</p><p>If a hamate fracture has compromised Guyon's canal and injured the ulnar nerve, the patient may complain of paresthesias and manifest impaired sensation in the ring and little fingers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired motor function of the intrinsic hand muscles supplied by the nerve (hypothenar, interossei, lumbricals of middle and ring fingers, and adductor pollicis). Thus, depending upon which parts of the ulnar nerve are injured, weakness may be noted with little and ring finger flexion, abduction, or adduction, or thumb adduction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulnar-neuropathy-at-the-elbow-and-wrist#H87963063\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow and wrist&quot;, section on 'Ulnar neuropathy at the wrist'</a>.)</p><p>Concomitant arterial injury may cause pallor along the ulnar border of the hand, although this is unlikely as collateral circulation from the palmar arch typically provides flow to this area. The examination should include assessments of capillary refill and ulnar artery patency using the Allen test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79685\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79685 \">picture 2</a>). Embolization or vessel spasm resulting from ulnar artery injury may cause ischemic changes, a phenomenon known as the &quot;hypothenar hammer syndrome.&quot; However, this uncommon phenomenon is more often the result of repetitive minor trauma to the hypothenar region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon#H25285646\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;, section on 'Secondary Raynaud phenomenon'</a>.)</p><p>Fractures involving only the hook may be less symptomatic, leading patients to believe the injury is only a bruised hand, which may delay presentation until chronic pain prompts self-referral. In this case, delayed union is common and close follow-up is needed, generally with a hand surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial imaging obtained when a hamate or other wrist fracture is suspected includes standard anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views of the wrist. If standard views are unrevealing, special views, such as hamate or carpal tunnel views (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81015\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81015 \">image 3</a>) or an oblique view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105426\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105426 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F107984\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107984 \">picture 3</a>), can be obtained. Advanced imaging is often needed to identify hook fractures.</p><p>Fractures or dislocations of the hamate body can usually be seen on standard AP or lateral plain radiographs of the wrist or hand. An AP or oblique view may show small avulsion (&quot;flake&quot;) fractures from the distal articular surface just proximal to the base of the fifth metacarpal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66660\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66660 \">image 5</a>).</p><p>Fractures of the hook can be difficult to see on standard plain radiographs and special views are generally needed. These include a 20 degree supinated lateral view and a carpal tunnel view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59836\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59836 \">image 6</a>), in which the wrist is maximally extended and the x-ray tube angled 25 degrees inferiorly from the plane of the palm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/2,3,5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5,12</a>]. The sensitivity of plain radiographs for hook fractures is only 53 to 90 percent, using computed tomography (CT) as the reference standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>If suspicion is high and plain film radiographs are inconclusive, a CT scan of the wrist should be obtained for definitive diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although studies are limited by small numbers, CT appears to be highly sensitive and specific, and can be especially helpful in visualizing the base of the hook when the patient cannot adequately extend the wrist because of pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105427\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105427 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60282%7EEM%2F75387\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60282 graphicRef75387 \">image 8A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered sensitive for hamate body and hook fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105430\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105430 \">image 9</a>) and has the advantage of detecting concomitant soft tissue injuries, but it is more expensive than other modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>As noted above, the hamate hook ossifies independently from the body of the hamate. A separate bone known as the os hamulus proprium may be present in some adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. When the hamate is bipartite, the radiolucent region separating the hook from the body is typically smooth and the margins are uniformly calcified. In contrast, in the case of a hamate fracture, the edges of the fragments are typically linear or jagged and the cortical or subchondral bone is disrupted. If there is any doubt, views of the uninjured wrist may be valuable for comparison, or thin-cut CT or MRI can be used to assess further.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2395729\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hamate fracture is definitively diagnosed by diagnostic imaging. A presumptive diagnosis is made based upon a history of trauma to the ulnar or hypothenar region of the wrist and hand, and the presence of focal tenderness in the area of the hamate. Fractures involving only the hook may be less symptomatic, leading patients to believe the injury is only a bruised hand, which may delay presentation until chronic pain prompts self-referral. Plain radiographs are sufficient in most instances to identify a hamate body fracture, but computed tomography (CT) may be needed if radiographs are negative and clinical suspicion persists, or if a hook fracture is present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2395735\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnoses that may coincide or be confused with a hamate fracture include those described below. The differential diagnosis for acute wrist pain is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H117505928\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture of other carpal bones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulnar sided wrist pain following trauma may be due to a fracture of the pisiform, triquetrum, lunate, capitate, or any combination of these bones. Tenderness may be diffuse at the ulnar aspect of the wrist. Diagnostic imaging to identify such fractures should include standard and carpal tunnel wrist views, and advanced imaging may be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H117505952\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture-dislocations of carpal bones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These potentially catastrophic injuries may be sustained from trauma, generally involving significant force, and must be diagnosed quickly to avoid possible neurovascular injury and osteoarthritis. Examination often but not always reveals wrist deformity; definitive diagnosis is made with radiographs. Depending upon the extent of injury, immediate or urgent orthopedic consultation is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain#H26912264\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain&quot;, section on 'Perilunate and lunate dislocations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H117505959\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal radius fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hamate fractures accompany 1 to 2 percent of distal radius fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Such injuries are suspected on the basis of the history (usually a fall onto an outstretched hand) and examination findings (focal tenderness and deformity of the distal forearm or wrist). Imaging studies, beginning with anteroposterior and lateral views of the wrist, establish the diagnosis in most cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-radius-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal radius fractures in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H117505922\"><span class=\"h2\">Metacarpal fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injuries sustained from punching an object or person can fracture both the metacarpals and the hamate, or result in complex hamate-metacarpal fracture-dislocations or isolated metacarpal fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Fractures of the bases of the fourth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fifth metacarpals can present as ulnar sided wrist and hand pain. Tenderness is typically present along the dorsal and palmar hand in the region of the injury. Diagnosis is confirmed with plain radiographs. Treatment usually requires operative intervention, so orthopedic consultation is advised. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-metacarpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of metacarpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H117505915\"><span class=\"h2\">Wrist sprain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of fracture or dislocation, sprain of any of the many wrist ligaments and capsule is likely after acute trauma. Examination typically reveals wrist tenderness and often swelling, but plain radiographs are negative. Advanced imaging may be needed to definitively rule out a fracture. Treatment involves a period of immobilization and rehabilitation once healing is adequate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain#H3002805\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain&quot;, section on 'Wrist sprain'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H117505908\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothenar hammer syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repetitive stress injury to the hypothenar eminence from biking, handball, martial arts, and other activities can lead to chronic injury to the ulnar artery in the region of Guyon's canal. Such chronic stress results in arterial constriction and thickening, and possibly thrombosis or aneurysm. Symptoms can include pain in the palm or ulnar digits and cold intolerance. The Allen test may show absent or delayed filling from the ulnar artery. Surgical treatment may be needed.

Evaluation of the ulnar nerve and artery are particularly important in this regard. In addition, if there is any evidence of flexor tendon injury associated with an acute fracture during the initial evaluation, the patient should be referred. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and examination findings'</a> above.)</p><p>Acute hamate hook fractures in those with need for rapid return to work or play often require surgical consultation. Conservative treatment requires prolonged immobilization, and some persons may not tolerate this for comfort or financial reasons. Optimal management of an acute hamate hook fracture is uncertain. Some authors recommend excision or mini-screw fixation, while others recommend at least a trial of immobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/5,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26-28</a>]. Competitive athletes and those in occupations requiring grip strength often proceed with surgical excision at the outset because of pressure to return to full activity as soon as possible (ie, not waiting for four to six weeks to see if they will heal with immobilization).</p><p>Although clear guidelines are lacking, hamate hook fractures that present after a delay in diagnosis (greater than six weeks) may be at increased risk for nonunion, and referral to a hand surgeon is reasonable. Unfortunately, this is a common occurrence; the average delay to diagnosis for hook fractures is over five months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Patients who have been managed appropriately with immobilization but fail to heal should be referred for excision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55997999\"><span class=\"h2\">Basic care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hamate hook fractures or displaced hamate body fractures that are being referred for operative consideration can be protected in a volar splint until reassessed by the surgeon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65696\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65696 \">figure 7</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> above.)</p><p>The short arm cast should be properly positioned and should include the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of the ring and little fingers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The wrist should be placed in slight flexion to reduce tension on the hook from the small and ring fingers. The MCP joints should be placed in flexion (close to 90 degrees) to prevent shortening of the collateral ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80299\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80299 \">figure 8</a>), and thus minimize the loss of motion that can result from prolonged immobilization of the MCP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21184617\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hamate fractures are infrequently accompanied by complications.

Radiographs can be repeated at two to three week intervals to assess the progress of healing. The absence of tenderness and radiographic signs of healing (eg, callus formation) are used to determine whether the fracture has healed.</p><p>According to small case reports, delayed union and nonunion of hamate hook fractures have been successfully treated with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and without immobilization, but reported times to healing were 8, 12, and 36 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

Manual laborers and athletes who have undergone operative intervention should be restricted from active participation until after four to six weeks of immobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Following excision of the hook of hamate, patients generally can return to full activities in four to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/5,27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,27,31</a>]. High-level amateur athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] and competitive baseball players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] treated with surgical hook excision returned to full participation in sports an average of six weeks after surgery, with no complications and high satisfaction rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamate-fractures/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>An aggressive attempt to increase wrist motion is begun once casting is removed and pain has subsided. Protective splinting should be continued for three months (and possibly longer) until full pain-free motion and strength have been regained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures of the hook of the hamate are more common than fractures of the body. Hook fractures often result from a fall on the outstretched hand or in sports can occur when the end of a golf club, racquet, or bat is forced into the palm. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'History and mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain and tenderness from a hamate fracture is usually localized over the hypothenar eminence; swelling may be minimal or absent. Patients often complain of persistent pain at the base of the hypothenar eminence when gripping objects. Hamate fractures are sometimes misdiagnosed as a wrist sprain. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and examination findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of the hamate includes direct palpation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86753\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86753 \">picture 1</a>) and the hook of hamate pull test. Guyon's Canal is adjacent to the hook, and thus the examination must include an assessment for damage to the ulnar artery or nerve when a hook fracture occurs. This includes performing the Allen test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79685\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79685 \">picture 2</a>) and assessing little and ring finger strength and sensation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hamate fracture is definitively diagnosed by radiograph. Body fractures can typically be seen with standard anteroposterior and lateral plain radiographs of the hand and wrist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66660\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66660 \">image 5</a>), but the hook is best visualized with a carpal tunnel view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59836\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59836 \">image 6</a>) or a lateral view with the wrist in 20 degrees of supination. Computed tomography (CT) may be needed if radiographs are negative but clinical suspicion persists. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fracture of other carpal bones, especially the scaphoid, or the distal radius is more common in acute wrist injury than a hamate fracture. (See <a href=\"#H2395735\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All displaced fractures of the body, fractures involving subluxation or dislocations, and hook fractures where the patient cannot tolerate prolonged immobilization should be referred for operative intervention. Other indications for surgical referral are described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nondisplaced and avulsion fractures of the body and certain cases of hook fracture are treated with a short arm cast (with ring and little fingers included) for four to six weeks, or possibly longer with hook fractures. Protection during sports using some type of splint continues for three months afterward. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Return to sport or work'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Eiff MP, Hatch RL.
