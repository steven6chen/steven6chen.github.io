(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, there are circumstances, such as acute illnesses, when glucose metabolism is significantly altered, requiring additional monitoring of blood glucose and ketones <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adjustment of the child's daily insulin dose. The school or daycare setting also presents challenges in the management of the insulin-dependent child.</p><p>Managing the child or adolescent with type 1 diabetes in settings with altered insulin requirements and at school or daycare is reviewed here.

These hormones, which include epinephrine and cortisol, raise peripheral insulin resistance, thereby increasing insulin requirements. Increased insulin resistance may persist for a few days after recovery from the acute illness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased insulin requirements are due to reduced oral intake of carbohydrates because of decreased appetite, nausea, or vomiting.</p><p/><p>Thus, a child with type 1 diabetes during an acute illness can develop:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoglycemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant hyperglycemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to inadequate insulin supplementation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ketosis independent of hyperglycemia</p><p/><p>Sick-day management is directed towards prevention of the above complications and should not be left solely in the hands of the child or adolescent. Parental involvement is imperative to avoid these diabetic complications. Telephone management with the diabetes care team is helpful in the care of these patients.</p><p>Management includes the following, as outlined in a guideline from the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) on sick-day management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/special-situations-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring (eg, every two to three hours; this may be increased to every one to two hours if necessary). Alternatively, use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), if available, can be particularly helpful for sick-day management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Continuous glucose monitoring'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Checking for urinary ketones with each void, regardless of blood glucose concentration. Ketone formation can occur without hyperglycemia, especially if oral intake is poor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Home testing of blood for beta-hydroxybutyrate may permit earlier detection of ketosis than use of urinary strips (which measure acetone and acetoacetate). Blood testing for beta-hydroxybutyrate is particularly useful for early detection of ketoacidosis in children on a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, for which only rapid-acting insulin is used. If blood ketone testing is available, we suggest performing this test each time blood glucose is tested during sick-day management. Because blood beta-hydroxybutyrate converts to acetoacetate during recovery and may therefore decrease more quickly than acetoacetate measured in urine, checking blood rather than urine for ketones could theoretically prevent overtreatment with insulin and subsequent hypoglycemia as the child recovers. This has not been shown to be important clinically. The blood testing strips also may be more effective because they are used by families more readily than the urine testing strips. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin requirements may be either increased or decreased, and the dose should be adjusted as needed based on frequent measurements of blood glucose and blood or urinary ketones. Detailed recommendations for insulin dosing are outlined in the <a href=\"http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.ispad.org/resource/resmgr/Docs/CPCG_2014_CHAP_13.pdf&amp;token=qYzpJK25mqz/P03HdQbjF7MlbD07DbAC/d69toO1pnfAVhTYjnMchh5t6mOuSv0ASCOBaXNLALE7i6cvHTpdKjpcrFiRv8zaaf3kzI6WNdNp2umA5mgStMZT7zG7SGzn&amp;TOPIC_ID=5819\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ISPAD guideline</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/special-situations-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Additional doses of rapid-acting insulin (lispro, aspart, or glulisine) or short-acting (regular) insulin should be given for elevated blood glucose or urine ketones (if blood glucose is not low) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61880 \">table 1</a>): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with hyperglycemia and absent or a small amount of urinary ketones (or blood ketones 0.6 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> we suggest administering insulin at a dose of 0.05 to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> (5 to 10 percent of the total daily dose), given every two to four hours as needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with moderate to large urinary ketones (or blood ketones &gt;1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> we suggest administering insulin at a dose of 0.1 to 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg</span> (10 to 20 percent of total daily dose) every two to four hours as needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">When using rapid-acting insulin, consider checking blood glucose and ketones after two hours, and supplementing again if necessary, rather than waiting four hours. These insulins have a duration of peak action of about two hours, and effective duration of action of three to five hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduction of insulin dose to avoid hypoglycemia, if the child is unable to ingest the required amount of carbohydrates and blood glucose concentration is not high. Even if the child is not eating, <strong>insulin should not be stopped</strong>, to maintain glucose metabolism (except perhaps briefly in unusual situations, as noted below). Management is dependent on the insulin regimen used by the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Insulin'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For children on intensive therapy (with a long-acting basal insulin such as glargine or levemir plus multiple daily injections of rapid-acting insulin, or insulin pump therapy), the basal dose can be continued at the usual rate or decreased by 10 to 20 percent. Further reductions in the basal insulin dose may be necessary if low blood glucose persists (&lt;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> despite the initial dose reduction. Insulin should typically not be discontinued as this may lead to DKA because insulin requirements, although decreased, are not completely eliminated. There are uncommon circumstances when suspending insulin infusion briefly may be necessary. For example, if blood glucose is &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&lt;3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and the child is on an insulin pump, basal insulin delivery may be suspended until blood glucose increases to &gt;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> with the help of oral carbohydrates <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mini-doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In rare instances of children treated with a fixed schedule that includes intermediate acting-insulin (NPH), the daily dose(s) of the intermediate-acting insulin can be reduced by 30 to 50 percent.</p><p/><p>With either regimen, increased blood glucose can be treated with rapid- or short-acting insulin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ketonuria with hypoglycemia is not uncommon, especially in young children, if oral intake has been deficient. These patients should be treated with an increased intake of carbohydrate-containing fluids and insulin as necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are unable to eat and have hypoglycemia should be given ice cold, sugar-containing liquids, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a> in very low doses (0.1 to 0.2 mg subcutaneously every hour for up to two doses). However, if vomiting persists or home therapy cannot correct hypoglycemia, the patient should be evaluated and treated at an appropriate medical facility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications and screening in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Hypoglycemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral hydration should be maintained with fluids that contain both carbohydrates and electrolytes. However, if adequate oral hydration cannot be maintained, especially if ketosis is present, the patient should be evaluated and treated at an appropriate medical facility. These patients may require intravenous fluids and additional insulin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and complications of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with diabetes who require medical, dental, and surgical procedures, glycemic management can be complicated by factors that affect insulin requirements, such as a period of medically mandated fasting (NPO), anesthesia, and stress. Withholding oral intake will decrease insulin requirements, while stress may increase insulin needs because of increased peripheral insulin resistance. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Sick-day management'</a> above.)</p><p>If the procedure requires a period of fasting, it is preferable to have the patient scheduled as the first case of the day to minimize the duration of fasting. Blood glucose monitoring should be performed every one to two hours while the patient is fasting.</p><p>Insulin management is dependent on the insulin regimen used by the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Insulin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children using an intensive insulin regimen with a basal insulin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">insulin glargine</a> or insulin pump), the usual basal rate should be maintained. If the child is on a pump with multiple basal rates over a 24-hour period, the lowest basal rate should typically be maintained. During and after the procedure, rapid- or short-acting insulin can be used to cover additional insulin needs as determined by blood glucose concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61880 \">table 1</a>). Intravenous dextrose should be administered if blood glucose decreases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children using a conventional insulin regimen with a fixed schedule of an intermediate-acting insulin (eg, NPH), patients should receive two-thirds of their usual intermediate-acting insulin dose and no rapid- or short-acting insulin before the procedure. During and after the procedure, rapid- or short-acting insulin can be used to cover additional insulin needs as determined by blood glucose concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61880 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p>During long procedures, switching from the usual conventional regimen to an infusion of intravenous insulin administrated at a rate of 0.02 to 0.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour and 5 percent dextrose with electrolytes has been used successfully to maintain glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/special-situations-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Ongoing blood glucose monitoring every one to two hours permits adjustment of the insulin infusion rate to avoid hypo- or hyperglycemia. Adjustment of insulin dosing for medical procedures is similar to that for sick-day management, as outlined in the section above. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Sick-day management'</a> above.) </p><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of blood glucose in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAVEL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children who travel large distances and cross multiple time zones, an intensive insulin <span class=\"nowrap\">basal/bolus</span> regimen (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">insulin glargine</a> with <span class=\"nowrap\">lispro/aspart</span> or the insulin pump) simplifies care.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple dose injections &ndash; The long-acting insulin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">insulin glargine</a>) that provides the basal insulin dose should continue to be administered at the time that the child would have received this injection in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> home time zone. If the child is advancing time zones by more than two hours for an extended time period, the family can adjust the time of insulin glargine injections by two hours each day to a time that is more appropriate for the new time zone. Doses of rapid- and short-acting insulin should be given before meals and snacks, as usual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management is more complicated in children on fixed dose regimens with NPH insulin. The child can receive additional doses of rapid- and short-acting insulin if the last dose of NPH insulin does not cover the child's insulin requirements before the next scheduled administered NPH dose, usually at the child's next breakfast or dinner. The next dose of NPH should be held until before this meal, when it should be administered with rapid- and short-acting insulin at the dose the child would have received before the meal in question while at home.</p><p/><p>During air travel, insulin (and other diabetes care) supplies should be transported as carry-on luggage. Insulin should be protected (but not frozen) in a cooler during long trips where heat exposure is likely. After initial use insulin should be stored at ambient temperature 59 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit or 15 to 30 degrees Celsius. The newer insulins are particularly heat sensitive. All medications and syringes should have original pharmacy labels; a letter from the health care facility stating that such equipment is necessary will speed the child through airport screening and customs. Food and carbohydrate-containing preparations like glucose tablets should be carried on the plane to protect against hypoglycemia in case of long delays with unavailability of food or carbohydrate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SCHOOL AND DAYCARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children can spend up to 8 to 10 hours a day at school or extended daycare. The overall goals for children in these settings are to maintain excellent glycemic control, minimize interruptions of their daily learning, prevent complications, and prevent or eliminate any stigmatization related to their disease. Children must be allowed to check blood glucose levels, give insulin injections under the supervision of a knowledgeable adult, and be treated for hypoglycemia in close proximity to the school classroom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/special-situations-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In one study of 58 children and their parents, better glycemic control was demonstrated in children who had greater flexibility in performing diabetes care at school and who attended schools where school personnel received diabetes training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/special-situations-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A school staff member, preferably a school nurse if available, needs to be identified and appropriately trained. The adult supervisor is responsible for successful implementation of daily care, based on school orders provided by the child's physician, including insulin administration, timing and content of meals, physical education classes, and any additional sport activities.

These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute illness &ndash; Children with diabetes who are acutely ill can develop hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia and ketosis because of changing insulin requirements. Because of the inability to predict the ill child's insulin requirement, the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased and ketones should be measured frequently in blood (as beta-hydroxybutyrate) or urine. Even if the child is not eating, <strong>insulin generally should not be stopped</strong>, to maintain glucose metabolism. Adjustments of insulin therapy and dietary manipulations are dependent on blood glucose concentrations, the presence of ketones, and the ability of the child to consume adequate carbohydrates and fluids. Additional doses of rapid- or short-acting insulin should be given for elevated blood glucose and urine or blood ketones. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Sick-day management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical procedures &ndash; In patients with diabetes requiring medical, dental, and surgical procedures, glycemic management can be complicated by factors that affect insulin requirements, such as the duration for which oral intake is curtailed, the use of anesthesia, and presence of stress. Adjustments of insulin therapy are dependent on the insulin regimen used by the patient (intensive regimen with <span class=\"nowrap\">basal/bolus</span> dosing or insulin pump, versus a fixed insulin schedule). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Medical procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travel &ndash; Travel across multiple time zones can require adjustment of insulin therapy and is dependent on the child's insulin regimen. During air travel, insulin and other diabetes care supplies should be transported as carry-on luggage. After initial use, insulin should be stored at ambient temperature 59 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit or 15 to 30 degrees Celsius. Insulin should be protected (but not frozen) in a cooler during long trips where heat exposure is likely because insulin preparations are heat sensitive. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Travel'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The care of diabetic children in school or daycare requires the following (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'School and daycare'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Information resources'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An adult staff person, preferably a nurse, should be identified and trained to provide care and supervision to the diabetic child.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A daily schedule should be established that includes insulin administration, meals, physical education class, and other physical activities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Teachers and school nurses should be trained to identify and treat hypoglycemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral rapidly absorbed simple carbohydrates and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a> should be readily available to treat a hypoglycemic episode.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/special-situations-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Brink S, Joel D, Laffel L, et al.
