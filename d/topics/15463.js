It is also associated with atherosclerosis elsewhere in the body. Thus, individuals with PAD are at significantly increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and mortality.</p><p>There is substantial evidence that the majority of cases of PAD go undetected in routine clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. As a result, there is considerable interest in detection of PAD through routine screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. However, a systematic review of guidelines for peripheral artery disease screening found divergent recommendations among the eight screening guidelines identified from major organizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the absence of a randomized trial evaluating outcomes of screening in asymptomatic individuals, critical questions regarding the objectives of screening, appropriateness of screening, and optimal approach to screening need to be addressed.</p><p>This topic will review the rationale and recommendations for screening for PAD with a focus on the use of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) as a screening test. Clinical features of lower extremity PAD and noninvasive diagnostic tests for PAD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2945137\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE OF PAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 20 percent of adults older than 55 years have peripheral artery disease (PAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], although estimates of the prevalence of PAD vary widely. Worldwide, the estimated prevalence in high-income countries ranged from 5.3 percent (for individuals 45 to 49 years of age) to 18.5 percent (for individuals 85 to 89 years old) in data collected from 2000 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A large study in the United States that was conducted in 1999 to 2004 estimated that about 7.1 million community-dwelling Americans were diagnosed with PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Globally, it is estimated that over 200 million people have PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. The incidence of PAD reportedly increased significantly over the preceding decade (by 28.7 percent in low- and middle-income countries, and by 13 percent in high-income countries).</p><p>It is well documented that undiagnosed PAD is common. In a study of almost 7000 primary care patients ages 70 years or older or 50 to 69 years with risk factors for atherosclerosis (history of cigarette use or diabetes), PAD was identified in 29 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Over half of these cases were new diagnoses found by ankle-brachial index (ABI) screening during the study; the remainder of the patients with PAD had prior documentation of the diagnosis. The prevalence of asymptomatic PAD in generally healthy populations, compared with clinic populations, is significantly lower. In a study sample of 1017 adults aged 60 to 69 years (average age 66 years) that excluded individuals with major chronic disease but did include smokers and patients with diabetes, the prevalence of PAD by ABI screening (ABI &lt;0.90) was 2 percent, but the prevalence was 6.6 percent in current smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Primary care clinicians are often unaware that patients have PAD, even when the patient is aware of his or her diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Classic claudication symptoms are found in only a minority of patients with PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Classic intermittent claudication is defined as exertional calf pain that causes a person to stop walking and resolves within 10 minutes of rest. In a report of 460 consecutive PAD patients, only 32 percent had classic intermittent claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Twenty percent had no exertional leg pain and almost half (48 percent) had atypical symptoms, such as rest and exertional leg pain, leg pain other than in the calf, pain that did not cause the patient to stop walking, or pain that lasted more than 10 minutes after cessation of exercise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Asymptomatic patients with PAD may simply be more sedentary than those with intermittent claudication symptoms. Support for this hypothesis was provided by a study of patients with PAD in which those who never experienced symptoms had poorer functional performance and poorer quality of life than patients with PAD and exertional leg pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1053330050\"><span class=\"h2\">Ankle-brachial index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings from clinical examination (eg, skin temperature, peripheral pulses, or bruits) have poor sensitivity in the detection of PAD in asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a simple, accurate, and relatively inexpensive test that assesses the ratio of systolic pressures in the lower versus upper extremities using Doppler ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Techniques for performing this assessment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ABI predicts angiography results more accurately than is possible using history and physical examination alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In patients undergoing diagnostic testing, ABI has excellent overall accuracy compared with angiography (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve = 0.95) in detecting significant PAD (stenoses &ge;50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. For patients in whom there is clinical suspicion of PAD, an ABI cutoff of &lt;0.9 has been reported to have a sensitivity ranging from 79 to 95 percent, with specificity consistently &gt;95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Little information is available on the sensitivity and specificity of ABI when used in asymptomatic patients without other known vascular disease (ie, a screening population). A modified approach to calculating ABI (using the lowest ankle pressure for each leg divided by the highest brachial pressure) has been demonstrated to have a higher positive test rate in a screening population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], but this approach requires validation and a more complete assessment of its impact on specificity and sensitivity.</p><p>The ABI is considered sufficiently accurate so that verifying the diagnosis using arterial angiography is generally not recommended.

PAD screening is one of a host of proposed tests for identification of high CVD-risk patients, including estimation of CVD risk using multivariable prediction tools, such as the Framingham CVD risk score. Other studies include C-reactive protein, apoprotein B, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subparticles, homocysteine, and computed tomography (CT) cardiac screening. The marginal utility that these tests add to widely used risk scores is unclear.

However, ABI remains an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk after adjusting for conventional risk factors and has some incremental value in assessing risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. A meta-analysis of sixteen cohort studies comparing cardiovascular risk predicted by the Framingham risk score compared with risk predicted by the ABI found that inclusion of the ABI in the cardiovascular risk stratification would lead to reclassification of risk and change in treatment recommendations, such as lipid-lowering therapy as recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines, for about one-fifth of men and one-third of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A review that included this meta-analysis and several smaller subsequent trials concluded that overall the magnitude of risk reclassification is likely to be clinically unimportant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1053330166\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTIONS FOR ASYMPTOMATIC PAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While risk factor modification is essential for all patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD; control of tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and increasing exercise), the effect of such interventions on progression of PAD per se is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2945160\"><span class=\"h2\">Intervening for PAD outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About 5 to 10 percent of individuals with asymptomatic PAD develop symptoms of PAD over five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Critical leg ischemia occurs infrequently (1 to 2 percent of patients with PAD) but is more likely to affect patients with concomitant diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Evidence suggests that smoking cessation and gradually progressive walking programs can slow disease progression and improve PAD symptoms and functional impairment for patients with symptomatic PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/8,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,37</a>]. Supervised exercise was more effective than stent revascularization for improving treadmill walking performance in a randomized trial of individuals with symptomatic PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A clinical trial of 882 men with PAD detected by screening with a claudication questionnaire and ankle-brachial index (ABI) found that, compared with &quot;usual care,&quot; a &quot;stop smoking and keep walking&quot; program resulted in about a 50 percent increase in the number of men who improved their maximum walking performance at 12-month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Whether exercise can prevent progression of PAD in truly asymptomatic patients is not clear from these data. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-claudication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of claudication&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is scant evidence whether treatment for other risk factors, such as elevated lipids and blood pressure, affects PAD onset and progression. Benefit of different lipid-lowering agents on total walking distance and pain-free walking distance was demonstrated in a meta-analysis of several small trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. One cross-sectional study found that statin therapy was associated with better ambulatory function in patients with known PAD, independent of cholesterol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>However, interventions directed at preventing PAD progression are either universally recommended (increased physical activity and smoking cessation) or are more important for CVD morbidity and mortality reduction (treatment for elevated blood pressure and dyslipidemia). There is no evidence to suggest that early revascularization in selected patients with asymptomatic PAD prevents progression to symptomatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1053329675\"><span class=\"h2\">Intervening for CVD outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious cardiovascular complications are more common than serious complications of PAD; therefore, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy, blood pressure control, and statin therapy should be primarily based upon cardiovascular risk assessment.

However, since these treatments are generally recommended for all patients with an elevated CVD risk, the benefits of PAD screening in patients with known increased risk for CVD is unclear.</p><p>Assessment for PAD has intuitive appeal for helping to guide treatment decisions for patients at intermediate risk of CVD after conventional risk factor appraisal.

For those who screened positive, pharmacotherapies and AAA repair, if appropriate, were offered. The screened group had higher rates of initiation of statins, higher rates of antiplatelet and blood pressure therapies, and higher AAA repair surgery rates than the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, because the VIVA participants appeared to have poor adherence to standard CVD prevention guidelines (eg, using statins and antiplatelet therapies and controlling blood pressure in patients with CVD risk scores &gt;7.5 percent) prior to study enrollment, it is unclear if ABI testing contributed to decreased overall mortality separate from any effect it may have had on increasing use of preventive therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2945188\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDATIONS OF OTHERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 2012 systematic review of guidelines on screening for peripheral artery disease (PAD) identified eight guidelines in English from national and international medical societies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. PAD screening for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) was advocated in five guidelines, while three found the evidence insufficient to recommend screening.

Revised recommendations were released in 2013, incorporating the potential role of ABI screening in cardiovascular risk assessment as well as outcomes related to PAD, and concluded that evidence was insufficient to determine the benefits and harms of screening for PAD and CVD risk assessment with ABI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2834713015\"><span class=\"h2\">Synthesis of evidence and recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data that have emerged since these groups last issued guidelines lend support to the link between low ABI and increased risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, and overall mortality.

Claudication is uncommon in patients with PAD. In the absence of screening, PAD is not diagnosed in more than one-half of patients who meet ABI criteria for PAD. (See <a href=\"#H1053330043\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosing PAD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rationale for screening for PAD involves both the potential to intervene to prevent progression of PAD and to decrease risk for other cardiovascular disease (CVD). The association between low ABI and risk for major cardiovascular events is well established and a low ABI is an independent risk factor.

A randomized trial of aspirin in patients with asymptomatic PAD did not reduce rates of coronary events, stroke, or revascularization. It is not known if statin therapy will benefit individuals who have a positive ABI screening but whose CVD risk is low by conventional risk factors (such as Framingham CVD Risk Score). It is uncertain if ABI adds to conventional CVD risk assessment methods and how ABI compares with other interventions to supplement conventional CVD risk assessment, such as measuring the coronary calcium score.
