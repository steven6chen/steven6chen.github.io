Multiple pathways have been implicated in the development of bone metastases. Bone undergoes constant remodeling, maintaining a dynamic balance between osteoclastic (resorptive) and osteoblastic (bone-forming) activity. As a metastatic focus (which is more often in the marrow than in cortical bone (see <a href=\"#H2002101208\" class=\"local\">'Distribution'</a> below)) enlarges, osteoclastic and osteoblastic reactive changes occur simultaneously:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once cancer cells are established in the bone, interaction of the tumor cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts create a vicious cycle that increases bone turnover, leading to osteolytic destruction while promoting the survival of malignant tumor cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F95886\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95886 \">figure 1</a>). Activated osteoblasts stimulate production of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) ligand (RANKL), which interacts with RANK receptors to activate osteoclasts. These activated osteoclasts then resorb bone, which results in osteolysis with concomitant release of growth factors to induce tumor growth. The osteoblastic component of a lytic metastasis represents the reaction of normal bone to the metastatic process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-bone-metastases#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of bone metastases&quot;, section on 'Osteolytic metastases'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanism of osteoblastic metastasis is not well understood, but tumor factors, such as tumor-derived peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1), may be implicated in some solid tumors, such as prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Osteolytic metastases are more likely to cause symptomatic complications, such as pathologic fractures, and thus, are more likely to manifest themselves earlier than osteoblastic metastases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2002100094\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone is one of the most common sites of distant metastases from cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At postmortem, 70 to 90 percent of patients with breast or prostate cancer have some form of skeletal metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among solid cancers, breast, prostate, lung, thyroid, and kidney cancer account for 80 percent of all skeletal metastases.

In general, outside of a clinical trial setting, there is usually no reason to scan for bone metastases in the absence of symptoms unless routine laboratory studies indicate an elevated alkaline phosphatase or an elevated calcium level. In those cases, further evaluation with a fractionated alkaline phosphatase test (liver versus bone) would be indicated and could lead to further diagnostic imaging. Hypercalcemia might prompt further diagnostic evaluation as well. Hypercalcemia occurs more commonly in patients with osteolytic than with osteoblastic metastases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests#H19404964\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;, section on 'Elevated alkaline phosphatase'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to hypercalcemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypercalcemia-of-malignancy-mechanisms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypercalcemia of malignancy: Mechanisms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For symptomatic patients, pain is the most common symptom, and many patients with bone metastasis experience significant pain at some point in their disease course.</p><p>The characteristics and intensity of the pain may vary depending on the presence or absence of neuromas as part of tumor-induced bone remodeling, endosteal nerve compression by tumor, nerve injury from extension of the bone metastasis out of the bone, and location of the metastasis within the bone. The character of the pain may be somatic (ie, achy, sharp, well-localized), neuropathic (ie, burning, shooting, radiating), or both. It may be constant or exacerbated by movement of the joint or involved bone (so-called &quot;incident&quot; pain). Incident pain is particularly hard to treat in these patients because it comes on and remits suddenly and may be very severe. Neuropathic pain is often worse at night. A complication, such as invasion of adjacent structures, usually results in constant, progressively worsening pain. If the structure is the epidural space, producing compression of the spinal cord, the pain is likely to be worse at night and very intense. Sudden severe pain may be caused by a pathologic fracture, and prompt evaluation, especially in patients with a history of cancer, is necessary. Pathologic fractures are more likely to occur in osteolytic as compared with osteoblastic metastases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma#H199714209\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>In the clinical setting, pain intensity is often measured simply by using a verbal rating scale (eg, &quot;mild,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; or &quot;severe&quot;) or a numeric scale (eg, &quot;how severe has your pain been, on average, during the past week, on a scale of 0 to 10, often using a visual analog scale where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain you can imagine?&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82442\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef82442 \">form 1</a>)). The classification of pain as mild, moderate, or severe using verbal or visual analog rating scales is arbitrary. Others have used the impact of pain on quality of life measures to propose a classification of pain intensity from bone metastases as mild (pain score of 1 to 5), moderate (pain score 6) or severe (pain score 7 to 10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Neurologic symptoms are not uncommon in patients with vertebral metastases, causing spinal cord compression or spinal instability. Symptoms of cord compression range from pain to neurologic deficits, including motor weakness and paralysis, sensory deficits, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and ataxia. Typically, the deficits result from soft tissue tumor compressing the spinal cord or cauda equina, rather than the pathologic fracture itself. Soft tissue expansion of bone metastasis and compression fracture may also cause nerve root impingement, leading to radiculopathy and pain.

Less commonly, metastases can be cortically-based surface lesions, although this almost always occurs in the appendicular, rather than the axial, skeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The most common locations for metastatic disease are the vertebral column, sacrum, pelvis, and proximal femurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Within the spine, the lumbar segment is most frequently involved, followed by the thoracic and cervical segments.</p><p>The distribution of bone metastases may also be influenced by the specific type of primary malignancy. As an example, metastatic disease is distinctly unusual in anatomic sites distal to the elbow in the upper extremity and distal to the knee in the lower extremity (termed acrometastasis). When bone lesions in these locations are found to be due to metastatic carcinoma, lung and renal cell cancers are the most common primary sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13163473\"><span class=\"h1\">DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of bone metastases is essential for accurate staging and optimal treatment. The goals of imaging are to identify sites of metastasis and to evaluate individual involved sites for the presence of, or the potential for, pathologic fracture and spinal cord compression. Imaging is also used to guide a biopsy, if deemed necessary.

While evaluation of the extent of epidural disease, acuity of fracture development with potential edema, and metastatic osseous involvement is best evaluated with contrast-enhanced MRI, structural integrity of the bone is best evaluated with CT. MRI also differentiates between metastasis and spondylodiscitis.

However, in the situation where the patient needs emergency surgical evaluation for oncological emergency or complication (eg, epidural spinal cord compression, spinal instability, or pathologic fracture of a weight-bearing bone with severe pain), comprehensive skeletal evaluation or staging workup may be deferred to allow prompt intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for biopsy depends on whether surgery will be performed, whether clinical diagnosis using imaging evaluation is sufficient, and whether pathological diagnosis is required to confirm metastasis. For patients with no history of cancer, biopsy of skeletal abnormality is necessary for diagnosis. For patients whose cancer is in remission, documentation of a pathologic diagnosis may be necessary if this is the first evidence of recurrence or disease progression. For patients with known history of stage IV malignancy or who were found to have other visceral metastasis on staging or restaging evaluation, clinical diagnosis with one or more imaging modalities may be sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis of bone metastasis.</p><p/><p>A stepwise approach to diagnosis and evaluation of osseous metastases in patients presenting with non-vertebral bone pain is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F104784\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104784 \">algorithm 1</a>); a separate algorithmic approach to diagnostic imaging is presented for patients with back pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F104764\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104764 \">algorithm 2</a>). </p><p>In general, for most patients with a known cancer capable of mixed lytic and blastic metastasis or pure blastic metastases, skeletal scintigraphy (bone scan) is indicated. For pure lytic tumors, such as multiple myeloma, a plain radiographic skeletal survey is indicated to screen the skeleton. For patients with lytic primary tumors, including metastatic Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (EFT), 18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose PET integrated with CT (integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">18-FDG-PET/CT)</span> is the recommended initial step.

However, because of the dire prognostic implications of metastatic disease, the possibility that the finding could represent a benign lesion (21 percent in one study of 482 patients with a single known primary malignancy who underwent biopsy of a suspicious bone lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]) and the outside possibility of a second occult primary malignancy (estimated to occur in 3 percent of cases in this same study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]), histologic confirmation of an initial site of bone metastasis is recommended. Of course, it is neither feasible nor desirable to confirm each metastatic lesion by biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a patient has a history of cancer without prior documentation of bone metastases and a confirmatory diagnosis of metastatic disease is all that is required, needle biopsy can be an excellent method to acquire enough tissue simply to document the presence of metastatic disease.

Core biopsy has higher diagnostic accuracy for determining the type, grade, and specific diagnosis of musculoskeletal tumors but may not be needed. An example of a situation in which this would be particularly helpful would be in the case of a patient with a remote estrogen receptor positive (ER+), progesterone receptor positive (PR+), and Her-2-neu positive invasive ductal breast cancer who now presents with bony metastases after a long disease-free interval. Potential hormonal therapy options for bone-only metastatic disease in this setting would be guided by knowing the molecular profile of the metastases. Open biopsy is rarely, if ever, needed.

However, biopsy of the metastatic deposit may or may not indicate the most likely source of the primary malignancy, even when sophisticated histologic techniques are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>].

Our suggested diagnostic approach for the detection of osseous metastases in patients with non-vertebral bone pain is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F104764\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104764 \">algorithm 2</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Skeletal scintigraphy, generally referred to as a &quot;bone scan,&quot; is the most widely used method to detect bone metastases because it provides visualization of the entire skeleton within a reasonable timeframe and at a reasonable cost. (See <a href=\"#H3396752\" class=\"local\">'Bone scan'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Plain film radiographs are commonly used to confirm findings seen with other imaging modalities. In addition, the whole-body radiographic bone survey is important in the staging of most patients with multiple myeloma because of poor sensitivity of bone scan in this situation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97119 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2002101453\" class=\"local\">'Plain radiographs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H355093521\" class=\"local\">'Skeletal survey'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Metabolic imaging with 18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography integrated with CT <span class=\"nowrap\">(FDG-PET/CT)</span> is often utilized for initial staging of patients with Ewing sarcoma and a lytic primary tumor, and for those with rapidly progressive metastases associated with minimal reactive bone formation. <span class=\"nowrap\">FDG-PET/CT</span> is also commonly used for staging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> restaging of solid cancers when the goal is to diagnose both osseous and extraosseous metastases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97119 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3396789\" class=\"local\">'Positron emission tomography scanning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evaluation with cross-sectional imaging may be required for the evaluation of suspected pathologic fractures; suspected epidural spinal cord compression or spinal instability; metastatic bone disease involving the shoulder, spine, or pelvis because of the complex anatomy; and if other imaging studies are equivocal and there is a strong clinical suspicion of bone metastases. Both CT and MRI are effective, but CT is probably the imaging method of choice for most patients when metastatic disease is highly likely. MRI is particularly useful for patients with spine metastases to allow evaluation of the extent of medullary and extraspinal disease, and spinal cord and nerve root compression. For suspected or newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, MRI is the gold-standard imaging for skeletal and marrow abnormality. (See <a href=\"#H2002102388\" class=\"local\">'Cross-sectional imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differential diagnosis of metastatic bone disease includes primary bone sarcomas (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma of bone), solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB), and primary lymphoma of bone (PLB). Benign bone tumors that can present as lytic lesions include hemangioma, various types of cysts, lipomas, eosinophilic granuloma, enchondroma, nonossifying fibroma, and giant cell tumor of bone. Benign conditions that may present as a solitary sclerotic bone lesion include a bone island (enostosis), calcifying enchondroma, osteoid osteoma, bone infarct, fibrous dysplasia, and Paget disease of bone. (See <a href=\"#H610058542\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive diagnosis of bone metastases requires histologic examination of biopsy material. However, tissue diagnosis may not be needed for all patients. If a patient has a history of cancer without prior documentation of bone metastases and a confirmatory diagnosis of metastatic disease is all that is required, needle biopsy is an appropriate choice. (See <a href=\"#H2002101396\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic biopsy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mundy GR.
