Because no diagnostic tests have been developed to distinguish PD from other forms of parkinsonism in vivo, PD remains a clinical diagnosis, based on the clinician's ability to recognize its characteristic signs and associated symptoms, especially in the early stages. An accurate clinical diagnosis is fundamental to the expectation that pharmacotherapy of PD will be effective. In general, the other forms of parkinsonism tend to respond poorly to antiparkinson drugs.</p><p>This topic will review the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PD. Other aspects of PD are discussed separately.

At a minimum, bradykinesia plus either tremor or rigidity must be present in order to consider the diagnosis of PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, an unequivocal, beneficial response to dopaminergic therapy is an important supportive feature of the diagnosis, while the absence of an observable response to high-dose levodopa therapy (&gt;1000 mg daily) in patients with at least a moderate severity of parkinsonism makes the diagnosis of PD extremely unlikely. Other clinical features that are supportive of the diagnosis are unilateral onset, presence of a rest tremor, and a persistent asymmetry throughout the course of the disease, with the side of onset most affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Postural instability is also a feature of PD but usually does not appear until later in the course of the disease. Thus, patients with parkinsonian signs who exhibit postural instability early in the course of the illness most likely have another parkinsonian syndrome.</p><p>There are no physiologic tests or blood tests for confirming the clinical diagnosis of PD, and neurodiagnostic testing with CT or MRI is usually unrevealing. Nevertheless, MRI is reasonable to perform in every patient to exclude rare, unexpected mimics of PD, such as stroke or hydrocephalus. While the true &quot;gold standard&quot; for a definitive diagnosis is neuropathologic examination, the &quot;gold standard&quot; for a clinical diagnosis according to criteria from the Movement Disorder Society is an expert clinician. (See <a href=\"#H130396564\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below.) </p><p>A brain MRI scan may be performed to exclude structural lesions, but is not necessary in a patient with a classic presentation of PD, no other neurologic signs, and a good response to levodopa therapy. Striatal dopamine transporter imaging (DaTscan) may also be useful for occasional patients for whom the clinical diagnosis is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Conventional MRI'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'DaTscan'</a> below.)</p><p>Referral to a specialist or center with expertise in movement disorders is advised for patients with parkinsonian signs and symptoms when the diagnosis is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130396564\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical diagnostic criteria for PD from the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F104831\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104831 \">table 1</a>) require the presence of motor parkinsonism (bradykinesia plus tremor or rigidity) as the central and essential feature of the disease (see <a href=\"#H130396718\" class=\"local\">'Parkinsonism'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The most likely explanation for diagnostic error is that other parkinsonian syndromes, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy, can mimic idiopathic PD early in the course of illness, before the later appearance of the signature symptoms, such as disordered eye movements seen with progressive supranuclear palsy or severe autonomic insufficiency that occurs with multiple system atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In addition, in studies of subjects older than age 50 years without evidence of PD or other neurodegenerative disease, hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra appears to be a risk marker for the development of PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. However, further research is necessary to establish the utility and diagnostic accuracy of this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Olfactory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Olfactory testing is considered useful for differentiating PD from other parkinsonian disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/1,51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,51-55</a>].

Other tests of autonomic function, including urodynamic testing, urethral or anal sphincter EMG, sympathetic skin responses, Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test, tilt table testing, and heart rate variability during forced respirations, have been examined as a potential tool for differentiating PD from other parkinsonian syndromes, especially multiple system atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Furthermore, parkinsonism is seen in a wide variety of other conditions (secondary parkinsonism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/20,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,59</a>]. Distinguishing PD from these parkinsonian syndromes can be difficult, particularly in the early stages of disease. Essential tremor may also be confused with PD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130394121\"><span class=\"h2\">Essential tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Essential tremor (ET) is the most common neurologic cause of action tremor, with an estimated prevalence worldwide of up to 5 percent of the population. The incidence of ET increases with age, although it often affects young individuals, especially when it is familial. The neuropathologic basis for ET is unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ET usually affects both hands and arms, and can also involve the head, voice, chin, trunk, and legs. Isolated tremor of the chin or lips is more likely to be a manifestation of PD. ET typically becomes immediately apparent in the arms when they are held outstretched or when they are engaged in activities such as writing or eating. ET is most often symmetric but can be asymmetrical or, rarely, unilateral, particularly early in the course of ET.</p><p>Differentiating the action tremor of ET from the classic resting tremor of PD should be straightforward. However, some patients with PD also have a postural-action tremor indistinguishable from ET. Likewise, patients with severe ET may have a rest component to their tremor. Furthermore, some patients with PD may have a re-emergent tremor: a postural tremor that manifests after a latency of several seconds with a frequency typical of the rest tremor in PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].

According to these criteria, dementia in PDD occurs in the setting of well-established parkinsonism more than a year after onset of motor symptoms, while in DLB, dementia usually occurs concomitantly with or before the development of parkinsonian signs or no more than a year after onset of motor symptoms. Thus, patients are classified as having PDD if parkinsonism is present for more than one year before the onset of dementia. The overlap between these two clinical entities and the uncertainty of the one-year rule continue to provoke debate about the validity of current nomenclature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

Important cognitive features of CBD include executive dysfunction, aphasia, apraxia, behavioral change, and visuospatial dysfunction, with relatively preserved episodic memory.

At a minimum, bradykinesia plus either tremor or rigidity must be present. In addition, an unequivocal, beneficial response to dopaminergic therapy is an important supportive feature of the diagnosis, while the absence of an observable response essentially rules out the diagnosis of PD. Other clinical features that are supportive of the diagnosis are unilateral onset, presence of a rest tremor, and a persistent asymmetry throughout the course of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Response to dopaminergic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical diagnostic criteria for PD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F104831\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104831 \">table 1</a>) require the presence of motor parkinsonism (bradykinesia plus tremor or rigidity) as the central and essential feature of the disease (see <a href=\"#H130396718\" class=\"local\">'Parkinsonism'</a> above). The determination that PD is the cause of motor parkinsonism requires the presence of supportive criteria (see <a href=\"#H130396576\" class=\"local\">'Supportive criteria'</a> above) to counterbalance the presence of any &quot;red flags&quot; (see <a href=\"#H130396583\" class=\"local\">'Red flags'</a> above) and requires the absence of absolute exclusion criteria (see <a href=\"#H130396618\" class=\"local\">'Absolute exclusion criteria'</a> above). The diagnosis of <strong>clinically established PD</strong>, which maximizes specificity over sensitivity, requires the presence of parkinsonism, no absolute exclusion criteria, at least two supportive criteria, and no red flags. The diagnosis of <strong>clinically probable PD</strong>, which attempts to balance sensitivity and specificity, likewise requires the presence of parkinsonism and no absolute exclusion criteria, while the presence of red flags (no more than two allowed) must be counterbalanced by an equal number of supportive criteria. (See <a href=\"#H130396564\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no diagnostic tests for PD, A brain MRI scan can be helpful to exclude structural lesions, but is not necessary in a patient with a classic presentation of PD, no other neurologic signs, and a good response to levodopa therapy. Striatal dopamine transporter imaging (DaTscan) may also be useful for occasional patients for whom the clinical diagnosis is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Conventional MRI'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'DaTscan'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of PD is extensive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58941\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58941 \">table 2</a>).

The most common of these is dementia with Lewy bodies.
