Disease complications may be exacerbated during this period due to the failure of the health care system to ensure continuity of care, resulting in increased use of emergency department (ED) and inpatient resources. Morbidity and mortality increase sharply for patients with SCD in the United States after the age of 18 years.</p><p>There is a need for a structured process of transition from pediatric to adult care for youth with SCD that is not based on random criteria such as age but rather is based on social and emotional development and achievement of milestones in disease-management knowledge and skills.</p><p>This topic describes our approach to planning and carrying out a smooth transfer from pediatric to adult care in SCD.</p><p>Related issues are discussed in separate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>SCD management</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine comprehensive care for children with sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydroxyurea use in sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Confidentiality and consent in adolescent medical care</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confidentiality in adolescent health care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=consent-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Consent in adolescent health care&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H650953230\"><span class=\"h1\">MORTALITY AND COMPLICATIONS AROUND THE TIME OF TRANSITION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H992136749\"><span class=\"h2\">Observations from cohort studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stakes for health and even survival are high for youth and young adults with SCD. There is an increase in the use of health care resources (eg, hospitalizations, emergency department [ED] visits) after the age of 18 years but more alarming is the sharp increase in mortality for young adults with SCD in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. This was illustrated in a large cohort study that included 940 children in the state of Texas who were followed from birth (representing 8857 patient-years of follow-up), in which the only deaths (n = 7) occurred within two years of transfer to adult medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a study of 22 adults with SCD who had been maintained on chronic transfusion therapy following overt stroke, eight individuals who elected to discontinue blood transfusions after transfer to adult care died within one to five years due to stroke recurrence, sudden death, or multiorgan failure. Other individuals in this study experienced transfusion complications including alloimmunization and iron overload, although they were rarely admitted for pain episodes.</p><p>In a review of Medicaid claims data for a sample of 3208 patients with SCD including children, adolescents, and adults, it was demonstrated that complications and health care costs increased significantly after age 16, while preventive therapies such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> prescription and transfusions decreased after age 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An examination of administrative data from the Pediatric Health Information System over a nine-year period also showed that costs increased for young adults with SCD (ages 18 to 21 years) compared with younger adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) hospitalized in pediatric settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3669193425\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbidities that become more likely in older adolescents and adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain morbidities of SCD become more likely as individuals age.

For youth with SCD (as with other chronic conditions), the foundation to participate fully in society and live productively as adults is laid during childhood, but experiences during the transition years (ages approximately 12 through 25 years) are especially important as they help individuals develop the knowledge, skills, and motivation to actively participate in their health care, including developing strategies for positive disease self-management.</p><p>Elements borrowed from other chronic conditions that inform indicators of successful transition in SCD include health outcomes such as decreased morbidity and mortality and stable use of health care services, including avoidance of unnecessary emergency health care visits or hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>SCD experts have suggested disease-specific additional signs that successful transition has occurred, including the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adherence to therapy regimens</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuation along a stable disease trajectory</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The disease continuing at the same severity as in pediatric care (or improving)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The patient not developing unexpected complications such as stroke</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Youth participation in preventive care and health maintenance as reflected in making outpatient clinic visits</p><p/><p>Positive outcomes in relation to quality of life include achieving appropriate developmental milestones such as obtaining postsecondary education or employment, getting married, or having children (if desired) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Youth with SCD expressed that successful transition was characterized by increasing independence in the management of their disease with fading parental control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>An expert panel of SCD providers completed a modified Delphi survey in 2017 to further refine quality indicators for successful transition in SCD and identified the following as the most important quality indicators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communication between pediatric and adult providers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First visit to adult provider within two months of the final visit with the pediatric provider</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient self-efficacy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality of life</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trust between adult providers and patients</p><p/><p>The perspectives of youth and their families on the important components of a successful transition are also important, as discussed below.

In a 2016 multisite study and a 2015 review of the literature, youth with higher self-efficacy consistently expressed that they were more ready for transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Most studies that evaluated clinical outcomes found correlations of better self-efficacy with better outcomes, although few studies assessed this correlation. Youth with higher self-efficacy reported fewer physical and psychologic symptoms, less stress, and improved outcomes, including decreased pain frequency, increased number of outpatient health care visits maintained after transition, and better quality of life. In another study from 2015, adults with SCD who cited several barriers to obtaining care in the adult health care system once transitioned nevertheless reported improved self-efficacy as they improved in their self-care and autonomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4150924117\"><span class=\"h2\">Readiness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transition readiness refers to indicators that youth with SCD and their supports (eg, parents and health care providers) can begin, continue, and finish the transition and ultimate transfer process from pediatric to adult-oriented health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Clinical algorithms and toolkits developed to support successful transition stress the importance of ongoing assessment of transition readiness so that youth are guided into adulthood in a structured process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].

In either case, they should have adequate psychometric properties to allow for reliable and valid assessment. Modifiable transition readiness variables include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knowledge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-management and independent living skills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beliefs or expectations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goals and motivation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emotional status</p><p/><p>Assessment of transition readiness must be multidimensional, evaluating not only knowledge and skills in relation to disease management but also where the youth stands in relation to developmental goals of adolescence. These goals include achievement of autonomy from the family, establishment of supportive relationships, development of a comfortable body image and sense of self-esteem, adjustment to sexual maturation, and preparation for future occupational and familial goals. Assessment of emotional adjustment to the transition process and development of self-efficacy is also important.</p><p>Studies that have gathered perspectives of young adults after the transition from pediatric to adult care have identified a number of promoters of successful transition. Addressing fear of the unknown has been identified as important, such as by meeting the adult provider prior to transfer and being well-informed about what to expect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Young adults also recommended gradually taking over disease management from their parents and starting the process of transition early. In a 2017 survey of 19 young adults with SCD (ages 18 to 30), those who had completed the transition to adult care reported a history of primarily negative experiences in the adult health care system, particularly in emergency departments (EDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. They also confirmed the importance of self-efficacy, adequate knowledge, developmental maturity, acceptance, and motivation as important for successful transition.</p><p>As noted below, lack of readiness is a major barrier to a smooth transition.

In a 2009 study that combined qualitative and quantitative methods, adolescents cited having competing activities and forgetting as key barriers to adherence to clinic appointments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. There was a complex relation between health status and clinic attendance, wherein some adolescents who did not feel well were less likely to attend clinic visits, while, for others, feeling well was a barrier to attendance. Structural factors such as insurance and transportation may also impact adherence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H751787577\"><span class=\"h2\">Parental support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parental support is important to adherence but must be balanced with the need to transfer responsibilities for disease management to the youth.</p><p>During the transition process, <span class=\"nowrap\">parents/primary</span> caregivers should be coached to fade involvement at medical visits but still supervise medications and health care until the youth is able to seek out acute and preventive medical care as independently as possible. Siblings, as well, have emphasized the importance of self-management and medication adherence to successful transition for youth with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. We recognize that families remain integral supports for many adults with SCD, but families must learn to balance their advocacy role with their role in supporting the youth's development of self-advocacy skills.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4139206787\"><span class=\"h2\">Model programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Youth and families express anxiety about the transition process, even with <span class=\"nowrap\">pediatric/adult</span> medicine colocation models, as care in the ED and inpatient services often must take place in community facilities. To alleviate this anxiety, it can be helpful to offer tours of partner community facilities. It is important for SCD specialists to cultivate relationships with primary care providers willing to comanage patients and with adult SCD specialists, where available. (See <a href=\"#H712548030\" class=\"local\">'Overview of our practice'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3577763879\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient-centered medical home</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence that youth and adults receive higher-quality care when it is delivered within a patient-centered medical home (PCMH). As an example, in a cohort of over 20,000 young adults in the general population, those who received care in a PCMH were more likely to receive preventive care, immunizations, cancer screenings, and screening for sexually transmitted infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Youth cared for in the PCMH receive family-centered care from providers who know them well and are better able to anticipate their needs, including transition planning. This is especially important because SCD is a complex medical condition that requires a number of age-specific preventive strategies and ongoing assessment of milestones in relation to medical care, social development, and disease-specific knowledge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Also, as noted below, lack of trust from clinicians who are not familiar with the patient may further degrade care. (See <a href=\"#H2783914541\" class=\"local\">'Limited number of capable providers for adults with SCD'</a> below.)</p><p>In a PCMH for an individual with SCD, the pediatric provider conducts regular monitoring and comprehensive documentation of complications and treatments (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine comprehensive care for children with sickle cell disease&quot;</a>) and communicates with the adult provider as a resource for information or assistance during the immediate post-transfer period. In turn, adult providers continue comprehensive management according to the latest guidelines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H569004887\"><span class=\"h1\">BARRIERS TO SUCCESS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2783914541\"><span class=\"h2\">Limited number of capable providers for adults with SCD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major challenge to the smooth transition from pediatric to adult care in SCD is the limited availability of knowledgeable adult-oriented providers (and, hence, limited access to quality health care) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. These may be hematologists or primary care providers who are willing to take on the complexities of SCD care.</p><p>The system of care into which the youth is transitioned must be sensitive and responsive to the unique needs and challenges of young adults with SCD. Care is complex because a number of SCD comorbid conditions that are prevalent in adulthood begin in childhood; these include silent cerebral infarcts, avascular necrosis of joints, asthma, chronic sickle lung disease, and renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Without transition support and assurance of continuity of care, these conditions very likely may worsen and may seriously impact the functional ability of the young adult with SCD.</p><p>Finding knowledgeable providers who can manage adults with chronic conditions previously deemed pediatric conditions has been shown to be problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Accessing quality health care is particularly challenging for youth with SCD as they transition to adult health care. Pediatric SCD specialists reported that the inability to find an adult provider to whom they could transfer their patients was the most significant issue they faced in the transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Providers do not merely need to be knowledgeable about medical aspects of SCD care; they also need to be capable of establishing a relationship of two-way trust with the patient, especially related to pain and its management. One of the most frequently cited barriers to accessing optimal care, reported by youth in transition and adults with SCD, is negative interactions with emergency department (ED) and primary care providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/18,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,39-41</a>].</p><p>Further, pain is the hallmark manifestation of SCD, yet youth with SCD, who are primarily African American in the United States, are often questioned by health care providers about their reports of pain and are labeled as drug seekers, manipulative, or malingerers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. As a cycle of mistrust develops between youth with SCD and providers, youth may be prone to non-adherence, self-discharge from the hospital, and avoidance of the health care system altogether [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/39,40,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40,42-44</a>].</p><p>Patients with SCD report that their ED providers in particular view them as &quot;drug seekers&quot; and may be hesitant to prescribe or administer sufficient amounts of pain medications to manage severe pain episodes. ED providers in fact have been found to exhibit more negative attitudes towards patients with SCD compared with other providers, and ED providers with the highest levels of negative attitudes towards patients with SCD were less amenable to adhering to recommended pain-management guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Serious health risks ensue from these negative provider-patient interactions, wherein patients avoid seeking emergency care when needed, self-discharge prematurely from the hospital, and may be less adherent with medical regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/39,40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40,42</a>].

Our approach to transition is flexible enough to accommodate the needs of youth with serious cognitive challenges or multiple severe SCD complications, yet structured so that the youth and families move through the steps in the transition process in a uniform way [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. As noted below, the age of transfer to adult care is matched to the age at which the individual is ready to move on, with transition preparations beginning early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Transition is a multidimensional process that must occur in stages. Briefly, our practice is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inform youth and families about the process. This may include use of a brochure that introduces the transition and facilitates discussion between families and pediatric providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. This is distributed to all families in clinic beginning when the youth with SCD is 14 years of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Key information to be provided includes the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Details specific to the institutional transition process</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Differences in the culture of adult versus pediatric medicine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Role of self-advocacy in health care (as well as other areas such as school and employment)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Insurance issues</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Differences related to privacy and consent starting at the age of 18 years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other resources for providing this information, such as seminars and online tools, are listed below. (See <a href=\"#H2784983597\" class=\"local\">'Resources for patients and families'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess transition readiness of the youth and family. This is typically done by our social workers, as described below (see <a href=\"#H593371043\" class=\"local\">'Readiness assessment and age of transition'</a> below). Areas of need are reassessed until goals are reached.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coordinate communication between pediatric and adult providers. The transition can only occur once an appropriate adult provider has been identified. Pediatric providers must work with the family to identify an adult-oriented provider and must continue to support the continued growth and medical care of the young adult within the pediatric context until an appropriate adult provider is found.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our practice, pediatric and adult teams involved in SCD care are colocated in the same building, which facilitates communication. Each multidisciplinary team includes a social worker, along with nursing, primary care, and hematology support. The adult team social worker begins seeing patients at the age of 18, follows them through transition at approximately age 21 years, and continues to work with patients for the remainder of their adult years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is also a social work assistant who can provide intensive support as needed, particularly around accessing mental health services, and a patient navigator, who focuses on assisting patients navigating health insurance issues. The patients who need this additional support tend to be those with complex medical, social, psychologic, behavioral, cognitive, and resource challenges. However, not all practices will have the ability to physically locate pediatric and adult teams together, nor will all practices have the capacity to include all of these providers on the same team. In such cases, there may be extra effort required to ensure good communication between pediatric and adult teams.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An important feature of our setting is the ability to be flexible in the age at which the adolescent is transferred to adult providers. Although the majority are transferred at an age of approximately 21 years, coinciding with a change in their health insurance, some <span class=\"nowrap\">youth/young</span> adults may take longer to achieve necessary developmental, social, and disease-management milestones and so continue to work with the multidisciplinary team until they are ready for transfer at an older age. (See <a href=\"#H593371043\" class=\"local\">'Readiness assessment and age of transition'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensure that evaluation for SCD comorbidities has been completed based on age-appropriate guidelines. In an ideal setting, medical, educational, and social milestones are reviewed on a regular basis (eg, annually) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Examples of medical evaluations include ophthalmology, dental, pulmonary function, cardiac, and renal evaluations, as well as screening for stroke risk with transcranial Doppler ultrasound and, in some cases, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for silent cerebral infarcts, with follow-up cognitive testing if needed, or cognitive testing if academic achievement is problematic. Immunization status and educational progress (a marker for cognitive functioning) are also assessed. As with other adolescents, safe-sex practices are discussed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adolescent-sexuality\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adolescent sexuality&quot;</a>), with further consideration of the implications of a partner's sickle cell status (eg, presence of SCD, sickle cell trait, or beta thalassemia), which may have implications for preconception counseling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adolescent-sexuality\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adolescent sexuality&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional information about routine evaluations and treatments is presented in more detail separately.

Resources for these documents are available on several websites. (See <a href=\"#H2121180172\" class=\"local\">'Resources for providers'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2784983597\" class=\"local\">'Resources for patients and families'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Introduce the adult provider. We hold transition clinics where youth and family have a medical visit with their pediatric providers to review the portable medical summary and meet their adult provider. Pediatric and adult teams meet together to review medical, psychologic, education, and social needs of patients in advance of the clinic, and it ends with a formal &quot;graduation&quot; ceremony. However, youth make their first visit with the adult provider while still in the pediatric program.</p><p/><p>Our approach is consistent with a 2011 consensus algorithm on supporting the transition from pediatric to adult care for all youth, created by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Physicians (ACP)-American Society of Internal Medicine, which suggests a series of action steps for different age ranges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115352\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115352 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The TIP-RFT was constructed based on a literature review and a provider and patient consensus. It assesses domains including knowledge and skills in medical self-care, social support, self-efficacy, and independent living and <span class=\"nowrap\">educational/vocational</span> skills. The multidisciplinary team works with the youth to address areas of needed growth prior to transfer to adult care.</p><p>SCD-specific transition planning ideally integrates cognitive assessment as part of the transition program, and parents and providers must assess the youth's ability to make future independent decisions and function autonomously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/34,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,53</a>]. Education milestones related to SCD include both health care knowledge (SCD phenotype, SCD pain plan, preventive measures for SCD complications, current and future primary health care team, medications, allergies, and the most important components of medical history) and health care skills (ability to implement pain plan, ability to take medications as instructed, ability to articulate the most important components of the medical history, informed reproductive decision making, and understanding of health insurance status, including knowledge of specific benefits that are covered and expected out-of-pocket costs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Model transition programs provide youth with tools for tracking appointments and monitoring educational and vocational status including missed days of <span class=\"nowrap\">school/work</span>. Specific coaching in communication and self-advocacy skills to use in the emergency department (ED) is also helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2784983597\"><span class=\"h2\">Resources for patients and families</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of resources available for patients and families to prepare for the transition to adult care. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Workshops</strong> &ndash; Our partner community-based organization (CBO) has offered annual transition workshops that consisted of a mix of didactic and interactive sessions promoting knowledge and skills important for optimal functioning in adult health care (eg, self-advocacy in the ED, understanding of preventive therapies for SCD) as well as in general adult life (eg, sexual health, financial health).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subsequent transition workshops have become more hands-on, with individualized &quot;stations&quot; where youth can meet with their medical and social services providers and a CBO representative and discuss specific challenges they face with insurance, filling prescriptions, and pain management. We have also integrated a focus on families in our transition workshops, including separate sessions with primary caregivers or support persons that allow family members to discuss their own challenges and have their questions answered about how they can best support their youth in transition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Online tools and other electronic communication</strong> &ndash; Internet-based interventions, social media, and other online communication tools are increasingly being used to enhance patient engagement in the health care process, and these can result in improved health outcomes such as reduced hospital readmission rates, enhanced quality of life, and decreased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-care-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

In addition to the youth's development of knowledge and skills, this review emphasized the importance of the pediatric provider taking the time to bring a long-term, close relationship to an end.

The stakes for health and even survival are high for individuals with SCD, who often experience an increase in the use of health care resources as well as a sharp increase in mortality during the young adult years. In addition, certain disease complications become more likely as individuals with SCD grow older. (See <a href=\"#H650953230\" class=\"local\">'Mortality and complications around the time of transition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A successful transition from pediatric to adult SCD care is one in which the youth adheres to therapy, continues along a stable disease trajectory, participates in preventive care and health maintenance, and achieves appropriate developmental milestones. Other indicators of success include good communication, self-efficacy, and trust with the adult provider. (See <a href=\"#H1162199558\" class=\"local\">'Indicators of a successful transition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The success of the transition depends on the patient's self-efficacy, emotional and intellectual readiness, adherence to the care plan, and parental and family support, as well as a patient-centered approach to care. (See <a href=\"#H1496147439\" class=\"local\">'Predictors of success'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A major barrier to the smooth transition from pediatric to adult care in SCD is the limited availability of knowledgeable adult-oriented providers (and hence, limited access to quality health care). Other barriers also exist, including lack of readiness, cognitive dysfunction (eg, due to stroke or silent cerebral infarcts) and depression (eg, due to chronic pain). (See <a href=\"#H569004887\" class=\"local\">'Barriers to success'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease#H439806363\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of stroke (initial or recurrent) in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Silent cerebral infarctions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transition is a multidimensional process that must occur in stages that include providing information about the process, assessing readiness, coordinating communication between pediatric and adult providers, completing age-appropriate medical assessments and interventions, preparing a medical summary and an action plan for pain control and prevention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115352\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115352 \">table 1</a>), and introducing the adult provider. The table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115302 \">table 2</a>) summarizes the six core elements of a healthcare transition; this is consistent with our practice. (See <a href=\"#H712548030\" class=\"local\">'Overview of our practice'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most youth are transitioned to adult care at approximately 21 years of age; however, transition readiness is determined by the individual's social and emotional development and achievement of milestones in disease management, not by a prespecified age. (See <a href=\"#H593371043\" class=\"local\">'Readiness assessment and age of transition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of outstanding online resources are available for patients, families, and providers.
