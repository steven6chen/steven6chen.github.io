The major causes of flank pain and hematuria, such as nephrolithiasis and blood clot, were not present (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below). Renal arteriography suggested focally impaired cortical perfusion, while renal biopsy showed interstitial fibrosis and arterial sclerosis.</p><p>Since the original report, several hundred cases of LPHS have been reported in the medical literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2504772702\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of loin pain-hematuria syndrome (LPHS) is not well understood. Approximately one-half of our more than 200 LPHS patients reside in Central Ohio, which has a population of two million. If our patients represent one-half of those with LPHS in this region, the prevalence of LPHS is about 0.012 percent. This qualifies LPHS as a rare disease (prevalence less than 0.07 percent) according to the Rare Disease Act of 2002 (House Resolution 4013).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loin pain-hematuria syndrome (LPHS) is a poorly defined disorder characterized by recurrent or persistent loin (flank) pain and hematuria that appears to represent glomerular bleeding. Most patients present with both manifestations, but some present with loin pain or hematuria alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Affected patients are typically young (mean age of 31 years in one review, with some cases occurring in teenage children) women (70 to 80 percent in most series), and almost all white [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. As many as 50 percent of patients with LPHS have nephrolithiasis, as defined by either a history of passing stones or, on imaging studies, renal calcifications typical of stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The factors responsible for the predominance in women are not well understood. Women tend to have thinner glomerular basement membranes than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], which may predispose to glomerular hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thin basement membrane nephropathy (benign familial hematuria)&quot;, section on 'Microscopic hematuria'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2035514\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary versus secondary LPHS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LPHS is considered primary when it occurs in the absence of an underlying acquired glomerular disease, and secondary when it occurs with an acquired glomerular disease, most often IgA nephropathy. Among 43 consecutive patients that we saw with LPHS, all had a negative urologic evaluation; 34 had primary LPHS; and 9 had secondary LPHS (associated with IgA nephropathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. We have also encountered two patients with LPHS who had fibrillary glomerulonephritis.</p><p>The diagnostic distinction between primary and secondary LPHS is made by renal biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Renal biopsy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hematuria in LPHS is typically characterized by dysmorphic red cells, primarily acanthocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79440\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79440 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62064 \">picture 2</a>), with or without red blood cell casts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55778\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55778 \">picture 3</a>), both of which indicate a glomerular origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2,3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Glomerular versus nonglomerular bleeding'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults#H1824471569\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Acanthocytes'</a>.) </p><p>However, the absence of acanthocytes and red cell casts does not exclude LPHS. In such patients, intratubular crystal deposition may be primarily responsible for the flank pain and hematuria. An alternative explanation for the absence of acanthocytes is that the glomerular hematuria may be the result of focal glomerular &quot;blow out,&quot; which would permit red cells to enter the renal tubular lumens without being distorted by the glomerular filtration barrier. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Possible role of intratubular crystal formation'</a> below.)</p><p>The hematuria can be microscopic but most patients have experienced at least one episode of gross hematuria (25 of 34 in our series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Episodes of gross hematuria are almost always accompanied by worsening pain. The episodes usually last a few days, but gross hematuria and pain can persist for weeks to months. We have also observed patients with kidney biopsy-documented primary LPHS who had severe gross hematuria, often painless, which lasted for many months. In some of these patients, the gross hematuria was sufficient to produce iron deficiency.</p><p>Between episodes of gross hematuria, the urinalysis typically shows microscopic hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, in some patients, hematuria clears but pain persists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The glomerular filtration rate, as estimated from the serum creatinine concentration, generally remains normal. Protein excretion is typically normal or slightly elevated. Hypertension is not a feature of primary LPHS, although some patients have hypertension for other reasons.</p><p>These general principles were illustrated in a report of 34 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean serum creatinine was 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (80 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension was present in six patients (18 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein excretion was above the upper limit of normal of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in 11 patients (32 percent), but only two had protein excretion above 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (maximum 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Loin pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loin (flank) pain, which may be described as burning or throbbing, is localized at the costovertebral angles and made worse by a gentle punch. As with other causes of renal colic, the pain may radiate to the abdomen, inguinal area, or medial thigh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>At presentation, the pain can be unilateral or, less often, bilateral (6 of 34 in the above series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the majority of patients eventually develop bilateral pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The pain is induced or exacerbated by exercise in approximately one-half of patients and riding in a car can be uncomfortable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The pain is typically severe, leading clinicians to consider or prescribe narcotic therapy. Sleep may be difficult since the supine position increases flank pressure. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients describe upper abdominal pain, but costovertebral angle punch tenderness is also present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, tenderness of the muscles overlying the costovertebral area is common because of chronic muscle spasm.</p><p>The onset of loin pain is often associated with nausea and vomiting, which are common in patients who require hospitalization for pain control. This can complicate management because the patient may be unable to control the loin pain with oral opioids (see <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Opioid therapy'</a> below). In many of these patients, nausea and vomiting are the reasons for hospitalization and can be recurring problems. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Opioid therapy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When renal biopsy is performed in patients with primary LPHS, the glomeruli are normal on light and immunofluorescence microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, there are usually numerous renal tubules that contain red cells or red cell casts, indicating that glomerular bleeding is the source of hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>It is likely that the glomerular hematuria is the result of structural abnormalities in the glomerular basement membrane that are not visible by light or immunofluorescence microscopy. On electron microscopy, approximately 60 percent of biopsy specimens show thin or thick glomerular basement membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We have observed three relatively distinct clinical presentations in patients with LPHS. Scenario 1 is most common and scenario 3 is least common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Scenario 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A young woman presents to her primary care physician with moderate to severe unilateral or bilateral flank pain, and microscopic hematuria is noted. Pyelonephritis is diagnosed, although pyuria and bacteriuria are absent. An antibiotic is administered, but the pain persists. Successive renal imaging studies are normal or negative. An opioid is started with some pain relief.</p><p>The patient is referred to a urologist who repeats the imaging studies and then performs cystoscopy and retrograde examination, all of which are normal. The pain continues. The urologist then places ureteral stents, but the stents do not relieve the pain.</p><p>Symptomatic urinary tract infection ensues. The stents are removed and the infection resolves, but the patient is still miserable. She is then referred to a pain medicine specialist or a nephrologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Scenario 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient presents with unilateral flank pain and hematuria caused by an obstructing kidney stone. The kidney stone is eventually passed or removed, but the pain and hematuria persist. After multiple negative or normal urologic procedures, the patient is referred to a pain medicine specialist or a nephrologist. Narcotic-seeking behavior is suspected.</p><p>A variation of scenario 2 is the patient who has had kidney stones in the past and now has nephrocalcinosis consistent with medullary sponge kidney or the medullary calcifications that can be seen in patients with hypercalciuria (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-sponge-kidney#H21853656\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary sponge kidney&quot;, section on 'Kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrocalcinosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrocalcinosis&quot;, section on 'Hypercalciuria without hypercalcemia'</a>). Imaging studies show no evidence of obstruction to urine flow but the patient has severe pain that is usually bilateral. Narcotic-seeking behavior is suspected. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Scenario 3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A serious athlete experiences flank pain and gross hematuria while playing or practicing his or her sport. The pain is of sufficient severity and the hematuria of sufficient alarm that the patient quits the sport. Numerous urologic procedures are performed, which are all normal or negative. Eventually, the patient is referred to a nephrologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple hypotheses have been proposed for the hematuria and pain associated with the loin pain-hematuria syndrome (LPHS), including vascular disease of the kidney, coagulopathy, renal vasospasm (including microinfarction), and psychopathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There is no objective evidence supporting any of these factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of hematuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When renal biopsy is performed, some patients have a known cause of glomerular hematuria such as IgA nephropathy or vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. Such patients are considered to have <strong>secondary</strong> LPHS, while patients without signs of acquired underlying glomerular disease are considered to have <strong>primary</strong> LPHS. (See <a href=\"#H2035514\" class=\"local\">'Primary versus secondary LPHS'</a> above.)</p><p>Renal biopsy in patients with primary LPHS shows evidence of glomerular hematuria, as manifested by red cells in the tubules. This finding is seen significantly more often in patients with LPHS than in normal kidneys from transplant donors (7.2 versus 1.6 percent of tubular cross-sections with red cells in a blinded assessment in our series of 34 patients), thereby precluding trauma from the biopsy as the cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Renal biopsy also showed red cell casts in the tubules in some patients with LPHS but not in controls, another objective sign of glomerular hematuria. In addition, as mentioned above, approximately 60 percent of biopsy specimens show abnormally thin or thick glomerular basement membranes on electron microscopy, suggesting an important role for glomerular basement membrane abnormalities in the pathogenesis of hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>].</p><p>We consider glomerular hematuria to be present if the renal biopsy shows red cell casts, or if more than 3 percent of tubular cross-sections contain red cells, which is approximately 2 standard deviations above the mean value in normal kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Some patients with the syndrome of LPHS do not have increased numbers of red cells in tubular cross-sections on renal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Possible explanations are that the patients did not have gross hematuria at the time that renal biopsy was performed, which is usually the case, and sampling error. Thus, the absence of glomerular hematuria on renal biopsy should not exclude the diagnosis of primary LPHS. Patients with the clinical syndrome of LPHS but not the requisite kidney biopsy findings are comparable to LPHS patients with the requisite kidney biopsy findings of red cells in tubules or red blood cell casts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Possible role of intratubular crystal formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In as many as 50 percent of patients with primary LPHS (16 of 34 in our series), glomerular hematuria coexists with nephrolithiasis, as manifested by a history of passed stones <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> typical calcifications on imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Similar findings have been described in patients with thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN). In a study of 46 patients with TBMN or first-degree relatives with persistent microscopic hematuria, the 18 patients with risk factors for stone formation (hypercalciuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperuricosuria) had, when compared with patients with normal urine calcium and uric acid excretion, significantly higher rates of episodes of both gross hematuria (44 versus 7 percent) and loin pain (27 versus 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thin basement membrane nephropathy (benign familial hematuria)&quot;, section on 'Gross hematuria and flank pain'</a>.) </p><p>Thus, renal tubular injury and obstruction may be promoted by the simultaneous presence of red cells and microcrystals in the tubular lumen, leading to gross hematuria and loin pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55828\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55828 \">figure 1</a>). Whether intratubular crystal formation can cause LPHS in the absence of glomerular hematuria is not clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of loin pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of loin (flank) pain in patients with LPHS is incompletely understood. The following observations support the hypothesis that the pain of LPHS originates in the kidney:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pain is localized at the costovertebral angles and made worse by a gentle punch, features that are typical of kidney pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LPHS pain can be stopped at least temporarily by denervating the kidney. The efficacy of renal denervation is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Surgical renal denervation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>We suggest the following sequence of events as a contributor to the loin pain in LPHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glomerular hematuria, often in the presence of abnormal (thin or thick) glomerular basement membranes, is the initiating event, leading sequentially to tubular obstruction, backleak of glomerular filtrate, and local parenchymal edema that promotes compression of adjacent tubules. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both tubular obstruction and compression of adjacent tubules lead to glomerular hypertension and further bleeding into the tubules. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The net effect is a vicious cycle that eventually results in diffuse parenchymal edema, stretching of the renal capsule, and loin pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55828\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55828 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p>As mentioned above, hypercalciuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperuricosuria may contribute to tubular obstruction and, in patients with thin basement membrane nephropathy, are associated with significantly higher rates of episodes of loin pain than similar patients with normal urinary calcium and uric acid excretion (27 versus 3 percent in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Possible role of intratubular crystal formation'</a> above.) </p><p>However, the great majority of patients with glomerular bleeding or with urolithiasis (or its risk factors) do not have the severe and constant or frequently recurrent pain of LPHS. Thus, other factors are needed to explain the pathogenesis of pain that occurs in primary or secondary LPHS. As examples, patients with LPHS may have greater compliance of the renal capsule or qualitative or quantitative differences in the innervation of the renal capsule, each of which could enhance the susceptibility to renal pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55828\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55828 \">figure 1</a>). Alternatively, patients with LPHS may have central nervous system amplification of pain as in those with fibromyalgia (and many patients with LPHS also meet criteria for, and are being treated for, fibromyalgia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Possible somatoform pain disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A psychiatric component has been described in patients with LPHS and some have suggested a type of somatoform pain disorder (ie, pain that cannot be explained by a known medical disease) and possible drug-seeking behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p>One report compared 15 patients with LPHS to 10 patients with complicated renal stone disease who were matched for age, sex, and duration of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The patients with LPHS were much more likely to have medically unexplained somatic symptoms, an adverse psychologic event preceding the onset of pain (8 versus 0), and a history of greater analgesic ingestion. The origin of hematuria was not established.</p><p>Some of these patients have been managed successfully with antidepressants, anxiolytics, and supportive counseling, although the hematuria may persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. On the other hand, effective non-narcotic analgesic therapy may potentially lead to cessation of drug use and reversal of any psychiatric disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H166938\" class=\"local\">'Other invasive modalities'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon the evaluation of more than 200 patients referred to our center with unexplained loin (flank) pain and hematuria, we suggest the following step-wise approach. The diagnosis of loin pain-hematuria syndrome (LPHS) requires exclusion of causes of nonglomerular bleeding, fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria for LPHS, and renal biopsy if underlying acquired glomerular disease (eg, IgA nephropathy) is suspected in order to distinguish primary LPHS from secondary LPHS.

Blood clots are rarely seen in the urine of LPHS patients with gross hematuria and their presence is highly suggestive of one of the causes of nonglomerular hematuria. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Exclusion of nonglomerular causes of loin pain and hematuria'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults#H1824471590\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Blood clots'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal biopsy is warranted in patients in whom underlying acquired glomerular disease is suspected.

We believe that LPHS eventually resolves in most patients. This conclusion is based upon our experience that LPHS is unusual in persons older than 60 years of age, and that neither end-stage kidney disease nor premature death is a feature of LPHS.</p><p>A possible explanation for spontaneous resolution is that the glomeruli that bleed eventually become nonfunctional due to tubular damage. If the destroyed nephrons represent only a minority of the nephrons, the LPHS will resolve and the patient will be left with normal or near-normal kidney function. </p><p>With regard to morbidity, approximately 15 percent of our primary LPHS patients eventually develop proteinuria with a 24-hour urine <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/creatinine</span> ratio greater than 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mg</span>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of loin pain-hematuria syndrome (LPHS) is usually the same in primary LPHS (occurs in the absence of an acquired glomerular disease) and secondary LPHS (occurs in the presence of an acquired glomerular disease, most often IgA nephropathy). One exception is secondary LPHS is due to a glomerular disease for which there is specific therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.) </p><p>There have been no randomized trials evaluating the treatment of LPHS. Thus, the following approach is largely based upon our experience in the care of over 200 patients with this disorder. The intensity of therapy varies with the severity of the pain. Patients with severe pain typically require high-dose opioids daily or almost daily, frequently visit the emergency department, and occasionally require hospitalization for intravenous opioid therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">General measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with LPHS generally have normal renal function and renal ultrasonography excludes renal stone disease and other disorders. Patients who fulfill these criteria should be reassured that their kidneys are functioning well and should continue to do so. The patients should also be advised to avoid activities that induce LPHS pain, such as exercise in approximately one-half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Loin pain'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Angiotensin inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited evidence suggests that administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) may reduce both the frequency and severity of episodes of gross hematuria and loin pain. In a report of seven patients with LPHS who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> for 7 to 48 months, four reported fewer or less severe episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A possible mechanism for such a benefit is that efferent arteriolar dilation induced by decreased angiotensin II activity reduces intraglomerular pressure and therefore the likelihood of glomerular rupture and hematuria. The reduction in intraglomerular pressure is less prominent or not seen with other classes of antihypertensive drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Effect of antihypertensive drugs on proteinuria'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduce the risk of nephrolithiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, as many as one-half of patients with LPHS have nephrolithiasis, as defined by either a history of passing stones or renal calcifications typical of stones on imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Possible role of intratubular crystal formation'</a> above.)</p><p>It is possible that renal tubular injury and obstruction is promoted by the simultaneous presence of red cells and microcrystals in the tubular lumen, leading to gross hematuria and loin pain. We have observed calcium oxalate microcrystals obstructing distal nephrons in the kidney biopsy from several patients with LPHS even though there was no history of nephrolithiasis.</p><p>Based upon these observations, we recommend a 24-hour urine collection for calcium, uric acid, oxalate, citrate, sodium, and creatinine (to estimate the completeness of the urine collection) in patients with LPHS, including those who have no history of stone disease. If an abnormality is found in patients with significant LPHS symptoms, a trial of corrective therapy (eg, increased fluid intake, low-salt diet for hypercalciuria, potassium citrate for hypocitraturia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> or reduced meat intake for hyperuricosuria) is reasonable to see if the frequency or severity of gross hematuria and pain is reduced. There are no confirmatory data supporting benefit from this approach.

Every effort should be made to <strong>avoid</strong> opioid therapy. If opioids are necessary, particularly for daily therapy, consultation with a pain specialist is recommended. The general approach to the treatment of chronic pain and issues related to prescription drug misuse are discussed in detail elsewhere.

The following regimen is based upon <strong>our experience</strong> in the treatment of over 200 patients with LPHS. </p><p>For patients with LPHS pain exacerbations that do not respond to nonopioid therapy, we typically prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> (5 mg of <span class=\"nowrap\">hydrocodone/500</span> mg of acetaminophen [Vicodin]) one or two tablets every four hours as needed. To avoid acetaminophen toxicity, this regimen should be temporary and should not exceed six tablets per day (3 g of acetaminophen per day, which is well under the intake of more than 4 g of acetaminophen per day that is usually associated with toxicity). Patients on opioid analgesics should be strongly discouraged from using other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol or benzodiazepines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-pathophysiology-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning in adults: Pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Preferred opioids for treatment of moderate to severe pain are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> (5 to 10 mg every four hours as needed) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> (4 mg every four hours as needed).

Acutely managing pain with intravenous opioids and antiemetics in the emergency department seldom provides sufficient relief of pain and nausea. As a result, hospitalization is required for pain control and the Pain Service should be consulted. </p><p>In our experience, three to five days of intravenous opioids is usually sufficient to break the pain cycle. We also allow an additional hospital day to transition from the intravenous opioid regimen to the patient's usual outpatient opioid regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9936607\"><span class=\"h5\">Intravenous opioid regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical intravenous regimen involves opioid administration using a patient-controlled analgesia pump. If the 24-hour total dose required to control the patient's pain is known, then about 50 percent of the opioid hourly dose is given as a constant infusion. As an example, a patient who requires 48 mg of IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> over 24 hours can be given 1 mg per hour (24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> as a continuous infusion.

Such patients may be candidates for an implantable drug delivery system (IDDS) that permits intrathecal administration of opioid, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The advantage of intrathecal administration is the ability to get the opioid directly to the opioid receptors in the spinal cord, thereby reducing the systemic concentration and minimizing systemic side effects. Intrathecally delivered morphine is about 300 times more powerful than oral morphine.</p><p>Of the invasive therapies we have used in patients with LPHS, the IDDS has been the most effective. Among more than 20 treated patients, pain was largely controlled and hospitalization and emergency department visits were substantially reduced (unpublished personal observation). Our longest treated patient has been receiving intrathecal therapy for more than 20 years. Some patients treated with IDDS need occasional oral opioids for episodes of breakthrough pain. </p><p>Limitations to the IDDS include high cost and the risk of developing intrathecal catheter-tip inflammatory masses due to mast cell granulomas that are induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. These masses can act as space-occupying lesions and produce neurologic symptoms. In our experience, switching from morphine to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> appears to prevent progression of the granulomas. Limited data suggest that cessation of opioid therapy through the catheter is associated with shrinkage or resolution of the mass over two to five months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loin-pain-hematuria-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Although rare, infection can occur with IDDS use; this is more frequent in diabetic patients, and therefore diabetes is a possible contraindication to use IDDS.

LPHS is considered primary when it occurs in the absence of an underlying acquired glomerular disease, and secondary when it occurs with an acquired glomerular disease (eg, IgA nephropathy). LPHS is considered to be primary if the hematuria is the result of a constitutive condition (eg, abnormally thin or thick GBM). (See <a href=\"#H2504772702\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several common clinical presentations of LPHS, but they all include the following clinical features characteristic of LPHS (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentations'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recurrent or persistent loin (flank) pain &minus; The pain, which may be described as burning or throbbing, is localized at the costovertebral angles, and is associated with costovertebral angle tenderness. The pain can be unilateral or, less often, bilateral, and is often induced or exacerbated by exercise and riding in a car. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Loin pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hematuria &minus; The hematuria is usually microscopic and is characterized by dysmorphic red cells indicating a glomerular origin. Most patients experience at least one episode of gross hematuria, which is almost always accompanied by worsening pain. Between episodes of gross hematuria, the urinalysis ordinarily shows microscopic hematuria. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Hematuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The glomerular filtration rate, remains normal or near normal in patients with LPHS, and the incidence of hypertension is not increased compared with the general population. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Renal function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal biopsy in patients with primary LPHS reveals normal glomeruli by light and immunofluorescence microscopy; red cells or red cell casts are present in the tubules, suggesting that glomerular bleeding is the source of hematuria. By electron microscopy, thin or thick glomerular basement membranes are noted in approximately 60 percent of specimens. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Renal biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanisms for hematuria and pain in patients with LPHS are not known. The hematuria in primary LPHS may be due to functionally abnormal glomerular basement membranes, in which temporary gaps form that permit the passage of red blood cells into the urinary space. Glomerular hematuria may be the initiating event in the development of loin pain by causing tubular obstruction leading to backleak of glomerular filtrate, parenchymal edema, and stretching of the renal capsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55828\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55828 \">figure 1</a>). The common occurrence of nephrolithiasis or risk factors for nephrolithiasis in patients with LPHS suggests that intratubular crystals may play a role in the bleeding and pain. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To make a diagnosis of LPHS, the following criteria should be met (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hematuria, defined as more than five red cells per high power field, should be present in almost all urinalyses. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recurrent or persistent pain (present for six months or more), should be severe, localized in the costovertebral angles, and be associated with costovertebral angle tenderness. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonglomerular bleeding, for example nephrolithiasis, urinary infection, polycystic kidney disease, and tumors, must be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Exclusion of nonglomerular causes of loin pain and hematuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obstruction of the urinary tract should not be present, and should be confirmed by at least two imaging procedures during episodes of pain. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal biopsy is warranted in patients in whom underlying acquired glomerular disease (eg, IgA nephropathy) is suspected. Patients with underlying acquired glomerular disease often have overt proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an elevation in serum creatinine, neither of which is likely in primary LPHS. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Renal biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LPHS is unusual in persons older than 60 years of age and is not associated with end-stage kidney disease or premature death. Thus, we believe that LPHS eventually resolves in most patients. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of substantial data, our treatment recommendations are experiential:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Angiotensin inhibition with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may reduce the frequency and severity of hematuria and pain episodes. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Angiotensin inhibition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Given the associations with nephrolithiasis, patients with LPHS should undergo a metabolic stone workup to evaluate risk factors for kidney stones. Abnormalities that are uncovered should be treated appropriately; if none are revealed, then empiric therapy should be attempted to see if the frequency of symptoms can be reduced. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Reduce the risk of nephrolithiasis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-established-nephrolithiasis-and-treatment-if-stone-composition-is-unknown\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult patient with established nephrolithiasis and treatment if stone composition is unknown&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic and acute pain control, similar to that provided to patients with other chronic pain syndromes, should be provided. Nonopioid therapy should be attempted first. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Opioid therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of invasive and experimental therapies have been used in the treatment of severe pain in patients with LPHS. We do not typically recommend these procedures.
