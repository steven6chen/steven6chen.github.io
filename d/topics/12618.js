CKD is now the accepted term in the pediatric nephrology community, replacing the clinical terms chronic renal failure (CRF) and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), which describe kidney dysfunction of varying degrees from severe to mild in nature. CKD more clearly defines kidney dysfunction as a continuum, rather than a discrete change in kidney function, and will be used throughout this topic review.</p><p>An overview of the management of CKD in children will be reviewed here. The etiology, epidemiology, natural course, presentation, and evaluation of CKD in children are discussed separately.

Children with stages G1 and G2 disease are asymptomatic and should be closely followed for deterioration of kidney function. This period should also be used to educate the child and family about CKD, highlighting awareness of risk factors that can aggravate kidney failure (eg, nephrotoxic drugs, recurrent infections, dehydration, obesity, and smoking in adolescents) and of measures that may slow the progression of kidney failure (eg, blood pressure control and reducing proteinuria). </p><p>CKD-associated complications begin to appear as CKD progresses into stage G3a and G3b. These include disorders of fluid and electrolytes, anemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, endocrine abnormalities, growth impairment, mineral and bone disorder (MBD), and disorders due to the decreased clearance of substances normally excreted from the body by the kidney (uremia). In these patients, management is focused on preventing and treating these complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of chronic kidney disease in children&quot;, section on 'Complications of CKD'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who will require renal replacement therapy (RRT) should be identified well in advance of the time that RRT is required so that adequate preparation and education can be provided to both the patient and family. This generally occurs in patients with stage G4 CKD. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Renal replacement therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The following discussion will review the management of pediatric CKD and is consistent with recommendations in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline and the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults#H914954238\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Causes of prerenal disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The normal response to kidney hypoperfusion is to lower the urine sodium concentration and the fractional excretion of sodium. However, the superimposition of a prerenal process among patients with CKD may not result in the expected lowering of urinary sodium because the renal tubular sodium reabsorption is impaired. As a result, patients with CKD who are unable to normally reabsorb sodium are less able to respond to conditions associated with fluid loss or hypotension leading to an increased risk of reduced kidney perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). These patients should be identified at the onset of an intercurrent illness associated with hypovolemia or hypotension so that fluid repletion can be initiated prior to a significant decrease in kidney blood flow. If significant hypovolemia accompanied by a reduction of GFR occurs, a judicious trial of fluid repletion may result in the return of kidney function to the previous baseline. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-kidney-injury-in-children-clinical-features-etiology-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute kidney injury in children: Clinical features, etiology, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of nephrotoxic drugs &ndash; Common nephrotoxic drugs include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, diagnostic agents (eg, radiographic contrast materials), and others (eg, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tacrolimus</a>). The administration of such drugs, therefore, should be avoided or used with caution in patients with underlying CKD, with the assistance of therapeutic drug level monitoring. When drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index are used and precision in dosing is critical (eg, cisplatinum in bone marrow transplant induction protocol) based on renal function, measurement of GFR should be made using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iohexol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">iohexol</a> or one of the radioisotopes (<sup>51</sup>Cr-EDTA, <sup>125</sup>Iothalamate, or <sup>99</sup>Tc-DTPA). In this situation, drug dosing ideally should not be based on an estimated GFR using a regression equation.

This was illustrated in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) cohort, that showed progression of CKD to the composite event of renal replacement therapy (RRT) or 50 percent decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was associated with proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated blood pressure. In children with nonglomerular disease, additional risk factors of dyslipidemia, male sex, and anemia were also identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood pressure control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults and children with CKD, strict blood pressure control has been shown to slow the progression of kidney disease and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In particular, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been suggested as antihypertensive therapy to reduce proteinuria and control blood pressure in these patients.

We agree with the 2017 AAP Clinical Practice Guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents recommends that an ACE inhibitor or ARB is preferred to treat children with CKD who have hypertension and proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There is good evidence that suggest these agents are more protective than other antihypertensive drugs in slowing progression of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>].

In general, a combination of dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy may correct the increased water balance and prevent water retention from recurring.

This amount is substantially lower than the average current intake of a normal, healthy child in the United States.</p><p>In our practice, we work with the child and family to decrease the sodium intake to 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. This is often a difficult task given the sodium content of the current favorite foods of children. Diuretic therapy includes either loop diuretics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a> given at a dose of 0.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day or thiazide diuretics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> at 1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. At our center, we typically use a thiazide diuretic in the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a loop diuretic in the more advanced stages of disease when the thiazides are less effective. Both classes of diuretics become less effective with decreasing GFR.</p><p>Some children with obstructive uropathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysplastic kidneys have poor urinary concentrating capacity and exhibit urinary sodium wasting, resulting in a propensity for hypovolemia and hyponatremia. One must be aware that these children may continue to have substantial urine output, despite fluid losses that occur during episodes of vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea, and require ongoing and close monitoring of fluid and sodium replacement. Small children and infants who are unable to independently access or indicate the need for fluids are totally dependent upon caretakers for fluid replacement. The need for fluid replacement should be emphasized to the caretakers, especially when the child has an intercurrent illness that increases volume losses (eg, diarrhea) or decreases fluid intake (eg, vomiting).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperkalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperkalemia develops primarily because of inadequate potassium excretion due to a reduced GFR.
