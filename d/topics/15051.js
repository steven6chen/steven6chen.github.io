It varies widely in severity, from a minor nuisance in some women to severe, disruptive symptoms in others. Symptoms tend to peak during the third trimester and remit or markedly improve after delivery.</p><p>RLS commonly impacts sleep during pregnancy, and accumulating data indicate that RLS symptoms are associated with increased rates of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, poor sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, poor daytime function, and depressed mood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/1-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-12</a>]. Less robust data suggest that RLS or a history of leg jerking during pregnancy are associated with fetal distress, lower birth weight, prematurity, and obstructive sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,14</a>].</p><p>This topic will review aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of RLS that are unique to pregnancy.

The need to move is usually, but not always, accompanied by other uncomfortable sensations in the legs. Terms that individuals use to describe RLS include &quot;have to move,&quot; &quot;need to move,&quot; &quot;can't get comfortable,&quot; &quot;creepy-crawly,&quot; &quot;aching,&quot; &quot;bug-like,&quot; &quot;itching,&quot; and &quot;antsy,&quot; typically localizing to the lower extremities but also sometimes to the upper extremities. Symptoms usually worsen in the evening or at night, and commonly interfere with quiet activities and sleep.

In large cohort studies, the proportion of women reporting severe to very severe symptoms on a standardized RLS rating scale ranges from 14 to 54 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/1,16,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,30</a>].

Approximately 70 percent of affected women experience complete resolution shortly after delivery, and most others experience clear-cut improvement.</p><p>Although the short-term remission rate for pregnancy-onset cases appears to exceed 90 percent, women who have had the transient form of RLS during pregnancy have a fourfold risk for developing nonpregnancy RLS later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H968296108\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RLS often co-occurs with depression and anxiety in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/36-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-42</a>]. In a large population-based study in the general population, RLS was associated with a significantly increased risk for major depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR] 5) and panic disorder (OR 13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The diagnosis is made by history and does not require additional testing, except for an assessment of iron status (even among women who are not anemic) to determine whether iron replacement is indicated. Polysomnography is not required for the diagnosis.</p><p>Diagnostic criteria for RLS demonstrate the essential clinical features of RLS, all of which are required for the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86837\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86837 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Often, the simple prompt &quot;Do your legs bother you when you are sitting or lying down?&quot; will initiate a focused dialogue that allows the clinician to assess each of the essential criteria and exclude mimics of RLS during pregnancy, such as nocturnal leg cramps. (See <a href=\"#H111903063\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The severity of symptoms and their impact on functioning should be documented. The clinical significance of RLS is particularly important to identify because it guides the need for therapies beyond reassurance and possible nonpharmacologic interventions. A 10-question RLS severity scale can be useful clinically and is available <a href=\"http://irlssg.org/&amp;token=WlLOYo+1ZcNUfqyUN32c0OFfmUCEU5nWKuUx79WYl6I=&amp;TOPIC_ID=98366\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">online</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111903063\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of common and uncommon conditions can mimic restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy.
