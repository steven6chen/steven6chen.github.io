The early clips were cumbersome and difficult to use, complicated by frequent misfire rates and technical difficulties in positioning the clip during endoscopy. However, their use spread rapidly through Japan initially and then in Europe. More recently endoscopic clipping technology has also gained greater acceptance in the United States.</p><p>Endoscopic clips are used widely not only for the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding but also for a variety of other gastrointestinal problems. In this review, we will describe the various clips currently available along with basic principles of clip application. The practical aspects of particular applications and the evidence supporting their role will also be presented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AVAILABLE CLIPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most recent iterations of endoclips are a marked improvement over earlier models. They are available in multiple sizes and some can be rotated or reopened while being deployed through the endoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Four companies produce disposable endoclips for use in the United States market.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Olympus USA, Corp. produces the QuickClip2, which is a rotatable clip device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52806\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52806 \">picture 1</a>). These devices are produced in two sizes, 8 mm or 12 mm in width when opened and 165 cm to 230 cm in length, allowing deployment through a colonoscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Boston Scientific, Inc. produces the Resolution Clip, which cannot be rotated but can be reopened after closure if repositioning is required (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67534\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67534 \">picture 2</a>). The Resolution Clip has an opening width of 11 mm and is available in lengths of 165 cm and 235 cm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cook Medical produces the TriClip, a three-pronged endoclip whose efficacy has not yet been as rigorously evaluated as the traditionally shaped clipping devices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68200\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68200 \">picture 3</a>). The TriClip opens to a width of 12 mm and is 205 cm long. Preliminary experience has not detected obvious advantages of this configuration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another clip from Cook Medical is the Instinct Endoscopic Hemoclip. It opens to a width of 16 mm and allows for 360 degree bidirectional rotation. In addition, the jaws can be reopened to reposition the clip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F91689\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91689 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovesco Endoscopy AG manufactures a large over-the-scope clip device that deploys similarly to band ligation. It is used for hemostasis or to close mucosal defects. Opposing sides of tissue are suctioned <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> grabbed via special accessories and pulled into a cap-like cylinder attached to the tip of the endoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F91499\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91499 \">picture 5</a>). </p><p/><p>All clips apart from the over-the-scope clip fit through the standard 2.8 mm biopsy channel of an endoscope or colonoscope, so they can be used with both &quot;diagnostic&quot; and &quot;therapeutic&quot; (large-channel) endoscopes. There are no endoclips that are long enough to be deployed through a standard push enteroscope longer than 180 cm. The specifications of clip devices commercially available in North America are summarized in table 1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57403\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57403 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Reusable clip deployment devices from Olympus are still available but used infrequently in the United States mainly because they are difficult to clean and sterilize. In Europe the reusable deployment devices (EZ Clip) are used more commonly; they are available in six different models and sizes of hemoclips.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF HEMOSTASIS, TISSUE APPOSITION, AND RETENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoclips are steel, mechanical devices that cause hemostasis by grasping vessels or surrounding tissue. Although they cause tissue compression, they do not cause inflammation or acute tissue injury such as occurs with sclerosants or thermal coagulation.</p><p>Control of bleeding is generally successful when Endoclips are used for bleeding acute ulcers, or lesions such as Mallory-Weiss tears. By contrast, control of bleeding is less successful for lesions that are fibrotic (such as chronic ulcers), especially when using smaller endoclips or those that cannot be rotated. A failure rate as high as 20 percent has been described with chronic ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Apposition of the sides of lesions such as ulcers, tears, or acute perforations is a fundamental surgical principle for tissue repair and healing that is often possible with endoscopic clips. Repair and healing are possible if the endoclip can be placed across the lesion into soft, normal-appearing tissue. There is some evidence that ulcer healing is accelerated when the sides are apposed and that ulcers heal more rapidly with endoclips compared with thermally-treated ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Retention rates (the duration that endoclips remain in position until sloughing into the lumen) on ulcers vary remarkably. Studies in a porcine model suggest that the Resolution device may remain attached for a longer duration (four to five weeks) than the other commercially available devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], but this observation has not been confirmed in humans. To be successful, endoclips must remain in place at least until collagen deposition occurs, which may take several weeks. Longer, rotatable, grasp and release hemoclips or clips with interlocking jaws appear to be the most promising for these indications. TriClip models have the lowest retention rate on acute or chronic ulcers (&lt;25 percent at one week), whereas the other hemoclips have &gt;50 percent retention after one week and may actually stay on longer than ulcer healing time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF APPLICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specifics of deploying the different brands of endoclips are different for each type. However, the general principles for effective deployment remain the same and many of the basic techniques are used for deployment regardless of the lesion being treated. Endoscopists and assistants should be trained in the specifics of several models.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For Olympus QuickClip models, the handle of the endoclip device is partially closed until the jaws are opened to their maximal opening. The endoclip is then pressed into the soft tissue and the handle of the clip device is fully closed, deploying the clip into the tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Boston Scientific Resolution clips are deployed in a similar method, although the jaws can be reopened after closing them on the lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Cook TriClip deployment involves closing the handle to the desired force of clip grasp and then releasing the clip by opening the handle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Cook Instinct Clip is fully rotational and also allows for the jaws to be opened and closed to reposition the clip prior to fully closing to deploy.</p><p/><p>Effective intervention requires good visualization of the lesion, whether it is an ulcer, a tear, or a perforation. Once the lesion is identified, the endoscope is stabilized with the target lesion in view. The endoclip is then passed through the suction channel of the endoscope and extended into the field of view. The endoclip is primed for firing and maneuvered into position. Some endoclip models can be rotated to improve positioning. Once the endoclip is positioned adequately, it is extended so that the jaws are across the target of interest and pressed into the adjacent tissue. The endoclip is then fired, causing the jaws to close and tightly appose the tissue. The Boston Scientific and Cook Medical Instinct Endoscopic Hemoclip jaws close on the target before deployment of the hemoclip. As a result, the jaws on these clips can be reopened and repositioned before deployment. Several endoclips may be required for complete intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H235552770\"><span class=\"h1\">USES FOR THROUGH-THE-SCOPE ENDOCLIPS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding peptic ulcers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before hemoclips, the mainstay of hemostasis was injection therapy or various thermal coagulation methods. More recently, at least nine randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of endoclips used alone or in combination with other methods. The majority used the standard sized Olympus endoclips (8 mm open) and were conducted outside of the United States. The comparator groups differed among the trials, trial quality was variable, and in many the sample size may have been too small to detect important differences.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the data considered together suggest that Olympus hemoclips have similar efficacy as thermal coagulation methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There are no randomized studies of newer hemoclips for emergency hemostasis, or comparisons of different types of hemoclips. Also, there are no comparisons of different sizes of hemoclips. More randomized studies by experienced and trained endoscopists will be needed to study the newer hemoclips, the grasp and release improvement, and whether larger size makes a difference for emergency hemostasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following summarizes the range of findings in the controlled trials. Two compared endoclips to thermal coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>], five to injection monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>], and two to combination therapy with injection and coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies comparing the endoclip to the heater probe have shown mixed results for initial control of bleeding and rebleeding rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. One report of 113 with major stigmata of ulcer hemorrhage found no difference in hemostasis, 30-day mortality, or need for emergency surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients randomized to the endoclip group had significantly lower rebleeding rates (2 versus 21 percent). However, only 60 percent of active bleeders were successfully treated with the heater probe, a rate much lower than in previous reports.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study of 80 patients found a higher rate of control of initial bleeding with the heater probe compared with the Olympus endoclip (100 versus 85 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Rebleeding rates were not significantly different.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rebleeding rates were significantly lower with the endoclip compared with distilled water injections (10 versus 28 percent) in high-risk bleeding ulcers in a single study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, recurrent bleeding was decreased with endoclips compared with hypertonic saline-epinephrine injection (2 versus 15 percent) while combination therapy was no more effective than endoclip alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. By contrast, treatment failure was significantly higher in the endoclip group compared with epinephrine-polidocanol injection therapy (34 versus 6 percent) or a combination therapy arm (25 percent) in another study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No significant differences in procedure duration, initial hemostasis, or rebleeding rates in a study of 47 patients comparing combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection plus monopolar electrocoagulation versus hemoclips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As a potential confounding issue, more than 22 percent of the hemoclip patients were pretreated with epinephrine.</p><p/><p>Few studies have compared the various clips to one another. One such study, comparing the Hemoclip to the TriClip in patients with high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers, found superior hemostasis with the Hemoclip, particularly in sites that were difficult to approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Special situations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are some clinical settings in which endoclips may be preferred to other hemostatic methods:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They may be particularly useful in the treatment of ulcers in patients who are coagulopathic or require ongoing anticoagulation. In such patients, electrocoagulation will increase the size, depth, and healing time of treated lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoclips may have an advantage in the retreatment of lesions that rebleed after initial thermal hemostasis. Animal studies support reduced injury after ulcer hemostasis with hemoclips versus thermal coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similarly, animal data suggest that healing may be accelerated with endoclips compared with thermal methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visualization of the target bleeding site is a prerequisite for accurate deployment. Ulcers on the lesser curvature, the posterior duodenum, or the cardia increase the difficulty of deployment and clip failure rates.</p><p>For acute ulcers, the endoclip should be placed so that the jaws extend beyond the ulcer edge and are embedded into the surrounding soft tissue. Multiple endoclips may be required to close the walls of the lesion and achieve initial hemostasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63669\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63669 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p>For chronic, fibrotic, or large ulcers, the endoclip should be placed on the major stigmata of hemorrhage, which is usually in the base of the lesion. Whether to use clips as a single modality therapy for active bleeding and visible vessels or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection therapy warrants further study.</p><p>Common errors to avoid:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deployment with clip tip too far away from the endoscope tip, leading to lack of control and precision</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bumping of partly open clip against bowel lumen wall to displace previously placed clips (QuickClip2 or TriClip)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premature closure of the clip due to improper manipulation of the handle by the assistant (QuickClip2 or TriClip)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient clips available to complete hemostasis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Mallory-Weiss tears</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoclips have theoretical advantages compared to other hemostatic techniques in actively-bleeding Mallory-Weiss tears, although they have not been extensively compared. They do not cause significant tissue damage, permit rapid tissue apposition, and have a low risk of perforation.</p><p>A few reports have described experience with endoclips with Mallory-Weiss tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Hemostasis was successful in all patients in a study of 26 patients with active bleeding or an adherent clot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In another study, Olympus endoclips were compared to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection for hemostasis of an actively bleeding Mallory-Weiss tear in 35 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There was no difference in rebleeding rates between the two groups. There have been no studies conducted comparing the efficacy of endoclips with electrocoagulation or combination therapy for the treatment of Mallory-Weiss tears. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mallory-weiss-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mallory-Weiss syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The application of endoclips in Mallory-Weiss tears is similar to treatment of acute ulcers or acute postpolypectomy bleeding (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Postpolypectomy bleeding'</a> below). Endoclips should be extended so that the opened jaws are perpendicular to the long axis of the tear and applied to close the sides of the tear and stop the active bleeding. Multiple endoclips may be required if the Mallory-Weiss tear is long or wide.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Dieulafoy's lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Dieulafoy's lesion is defined as active arterial bleeding or an adherent clot on an underlying vessel in the absence of an ulcer. At least two controlled trials suggested that endoclips can control acute bleeding and may reduce recurrent bleeding compared with injection therapy but there are no studies comparing it with thermal coagulation used alone or in combination with other methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Lesions in these studies were predominantly in the stomach and duodenum. Thermal coagulation has been considered the treatment of choice for hemostasis of bleeding Dieulafoy's lesions despite rebleeding rates as high as 50 percent. Other endoscopic methods have also been described. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report found that endoscopic mechanical hemostasis was more effective for hemostasis of bleeding Dieulafoy's lesions than injection therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although the study included band ligation in three patients in the mechanical hemostasis arm, the majority underwent endoclip therapy. Mechanical hemostasis was more effective in initial hemostasis (92 versus 75 percent), recurrent bleeding (8 versus 33 percent), and emergency surgery (0 versus 17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second trial comparing endoclips to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection found similar rates of initial hemostasis but dramatically lower rates of rebleeding in the endoclip arm (0 versus 35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For bleeding Dieulafoy's lesions, the bleeding artery must be identified precisely so that the endoclip can be accurately placed on the bleeding point. If the orientation of the bleeding vessel can be identified, the jaws of the endoclip should be placed perpendicularly across the vessel. It is important to grasp enough soft tissue around the bleeding vessel to mechanically compress it.</p><p>The TriClip is well suited to perpendicular deployment, although the longer Resolution Clip may allow for more tamponade with soft tissue and longer retention rates. There are no randomized comparisons of different hemoclips for bleeding Dieulafoy's lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Diverticular bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only case series have described experience with endoclips in diverticular bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. These have suggested that they may provide as effective hemostasis as thermal coagulation, but there is decreased perforation risk, particularly for lesions at the base of the diverticulum where the wall is thin. An additional benefit of endoclip application, is the potential to serve as a marker if rebleeding occurs and repeat colonoscopy, angiography, or surgery is required. However, other methods (such as tattooing) may be more reliable if permanent marking is desired. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tattooing and other methods for localizing colonic lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the reports described the application of endoclips either directly to bleeding vessels within the diverticula or across the mouth of the diverticulum to pinch it closed. Endoclips placed at the base of the diverticulum may pose less of a risk of perforation compared with thermal coagulation therapy.</p><p>There are settings in which the bleeding point or stigmata cannot be clipped directly or where the stigmata is at the mouth or neck of the diverticulum. In such cases, the diverticulum can be closed with endoclips. There are several methods to accomplish this. As a general rule, the jaws of the endoclip should be able to traverse the width of the diverticulum. However, if the diverticulum is large, longer endoclips may be used or endoclips may be initially applied in a sequential fashion from one side of the diverticulum, gradually &quot;zipping&quot; the mouth closed. Several endoclips, in order to close the diverticulum effectively, are usually required. Injection of dilute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (eg, 1:20,000 in normal saline) prior to the application of an endoclip may assist with hemostasis and by everting the base of the diverticulum, thereby making stigmata more accessible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60007\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60007 \">picture 7</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Postpolypectomy bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoclips have been used for postpolypectomy bleeding and to prevent postpolypectomy bleeding in high-risk settings. However, there have been few studies.</p><p>Endoclips were effective in controlling immediate postpolypectomy bleeding in most patients in two series with a total of 119 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Despite these excellent results, there are no comparative studies of clipping versus thermal modalities. Prophylactic use of endoclips for prevention of bleeding has also been proposed but its efficacy is unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic removal of large colon polyps&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Delayed postpolypectomy bleeding is usually caused by ulceration at the site of the polypectomy. These bleeding lesions can be treated similar to ulcers as described in the previous sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In acute postpolypectomy bleeds, there are several possible approaches to the effective application of an endoclip. When the bleeding is from the stump of a pedunculated polyp, the endoclip is usually most effective when placed across the stalk base. This ligates the feeding vessels responsible for the bleeding. For bleeding from sessile polyps that were resected via piecemeal or saline-assisted polypectomy, the endoclip is applied directly to the bleeding site first. After control of hemorrhage, endoclips can be used to close the mucosal defect, if it is large or oozing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75449\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75449 \">picture 8</a>). </p><p>Three trials have shown that clip closure reduces the rates of delayed bleeding after endoscopic mucosal resection of large polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Without clips, bleeding rates ranged from 3.9 to 9.7 percent, whereas with clipping the bleeding rate was 1.1 to 1.8 percent. However, an earlier study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] failed to demonstrate a benefit. While awaiting the results of large prospective randomized controlled trials, it is our practice to consider using clips for closure following removal of large sessile polyps when feasible, particularly in patients who need to resume anticoagulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Perforations and fistulas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoclips have been used successfully in patients with gastrointestinal perforations from various causes. Case reports include treatment of perforations from fish bone ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], Boerhaave's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], endoscopic mucosal resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>], biliary sphincterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], duodenal polypectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], and colonoscopies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77061\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77061 \">picture 9</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Endoclips have also been used to manage postoperative leaks and fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perforations should be closed as quickly as possible to prevent contamination. The first clip is usually deployed at one end of the perforation, with subsequent clips applied sequentially across the mucosal defect. Multiple endoclips are usually required if single through the scope clips are employed.</p><p>Although endoclips may have a role in the closure of acute perforations, surgery is still the mainstay of clinically significant perforations that are chronic or complicated by contamination or infection. Surgical intervention should be considered strongly if the perforation cannot be closed quickly. Management of such patients is often best done in coordination with a consulting surgeon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Miscellaneous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoclips have been used creatively in a variety of other situations that are not yet widely accepted or attempted. Case reports have described the use of endoclips to secure jejunal feeding tubes and other stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. They may also have a role as a marker to permit identification of a lesion as described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91474252\"><span class=\"h1\">USES FOR OVER-THE-SCOPE ENDOCLIPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over-the-scope clips have generally been used in the setting of recurrent or refractory bleeding that cannot be controlled using through-the-scope endoclips (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F91499\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91499 \">picture 5</a>) or to close of fistulas, anastomotic leaks, and acute perforations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. However, one study reported excellent use as initial therapy in 27 non-variceal bleeders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>The use of over-the-scope clips can be limited by difficulty in obtaining a good en-face view of the target lesion. In addition, in our experience, successful closure of chronic fistulas or anastomotic leaks is often more difficult than closure of an acute perforation and often requires multiple treatment modalities.</p><p>While over-the-scope clips cost considerably more than standard through-the-scope metal clips, cost comparisons need to include efficacy of treatment and the frequent requirement of using multiple standard clips to close a mucosal defect. While the over-the-scope clips have not yet been compared directly with through-the-scope clips for the closure of acute perforations, in a prospective study of 36 perforations in various parts of the gastrointestinal tract, over-the-scope clip placement successfully closed the defect in 29 of 33 cases attempted with a mean of 1.06 clips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. By contrast, a retrospective review looking at the use of through-the-scope clips to close colonic perforations reported a mean of 7.5 clips per closure to achieve similar levels of technical success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. When a single metal clip will suffice such as in a post polypectomy bleed of a clearly visualized stalk, the standard clip will likely be the cost-effective modality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p>Endoscopic clips are a mechanical clamping method that has many potential therapeutic applications.
