Initial reports that were based upon first-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays documented a prevalence of HCV antibodies as high as 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Subsequent studies that used more accurate tests like recombinant immunoblot assays (RIBA-I, RIBA-II) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) found a lower prevalence (14 to 36 percent), but still substantially increased compared to the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. The prevalence of HCV among patients hospitalized with alcohol-related disorders is also increased (15 percent in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a study of US veterans with hepatitis C, 44 percent had a history of alcohol abuse or dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The reason for the higher incidence of HCV infection among alcoholics is incompletely understood. An increased prevalence of high-risk behaviors (such as intravenous drug abuse) among alcoholic patients has been observed in some reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>], although others have not detected this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Most of the studies did not address other potential risk factors, such as cocaine snorting, tattoos, body piercing, and a history of sexually transmitted diseases. Understanding of hepatitis C epidemiology remains elusive and there is a need to improve the tools used to measure practices that can be associated with HCV transmission and are not usually volunteered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF ALCOHOL ON THE NATURAL HISTORY OF HEPATITIS C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have focused on identifying how alcohol affects the natural history of HCV and liver disease.

An illustrative study included 2235 patients with chronic hepatitis C in whom three independent factors were associated with increased rate of fibrosis progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age at infection (older than 40 years)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male gender</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily alcohol consumption of 50 g or more</p><p/><p>Daily alcohol consumption of 50 g or greater was associated with a 34 percent increase in the rate of fibrosis progression, which was defined as the ratio between the histological fibrosis stage (five-point scale: 0 = no fibrosis to 4 = cirrhosis) and the estimated duration of infection in years. Other potential risk factors, such as the genotype, quantity of HCV RNA, and mode of acquisition of hepatitis C infection, were not associated with higher fibrosis progression. A standard drink contains 12 g of alcohol and is equivalent to 360 mL (12 oz) of beer, 150 mL (5 oz) of wine, or 45 mL (1.5 oz) of whiskey or other 80 proof distilled spirits.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar conclusions were reached in another report that focused on 1667 HCV-positive injection drug users who were followed for a median of nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The relative risk of end-stage liver disease was increased almost fourfold for those who drank more than 260 g of alcohol per week (RR 3.6, 95% CI 1.73 to 7.52).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis pooled data from 16 studies involving more than 15,000 patients looking at the impact of alcohol on those with HCV.

However, fibrosis in non-veterans was significantly associated with increased alcohol consumption (men &gt;150 kg lifetime: four to five drinks per day for &gt;10 years; women &gt;100 kg lifetime: &gt;3 drinks per day for &gt;10 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>The exact amount of alcohol that increases the risk of HCC in patients with HCV is unknown but it appears that even modest alcohol use can accelerate fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This was illustrated in a study of 800 patients with HCV who underwent liver biopsies and in whom a detailed alcohol history was assessed. A spectrum of fibrosis was observed for each category of alcohol intake (none, light, moderate, and heavy).</p><p>Another study of 3404 newly referred patients with hepatitis C identified factors associated with severe liver disease (ie, cirrhosis or liver cancer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Patients with severe liver disease were more likely to have past excessive alcohol consumption defined as &gt;21 glasses per week for women, &gt;28 glasses per week for men (adjusted OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.9-3.5).

Patients were categorized as having HCV without heavy alcohol use (HAU), HAU without HCV, HCV plus HAU, and all others. Among men, those with HAU and HCV had a significantly lower mean age of death when compared with those with HCV alone (50 versus 55 years).

The mechanisms underlying this interaction are poorly understood. The following examples illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case control study included 305 patients with newly diagnosed HCC (of whom 122 were HCV RNA positive) who were compared to 610 controls without liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The risk of HCC was increased 26-fold in patients who were HCV RNA positive (Odds ratio 26.3, 95% CI 15.8 to 44). The risk was increased 126-fold among patients who were HCV RNA positive who consumed more than 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of alcohol (Odds ratio 126, 95% CI 42.8 to 373). An additional finding from this study was an increased risk of HCC in patients with concomitant infection with hepatitis B (Odds ratio 132, 95% CI 15.3 to 54.0), a finding that has been confirmed in several other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort study included 290 consecutive patients with cirrhosis (69 percent of whom were positive for HCV antibodies) who were followed with periodic ultrasound examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. During an average follow-up of 46 months, HCC developed in 32 patients (11 percent), including 20 percent of those who were HBsAg positive, 12 percent of those who were HCV antibody positive, and 14 percent of those with a history of alcohol abuse. On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of the development of HCC included positivity for HBsAg and HCV antibodies, male gender, and alcohol abuse. These results were comparable to an earlier prospective study with a similar design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case-control study included 115 cases who were compared with 230 controls with non-liver cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of HCC included antibodies against HCV or HBV, heavy alcohol consumption, and diabetes mellitus. The risk appeared to be synergistic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one small study, bile duct dysplasia was found to be associated with chronic HCV and alcohol cirrhosis.

Several in vitro studies have demonstrated upregulation of HCV replication (about a threefold increase at 96 hours) and protein expression in cells treated in an alcohol rich environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. Disparate data have also been published, although differences in experimental techniques may have accounted for the varying results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Several studies have also suggested that HCV RNA is increased in drinkers compared with nondrinkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/10,18,30,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18,30,48</a>]. However, the strength of this association is unclear. A meta-analysis of 14 studies found no significant association between HCV RNA levels and the amount of alcohol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Other authors have looked at the acute effect of alcohol on HCV levels in patients. One such report included 21 patients with chronic hepatitis C who were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of alcohol (50 g) versus placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. No significant effects on HCV RNA were detected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol affects host cellular immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have evaluated the interaction of HCV and alcohol on host cellular immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/47,51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,51-55</a>]. The following general observations have been made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol influences hepatocyte transduction pathways possibly acting with HCV to induce alterations in cellular responses to HCV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Host dendritic cells are modulated by HCV infection and by alcohol. The presence of HCV proteins (core and NS3) reduced dendritic cell differentiation in vitro while alcohol further reduced dendritic cell function by decreasing T cell stimulation and interferon production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/53,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,55</a>]. These effects inhibited the antiviral response. Animal models of long-term alcohol consumption have also demonstrated an impaired cellular immune response to HCV infection attributable to altered dendritic cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of alcohol inhibits the antiviral actions of exogenous interferon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol consumption did not influence T cell immune responses (interferon gamma and IL-10 production) in HCV or <span class=\"nowrap\">HCV/HIV</span> coinfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol and HCV increase oxidative stress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol intake increases oxidative stress in patients with HCV.

The risk of developing oxidative stress during chronic hepatitis C infection was increased threefold by moderate alcohol intake (&lt;50gm <span class=\"nowrap\">ethanol/day)</span> and 13- to 24-fold in chronic hepatitis C patients with heavy alcohol intake (&gt;50 gm <span class=\"nowrap\">ethanol/day)</span>. The authors conclude that HCV and alcohol act synergistically in stimulating free radical generation as well affecting antioxidant defenses.</p><p>In vivo observations are further confirmed with in vitro studies. In studies of hepatoma cells, HCV protein, enhanced CYP2E1 expression, and alcohol acted synergistically to enhance reactive oxygen species and sensitize cells to mitochondrial depolarization and cell death by TNF or oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>HCV alters the redox state of hepatocytes leading to changes in mitochondrial structure and function. As an example, the HCV NS5a protein appears to contribute to development of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). HCV core protein induces ER stress, an effect exacerbated by alcohol, thereby further oxidizing the mitochondrial antioxidant (glutathione) pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Oxidative stress may contribute to liver injury and impair liver regeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/56,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol increases HCV quasispecies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis C exists as closely related &quot;quasispecies&quot;. Alcohol increases the diversity of HCV quasispecies by mechanisms that are poorly understood. One theory is that the generation of reactive oxygen species (see above) increases the mutation rate of the HCV genome, thereby driving viral evolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>However, the clinical implications of alcohol and HCV quasispecies diversification are unclear. On the one hand, increased quasispecies complexity has been associated with poor responsiveness to interferon-alfa, possibly contributing to the decreased responsiveness of alcoholic patients with HCV to interferon treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Effect of alcohol on treatment of hepatitis C'</a> below.)</p><p>On the other hand, low quasispecies diversification has been associated with more severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. This may reflect immune failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> selective outgrowth of aggressive viral variants. In one such report, alcohol had no significant association between the degree of quasispecies diversification and the severity of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGIC CORRELATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver histology in patients with alcoholic liver disease and HCV may demonstrate the typical histologic features of alcoholic liver disease, such as macrovesicular steatosis, polymorphonuclear infiltrate, hepatocyte ballooning, and Mallory bodies. Superimposed features of chronic hepatitis, such as periportal necrosis, portal inflammation, lymphoid aggregates in the portal tracts, and lymphocytosis in the sinusoids, are also commonly present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/14,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,63,64</a>].

The reason for the decreased responsiveness is incompletely understood. It may in part be due to decreased compliance, although several biological mechanisms have also been hypothesized, such as potentiation of HCV replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/44,45,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45,68,69</a>].

Considered together, the studies suggest that past alcohol use has no impact on treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/68,70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,70-72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW MUCH ALCOHOL IS TOO MUCH?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The amount of alcohol required to increase the risk of disease progression in patients with HCV has not been well defined. Although most of the studies discussed above included patients with alcohol intake of &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> more modest alcohol intake (&lt;140 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/week)</span> has been associated with increased HCV viremia and hepatic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Even modest alcohol intake is associated with increased oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-alcohol/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>A standard drink contains 12 g of alcohol and is equivalent to 360 mL (12 oz) of beer, 150 mL (5 oz) of wine, and 45 mL (1.5 oz) of whiskey or other 80 proof distilled spirits. Thus, modest alcohol intake translates into approximately two standard size beers per day, an amount that can easily be considered social drinking. Thus, a conservative recommendation that can be unambiguously interpreted when counseling patients is that alcohol should be avoided altogether, particularly prior to antiviral treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3478550975\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

As a result, we suggest total abstinence of alcohol in patients with chronic HCV, particularly before initiation and during antiviral therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
