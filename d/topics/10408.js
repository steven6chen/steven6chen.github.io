Most episodes are brief and do not cause symptoms, esophageal injury, or other complications. In contrast, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when the reflux episodes are associated with symptoms or complications. The type of symptoms and complications of GERD in children vary with the child's age.</p><p>Several treatment options are available for controlling symptoms and preventing complications in children with GERD. The choice among them depends upon the patient's age, the type and severity of symptoms, and response to treatment.</p><p>This topic review focuses on the management of GERD in children and adolescents.

Lifestyle changes also may be helpful as an adjunct to pharmacologic treatment in patients with moderate or severe symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). </p><p>The type of lifestyle changes that may be beneficial depend upon the patient's age and symptom characteristics. Because few studies have examined the efficacy of lifestyle modifications in children and adolescents with GERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], recommendations are mostly extrapolated from studies in adults. Even in adults, there is limited evidence supporting efficacy for these interventions, as is discussed separately.

There is some evidence that these lifestyle changes improve laboratory measures of reflux (such as lower esophageal sphincter pressure), but no clinical evidence that they consistently improve reflux symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary modification &ndash; Trial of avoidance of a core group of reflux-inducing foods, including chocolate, peppermint, and caffeinated beverages, that may reduce lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Acidic beverages, including colas and orange juice also may exacerbate symptoms. Avoidance of high fat foods is also recommended for adults because fat slows gastric emptying and thereby promotes reflux, although the benefit of reducing fat intake in children is unproven. Decisions about whether to restrict dietary fat also depend on the infant or child's overall nutritional status. Because sensitivity to each of these triggers varies among individuals, dietary restriction should be limited to those foods that are associated with symptoms in a specific patient. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positioning &ndash; Avoid the supine position soon after eating. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salivation &ndash; Promote salivation by either chewing gum or using oral lozenges.

These substances reduce lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and smoking also diminishes salivation.</p><p/><p>A number of lifestyle modifications also are used to manage GER in infants, including changes in feeding, positioning, and avoidance of tobacco smoke. These issues are discussed in detail in a separate topic review.

This suggestion is primarily based on randomized studies in adults, which demonstrated that PPIs are effective and superior to H2RAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. As compared with H2RAs, PPIs produce a greater reduction in acid secretion, have a longer duration of action, and tolerance does not develop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;</a>.) <br/><br/>Studies of PPIs in children and adolescents with esophagitis or marked GERD symptoms provide indirect evidence of their efficacy in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Several case series report that PPIs have healed severe esophagitis that had been unresponsive to H2RAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The only controlled trials compare PPIs with alternate forms of acid suppression. These demonstrated that PPIs were as effective as H2RAs for initial treatment of esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], marked GERD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], or maintenance of remission after initial treatment with PPIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, available studies in children provide only indirect evidence of PPI efficacy because they are only shown to be equivalent to alternate acid-suppressing regimens for symptom relief and histologic healing, although PPIs are more effective in reducing gastric acidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Our suggestion that PPIs be selected in preference to other forms of acid suppression in patients with documented esophagitis is based on this indirect evidence and extrapolation from studies in adults, as well as observations that H2RAs are more likely to be associated with tachyphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,14</a>]. In addition, there may be better compliance with PPIs that can be given once daily as compared with multiple-dose regimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asthma and other GERD manifestations</strong> &ndash; The benefit of PPIs on extraesophageal manifestations of GERD in children such as asthma has not been well studied, although they are being used for this purpose in children based upon data in adults. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Asthma with GER'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroesophageal reflux and asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infants</strong> &ndash; Several randomized trials and a systematic review concluded that PPIs are <strong>not</strong> valuable in infants with irritability or regurgitation, because they do not improve symptoms as compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15-17</a>]. However, PPIs or other acid-suppressing regimens are appropriate for an infant with marked histologic evidence of esophagitis on endoscopic biopsies; this is a rare occurrence in this age group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroesophageal-reflux-in-infants#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroesophageal reflux in infants&quot;, section on 'Pharmacotherapy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dosing guidelines for PPIs vary considerably. Infants and younger children appear to metabolize some PPIs more rapidly and may require higher per-kilogram dosing than older individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55435 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18,19</a>]. However, they should be used with caution in infants because of low efficacy in those with uncomplicated reflux symptoms, and also because the pharmacokinetics of PPIs may be affected by immature cytochrome metabolism in young infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In pediatric studies, effective doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">omeprazole</a> ranged from 0.3 to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (maximum 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> and doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lansoprazole</a> ranged from 0.73 to 1.66 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (maximum 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, there is little evidence to support doses of omeprazole over 40 mg daily for children, even for the treatment of documented esophagitis. &#160;</p><p>Some children may require twice daily dosing to achieve optimal acid suppression; we suggest starting with once daily dosing advancing to twice daily dosing if there is clear symptom improvement with the increased frequency. Some providers alternate doses of a PPI with a H2RA, but there is no specific evidence supporting this practice. The duration of therapy is two to four weeks for moderate to severe heartburn, and four to eight weeks for documented esophagitis. If the esophagitis is severe (erosive), we generally continue PPI treatment for three to six months followed by repeat endoscopy to assess for healing. (See <a href=\"#H409327\" class=\"local\">'Esophagitis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults#H102009998\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Proton pump inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p>Several of these drugs are formulated as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be sprinkled onto soft foods for administration to young children. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Lansoprazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">omeprazole</a> are also available as flavored powders for preparing a suspension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although PPIs are generally well tolerated, long-term studies have raised concerns that long-term treatment with PPIs is associated with increased risk for some infectious, metabolic, and nutritional disorders. Most data on the long-term safety of PPIs are from studies in adults. Because of these safety concerns, patients treated with PPIs should be reevaluated on a regular basis to determine if ongoing use is necessary. In our practice, we attempt to wean patients from PPIs after six months of treatment, and then periodically thereafter, depending on symptom control. (See <a href=\"#H406045\" class=\"local\">'Discontinuing PPIs'</a> below.)</p><p>Potential safety concerns include an increased susceptibility to enteric infections, particularly Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The optimal management strategy to minimize problems with acid rebound has not been established. When attempting to discontinue PPIs in patients treated chronically, we and others gradually taper PPIs to minimize the potential problem of acid rebound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

An alternate approach is to wean the patient initially to a H2RA. The evidence for acid rebound is from studies in adults, and is described in detail in a separate topic review.

H2RAs have moderate effects on GER, as measured by relief of symptoms and mucosal healing, but because they have a relatively rapid onset of action, they are well suited for providing symptomatic relief. However, they are somewhat less effective than the PPI class, especially for chronic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The H2RAs inhibit acid secretion by blocking histamine H2 receptors on the parietal cell.

These studies have shown that H2RAs are superior to placebo for healing esophagitis and improving symptoms, with little clinical difference among the formulations when dosed appropriately.

Many children who have undergone anti-reflux surgery have underlying neurological impairment such as cerebral palsy. Surgery is most often considered for patients with intractable esophagitis or emesis that does not respond to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), or pulmonary disease that is clearly due to aspiration from refluxed material. It may be challenging to discriminate pulmonary disease from aspiration associated with swallowing (antegrade aspiration) from that related to reflux (retrograde aspiration). The evaluation of children with suspected swallowing dysfunction is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction in infants and children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The efficacy of surgery has been supported only by the results of numerous case series that used different inclusion criteria, focused predominantly on neurologically impaired children, had short follow-up periods, and reported variable endpoints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/57-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-64</a>]. These limitations and the absence of controlled trials are critical impediments to defining the role of anti-reflux surgery in the long-term management of GERD in children. In addition, many case series report significant &quot;failure rates&quot; of anti-reflux surgery, mandating caution in selecting patients for this intervention. As an example, a large study of infants with neurological impairment undergoing gastrostomy placement found that concomitant fundoplication did not reduce the rate of reflux-related hospitalizations during the following year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Alternatives to anti-reflux surgery that may be appropriate for some patients include nasojejunal or gastrojejunal feeding, which reduce reflux by bypassing the stomach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children#H115018362\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children#H997691766\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of enteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Poor gastric emptying or aspiration risk'</a>.)</p><p>Some children with neurological impairment and GERD may require percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

In a retrospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], 5 percent of children with a normal pH probe prior to PEG placement, and 29 percent of children with an abnormal pH probe went to have a Nissen fundoplication. For such patients, it is reasonable to perform PEG placement without fundoplication, followed by medical anti-reflux therapy if clinically indicated, and fundoplication in the minority of patients who fail medical therapy. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly performed operation is a Nissen fundoplication. This procedure originally involved passage of the gastric fundus behind the esophagus to encircle up to 6 cm of the distal esophagus. However, many variations and modifications have been described, and a Nissen fundoplication may be performed differently by different surgeons. Variables include approach (transthoracic or abdominal), portion of stomach wall used (anterior and posterior or anterior only), combination with other procedures (eg, vagotomy or gastroplasty), the tightness of the wrap, the completeness (270&ordm; to 360&ordm;) of the wrap, and the length of the wrap.</p><p>The Nissen fundoplication is now performed laparoscopically at many centers.

However, in children with distinct symptoms of heartburn or documented esophagitis, the evidence base for treatment recommendations is analogous to and strengthened by observations in adults. The following recommendations are based upon a review of the available evidence by a committee of experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and from clinical experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H409213\"><span class=\"h2\">Heartburn</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We employ a &quot;step up&quot; approach to simple heartburn symptoms, meaning that we start with conservative options and add more intensive therapy if needed. Patients with alarm symptoms (dysphagia, weight loss, hematemesis, or recurrent vomiting) in addition to heartburn should be referred to a gastroenterologist for an upper endoscopy with biopsy. </p><p>For children and adolescents with mild or infrequent heartburn (averaging once a week or less), we suggest a trial of lifestyle changes (weight management for overweight patients; smoking cessation and avoidance of tobacco smoke; head of bed elevation; and avoidance of chocolate, caffeine, spicy foods, alcohol, and other foods that exacerbate symptoms). Occasional use of antacids or histamine type 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) is acceptable for short-term relief of symptoms, but frequent use (more than <span class=\"nowrap\">once/week)</span> calls for advancement of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle changes'</a> above.)</p><p>If the heartburn symptoms are moderate or severe, or fail to respond to lifestyle changes, we recommend a trial of acid suppression therapy. Either a H2RA or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is a reasonable first choice and a typical trial duration is two to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,82</a>]. However, for patients who do not improve on a H2RA, we recommend treatment with a PPI. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Endoscopy and histology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H409327\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophagitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We employ a &quot;step down&quot; approach to documented esophagitis, meaning that we initiate treatment with intensive pharmacotherapy (standard dose PPIs), then withdraw treatment as tolerated. This is similar to the approach used for adults with esophagitis, except that we tend to use somewhat longer courses of therapy in children, and are more likely to repeat the endoscopy. </p><p>For children with endoscopically documented peptic esophagitis, we recommend acid-suppressing treatment. We suggest using a PPI because these are more effective than H2RAs for initial healing of esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Younger children appear to metabolize PPIs more rapidly and may require higher per-kilogram dosing than older individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55435 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Proton pump inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p>Further evaluation and treatment of patients with esophagitis depends on the severity of the esophagitis at baseline and on the degree of symptom relief. Patients with only mild esophagitis can be treated for four to eight weeks, and reassessed based upon the degree of symptom relief. Those with erosive esophagitis should undergo a repeat endoscopy after three to six months of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The endoscopy is important to demonstrate healing, and also to reassess for the possibility of stricture or development of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). It may be difficult to distinguish peptic esophagitis (ie, esophagitis caused by acid reflux) from EoE, because both disorders are characterized by esophageal eosinophilia, and they have similar symptoms. Esophagitis that persists despite several months of effective acid suppression should raise suspicion for EoE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Endoscopy and histology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Long-term treatment with acid suppressing medications is appropriate if symptoms or endoscopy indicate chronic or recurrent esophagitis, without suspicion for eosinophilic esophagitis. H2RAs are a reasonable choice if brief intermittent courses of treatment are sufficient to control symptoms. When continuous therapy is necessary to control symptoms, we suggest treatment with a PPI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Because there are several safety concerns about long-term use of acid-suppressing medications, patients on continuous treatment should be reassessed periodically. A trial of discontinuing treatment should be considered if the symptoms are well controlled, unless the patient has a history of severe and recurrent esophagitis, or unless the endoscopy demonstrates Barrett esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Children or adolescents with odynophagia (pain with swallowing) also should be evaluated for pill esophagitis (direct mucosal injury from swallowed irritant drugs) and infectious esophagitis caused by cytomegalovirus, herpes, or Candida. Children with either of these symptoms should have a careful evaluation, including an upper endoscopy if an infectious cause is suspected. Empiric treatment for reflux is not recommended unless other causes of the symptoms have been excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Dysphagia or odynophagia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Extraesophageal manifestations of GERD</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Asthma with GER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with persistent moderate to severe asthma (particularly nocturnal wheezing) and clear symptoms suggesting GERD, including frequent heartburn or regurgitation, we suggest a trial of vigorous acid suppression. Treatment trials using a PPI for three months are often used in adults; management after three months depends upon the response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroesophageal reflux and asthma&quot;, section on 'Empiric therapy in patients with symptomatic GERD'</a>.)</p><p>This empiric approach to treatment is appropriate because although GER is an established trigger for asthma in many patients, it is difficult to predict responders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In about 60 percent of children with asthma and clinical or laboratory evidence of GER, asthma control will improve with aggressive treatment for reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,84</a>]. In adults with GERD symptoms and moderate to severe asthma (or nocturnal asthma), randomized controlled trials of PPIs demonstrated small but significant improvements in peak flow or numbers of asthma exacerbations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma#H3749823634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroesophageal reflux and asthma&quot;, section on 'Evidence that GERD treatment improves asthma'</a>.)</p><p>In many patients with asthma, GERD may be silent and diagnosed only with esophageal pH monitoring. Thus, pH monitoring or an empiric trial of anti-reflux treatment should be considered in selected patients with asthma that is difficult-to-control (steroid-dependent) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nocturnal-onset, even in the absence of apparent symptoms of GERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other causes of wheezing should be carefully excluded, including foreign body aspiration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Asthma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of wheezing in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is inadequate evidence to determine the role of anti-reflux surgery for patients with asthma and GERD. Case series in adults and children generally report improvement in respiratory symptoms after fundoplication for selected patients with severe asthma, in whom a relationship to GERD is well established and there has been a clear response to acid suppressing medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,85-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,85-87</a>]. Clinical findings predicting a positive response to surgery include a clear history of reflux symptoms preceding the onset of asthma, a history of recurrent pneumonia, lack of atopic symptoms or seasonal variation, and nocturnal episodes of asthma. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because of variations in selection criteria and lack of randomization in these studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no definitive tests to determine whether GERD is causing recurrent pneumonia in a given patient. Clinical decisions must be based on an individual patient's clinical risk and a combination of tests for GER, aspiration, and immune deficiency. The possibility of antegrade aspiration (aspiration during swallowing) should be fully investigated, because this is a more common cause of recurrent pneumonia than retrograde aspiration (GERD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If the pneumonia is consistently in the same area, an H-type tracheo-esophageal fistula should be considered.

If pulmonary disease is mild, medical treatment with acid suppression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prokinetic agents can be used, as long as pulmonary function can be monitored carefully in follow-up.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medications are the most effective for short- or long-term acid suppression, but also are associated with acid rebound upon discontinuation, as well as some adverse effects with chronic use. Histamine type 2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) appear to be somewhat less effective than PPIs, but are less expensive. They are only useful for short-term acid suppression because tachyphylaxis (tolerance) develops within a few weeks.

However, the prokinetic agents that are currently available either have limited efficacy or significant safety concerns. Thus, we recommend NOT using prokinetic agents for the routine treatment of children with GER or GERD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
