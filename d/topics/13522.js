Although it has found no role as an anti-tumor agent, it is used for the treatment of certain fungal infections. Combination therapy of 5-FC with amphotericin B is recommended for the initial management of severe cryptococcal pneumonia and meningoencephalitis and, less frequently, for select invasive candidal infections. Due to a high incidence of primary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acquired resistance, use of flucytosine as monotherapy is significantly restricted.</p><p>Hematologic and hepatic toxicities may occur with 5-FC administration but can be reduced by monitoring serum concentrations and by adjusting the dose empirically in patients with renal dysfunction. When serum concentration testing is not available, careful monitoring for cytopenias will be necessary.</p><p>The pharmacology of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> will be discussed here. The clinical use of flucytosine is discussed separately.

Intrinsic resistance is due to impaired cellular uptake secondary to a mutation in cytosine permease. Acquired resistance results from defects in 5-FC metabolism through mutations in cytosine deaminase or uracil phosphoribosyl transferase and is thought to be a result of either failure of the organism to metabolize the agent or loss of pyrimidine biosynthesis feedback control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The rate of mutation is frequent enough that a resistant mutant strain could be selected during high-burden infections (&ge;10<sup>6</sup> colony-forming units).</p><p>In vitro data from clinical isolates do not always accurately reflect the incidence of resistance to 5-FC. As an example, <em>Candida albicans </em>demonstrating heterozygous resistance traits are frequently seen among clinical strains. These isolates demonstrate only slight increases in minimum inhibitory concentrations in vitro. However, under clinical conditions of drug exposure, selection of organisms that are more resistant may lead to treatment failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly the National Committee on Laboratory Standards) has established methods to standardize in vitro testing against <em>Candida </em>spp.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryptococcus neoformans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The in vitro activity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> against <em>Cryptococcus </em>spp varies significantly among reports. Primary resistance rates have been reported to have ranged from 1 to 25 percent of <em>C. neoformans </em>isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Non-neoformans strains of <em>Cryptococcus</em> may exhibit higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to 5-FC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The in vitro activity of the combination of 5-FC with amphotericin B against cryptococcal isolates is generally at least additive in 5-FC&ndash;susceptible isolates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Candida</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reports of in vitro activity of 5-FC against <em>Candida</em> spp have varied by geographic location and species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The reported incidence of resistance of <em>Candida albicans</em> to 5-FC ranges from 4 to 15 percent. Most strains of <em>C. glabrata</em> are susceptible to 5-FC. In one report, over 8800 <em>Candida</em> isolates obtained globally were tested for intrinsic resistance to 5-FC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Overall, 95 percent of the isolates evaluated demonstrated in vitro susceptibility. With the exception of <em>C. krusei</em> (only 5 percent susceptible), resistance among a variety of <em>Candida </em>spp tested was uncommon. A later study that tested the in vitro activity of 5-FC against 254 clinical isolates of <em>C. krusei</em> collected worldwide found a similar rate of susceptibility (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Although infrequent, clonal outbreaks of 5-FC resistance in select <em>Candida</em> spp have been reported. In one such report, 45 (35 percent) of 130 <em>C. tropicalis</em> bloodstream isolates over a four-year period were reported to be 5-FC resistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The resistant clone was seen more commonly in patients with malignancies, particularly hematologic malignancies.</p><p>When 5-FC is tested in vitro in combination with amphotericin B against <em>Candida </em>spp, an additive effect or synergy was reported in 35 of 40 (85 percent) of isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other fungi</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>5-FC demonstrates activity in vitro against less pathogenic fungi including <em>Rhodotorula</em> spp and <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In addition, most organisms responsible for chromoblastomycosis and some dematiaceous fungi (<em>Cladophialophora </em>spp, <em>Phialophora </em>spp) are susceptible to 5-FC in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The endemic mycoses (<em>Histoplasma</em>, <em>Blastomyces</em>, <em>Coccidioides </em>species), most <em>Aspergillus </em>species, zygomycetes, and most dermatophytes are resistant in vitro to 5-FC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>5-FC is available only as an oral capsule in the United States, although an intravenous (IV) formulation is available in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Peak serum levels of 30 to 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> occur one to two hours after a single oral dose of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. Oral absorption of 5-FC may be reduced in patients with advanced AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>5-FC is widely distributed due in part to a low degree of protein binding (approximately 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Favorable penetration into bone, vertebral discs, and peritoneal and synovial fluid has been documented. Drug concentrations achieved in the spleen, heart, liver, kidney, and lung are equal to those found in the serum. 5-FC levels in the cerebrospinal fluid are approximately 60 to 80 percent of simultaneous serum levels, whereas urine levels are generally several-fold higher than simultaneous serum levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Up to 96 percent of the total dose of 5-FC is eliminated as unchanged drug in the urine, primarily by glomerular filtration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The elimination half-life of 5-FC ranges from three to eight hours (average six hours) in patients with normal renal function but may extend for up to 60 to 250 hours in patients with end-stage renal disease. Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis remove significant amounts of 5-FC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DOSING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>5-FC should be given orally in four divided doses (25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> at six-hour intervals) in both adult and pediatric patients. Because of the commercial availability of a 250 mg capsule, individual oral doses are usually rounded to the nearest 250 mg, especially in adults.</p><p>Although the published dose range of 5-FC in adults with normal renal function is 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, we recommend that a total dose of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day not be exceeded. There is rarely an indication for doses higher than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day but, if used, the risk of toxicity is significant.</p><p>Excessive serum concentrations of 5-FC have been reported in children (especially neonates) even with standard dosing of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], so careful monitoring is particularly important in such patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dose modification is necessary in patients with renal dysfunction.

In one case report about a patient receiving 5-FC while undergoing continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), supratherapeutic 5-FC concentrations were observed despite dose reductions (up to 50 percent) beyond those routinely made for intermittent hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>It is particularly important to monitor the 5-FC serum concentration in patients with renal impairment, as discussed below.

In particular, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia can limit its use.</p><p>Most of the hematologic toxicity associated with 5-FC is thought to result from the in vivo conversion of 5-FC to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (5-FU) even though studies have correlated bone marrow toxicity more with 5-FC than 5-FU levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. 5-FC may convert to 5-FU spontaneously or under the influence of <em>Escherichia coli</em> in the gut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although the enzymes responsible for this conversion are thought to be induced by chronic exposure, toxicity most often occurs during the first two weeks of treatment. Renal dysfunction caused by the concomitant administration of nephrotoxic agents, such as amphotericin B, can lead to 5-FC accumulation and further contribute to dose-related toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Approximately 5 percent of patients develop elevations in serum aminotransferases or alkaline phosphatase, and hepatic necrosis has been reported. As a result, a strong indication must be present to justify administration of 5-FC to patients with severe liver dysfunction. These hematologic and hepatic abnormalities are seen primarily in patients whose peak serum 5-FC concentrations exceed 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occur in up to 6 percent of patients. However, such reactions are less clearly related to serum concentrations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SERUM CONCENTRATION MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring of serum 5-FC concentrations is performed in order to reduce the risk of toxicity, particularly hematologic toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. It is particularly important to monitor the 5-FC concentration in patients with renal dysfunction, since the drug accumulates in this setting, which can lead to toxicity. In a retrospective study that included 53 intensive care unit patients, patients with serum concentrations &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> were significantly more likely to develop thrombocytopenia and hepatotoxicity than those with lower serum concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Measurement of serum 5-FC concentrations is recommended after three to five days of therapy and should be obtained two hours after a dose has been administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Guidelines for the treatment of cryptococcal infections recommend peak concentrations between 30 and 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL;</span> concentrations &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Serum drug concentrations should be repeated if renal function worsens or if leukopenia or thrombocytopenia occurs.</p><p>All patients receiving 5-FC should undergo regular monitoring of the complete blood count (CBC). In settings in which serum 5-FC concentrations are not available, CBC monitoring two to three times per week provides an indirect method of screening for excessive dosing. An otherwise unexplained reduction in the neutrophil or platelet count may reflect 5-FC toxicity and either the drug should be stopped or the dose reduced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dose reductions in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction or in those with excessive serum concentrations may help to reduce hematologic and hepatic toxicities resulting from 5-FC administration. While further dose reductions (resulting in reductions in serum concentrations) may permit the continuation of therapy, it would generally not be advisable to reduce serum concentrations below target. In most clinical scenarios, alternate therapies exist, which facilitate the ability to discontinue therapy in patients for whom toxicity is severe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG INTERACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concomitant aluminum hydroxide or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-hydroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium hydroxide</a> delays absorption of 5-FC. The effect of other drugs that raise gastric pH (such as other antacids, histamine-2 antagonists, or proton pump inhibitors) has not been reported. 5-FC is not known to affect the hepatic cytochrome P450 system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/19,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,30</a>].</p><p>Concomitant administration of agents with toxicities similar to 5-FC should be approached with caution. As an example, patients with AIDS who are treated with 5-FC for cryptococcal meningitis may be receiving other agents with hematologic toxicities, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>. In addition, drugs known to cause renal dysfunction (such as amphotericin B and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a>) may alter the elimination of 5-FC and predispose to toxicities related to excessive 5-FC concentrations.</p><p>Although the product information document states that the antifungal activity of 5-FC can be competitively inhibited by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], there are no published data to support this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the in vivo conversion of 5-FC to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 5-FC should be avoided during pregnancy if possible. 5-FU is suspected of being capable of producing congenital anomalies in humans, and 5-FC has been shown to be teratogenic in rats. However, 5-FC has been reported to have been used during pregnancy in several cases without complications. It may be necessary to use 5-FC with amphotericin B in some pregnant patients with cryptococcal meningitis, but the potential risks and justification to use this agent during pregnancy should be discussed with the patient and the appropriate consent obtained whenever possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3099668465\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG COST AND AVAILABILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>5-FC availability and costs vary widely.

Furthermore, in most African and Asian countries, despite the high incidence of cryptococcal diseases, 5-FC is not available despite ongoing advocacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. In addition, a wide variability in drug costs for 5-FC exists, ranging from $4.60 to $1409 per day. A two-week course costs $22,000 in the United States compared with $22 in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-flucytosine-5-fc/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Flucytosine</a> (5-FC) exerts its antifungal effects by interfering with both DNA and protein synthesis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5-FC (in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B) is the induction therapy of choice for cryptococcal meningoencephalitis and severe cryptococcal pneumonia. It is used less commonly as part of a combination regimen for select invasive candidal infections. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical uses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Due to a high incidence of primary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acquired resistance, use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> as monotherapy is significantly restricted. Select cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">chromoblastomycosis/phaeohyphomycosis</span> and genitourinary candidal infections that are not life threatening and for which treatment alternatives, such as azoles, are not possible may be considered for monotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of resistance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical uses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistance to 5-FC is thought to be a result of either failure of the organism to metabolize the agent or loss of pyrimidine biosynthesis feedback control. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5-FC has activity in vitro against <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>, many <em>Candida</em> spp, <em>Rhodotorula</em> spp, <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, most of the organisms responsible for chromoblastomycosis, and some dematiaceous fungi. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5-FC is available in the United States only as an oral capsule. Approximately 80 to 90 percent of 5-FC is absorbed following oral administration. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The usual dosing of 5-FC in patients with normal renal function is 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> orally every six hours. Because of the commercial availability of a 250 mg capsule, individual oral doses are usually rounded to the nearest 250 mg, especially in adults. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Dosing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dose modification is necessary in patients with renal dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Dose modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most significant toxicities of 5-FC are hematologic, hepatic, and gastrointestinal. (See <a href=\"#H2721465985\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum 5-FC concentrations should be monitored in order to reduce the risk of toxicities, particularly hematologic toxicity. It is particularly important to monitor the 5-FC serum concentration in patients with renal impairment. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Serum concentration monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of serum 5-FC concentrations is recommended after three to five days of therapy, when available, and should be obtained two hours after a dose has been administered. Peak serum concentrations should be between 30 and 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL;</span> concentrations &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> should be avoided. In settings in which serum 5-FC concentrations are not available, complete blood count monitoring two to three times per week provides an indirect method of screening for excessive dosing. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Serum concentration monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the in vivo conversion of 5-FC to 5-fluorouracil and the possible teratogenicity of both compounds, 5-FC should be avoided during pregnancy if possible. It may be necessary to use 5-FC with amphotericin B in some pregnant patients with cryptococcal meningitis, but the potential risks and justification to use this agent during pregnancy should be discussed with the patient and the appropriate consent obtained whenever possible.
