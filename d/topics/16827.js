This treatment modality may be useful in some patients with psoriasis, vitiligo, and other inflammatory or lymphoproliferative skin conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F104201\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104201 \">table 1</a>) involving a limited area of the body (&lt;10 percent of the body surface area) or difficult-to-treat anatomical areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the mechanism of action, clinical indications, treatment protocols, and side effects of targeted phototherapy.

Both laser and nonlaser devices can deliver UV radiation (wavelength range 193 to 380 nm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70045 \">figure 1</a>)) that is absorbed in the epidermis and superficial dermis by skin chromophores.</p><p>The principal skin chromophore is nuclear DNA. The absorption of UVB (290 to 320 nm) by nucleotides leads to the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine (6-4)-photoproducts, which are then either repaired or marked for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the p53 tumor suppressor gene system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. UVB also acts on cytoplasm and cell membrane components (including cell surface receptors, kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors) and induces the release of a variety of proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines from keratinocytes and T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Decreased cell proliferation, immunosuppression, and T cell apoptosis may contribute to the UVB-mediated suppression of disease activity in inflammatory and lymphoproliferative skin disorders, such as psoriasis and mycosis fungoides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In vitiligo, UVB promotes the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of melanocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In cutaneous mastocytosis (urticaria pigmentosa), UVB radiation reduces the release of histamine from basophils and mast cells, resulting in decreased itch and fewer urticarial lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951692261\"><span class=\"h1\">DEVICES FOR TARGETED PHOTOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common lasers used for targeted phototherapy in clinicians' offices are the excimer lasers, which operate in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range between 193 and 351 nm. These lasers use an active medium composed of excited dimers, which are a combination of a noble gas (eg, argon, krypton, or xenon) and a reactive halogen gas (eg, fluorine or chlorine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The 308 nm xenon-chloride laser is most commonly used to treat dermatologic conditions. Although effective, laser devices tend to be bulky and expensive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-medical-lasers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of medical lasers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nonlaser devices can also be used to deliver localized UV to targeted lesions. They may use high-pressure burners, fluorescent bulbs, or other approaches to emit UV light and may be delivered to the skin either directly from the bulb or via fiber-optic cable systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Nonlaser excimer lamps are generally smaller, less costly, and require less maintenance than lasers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; some are available that can be used by patients at home and may be as effective as in-office treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. A nonlaser device can sometimes be filtered to provide either UVA (330 to 380 nm) or UVB (290 to 330 nm), which cannot be done with excimer lasers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/11,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15,16</a>]. Monochromatic excimer nonlaser devices have been developed, but are not yet FDA-approved for use in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951692267\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most common indications for targeted ultraviolet (UV) therapy include localized forms of moderate to severe psoriasis that are unresponsive to topical therapy, vitiligo, severe atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and lymphoproliferative skin disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Localized phototherapy is useful for difficult-to-treat areas (scalp, palms, and soles) in patients with psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Additional indications are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F104201\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104201 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951692273\"><span class=\"h1\">DOSING AND TREATMENT REGIMENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no widely accepted, disease-specific protocols for targeted phototherapy, due to lack of standardization among devices and limited evidence from high-quality studies. Only a few small studies have assessed the excimer laser dose-response relationship in psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>One approach supported by expert consensus involves determining the minimal erythema dose (MED) on normal skin prior to initial treatment. The MED is the lowest effective UV radiation dose producing erythema or &quot;sunburn&quot; of the skin within a few hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A dose of two to four MED can be given as the initial treatment. The dose can be increased or reduced during the course of treatment based upon response to therapy and side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Another approach involves following the directions of the device's manufacturer for dosing. An example of protocol for a specific laser for psoriasis treatment is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F104164\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104164 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Generally accepted treatment frequency is two to three treatment sessions per week, for a total of 10 to 20 treatments, or until the lesion is cleared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Treatments should be given at least 48 hours apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. For psoriasis, limited data show an average remission time of three to five months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951692279\"><span class=\"h1\">COMBINATION THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both topical and systemic agents can be used in conjunction with targeted phototherapy with the goal of improving efficacy and reducing the radiation dose. Evidence supporting the combination of targeted phototherapy with topical or systemic agents is mainly derived from a few studies of targeted and nontargeted narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy for the treatment of psoriasis and vitiligo:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small trial, patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and nontargeted narrowband UVB achieved a 90 percent improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) more rapidly than patients treated with placebo plus narrowband UVB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The median time to clearance was four weeks (range two to six) in the combination treatment group, whereas more than 50 percent of patients in the UVB alone group were not clear at 24 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small study, the combination of targeted narrowband&nbsp;phototherapy with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcipotriol-calcipotriene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcipotriol</a> was more effective than phototherapy alone or phototherapy in combination with topical psoralen gel for the treatment of localized plaque psoriasis (PASI improvement after 30 treatments 67, 34, and 30 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of targeted phototherapy with biologics has not been studied, but nontargeted narrowband UVB phototherapy augments the response to biologics in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Presumably, targeted phototherapy would have a similar effect. However, data are preliminary and there is theoretical concern that the combination of phototherapy with anti-TNF agent treatment may increase the risk of photocarcinogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of two left-right intraindividual comparison studies comparing topical 0.1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> plus 308 nm xenon-chloride excimer laser with placebo plus laser for the treatment of vitiligo demonstrated that patches treated with the combination of topical tacrolimus plus laser were more likely to achieve 75 percent repigmentation than those treated with laser alone (RR 3.15; 95% CI 1.46-6.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study including 38 patients with vitiligo compared tacalcitol plus targeted therapy with 308 nm monochromatic excimer light with placebo plus targeted phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A greater proportion of participants in the combination treatment group achieved greater than 75 percent repigmentation (relative risk [RR] 4.50; 95% CI 1.05-19.35). However, a systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that while topical calcineurin inhibitors in conjunction with excimer phototherapy is more effective than excimer alone, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that either vitamin D or corticosteroid added to the efficacy of excimer alone in the treatment of vitiligo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observational studies indicate that topical or systemic retinoids enhance the response to PUVA or UVB phototherapy and reduce treatment frequency, duration, and cumulative UVB doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/22,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,31-33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaseline and other emollients can increase UV penetration by altering the optical properties of the stratum corneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Although evidence-based data are scant, some experts suggest applying a thin petrolatum layer just prior to UV treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951692285\"><span class=\"h1\">TARGETED VERSUS FULL-BODY PHOTOTHERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H252290073\"><span class=\"h2\">Advantages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advantages of targeted phototherapy include less toxicity to normal skin, fewer treatments, and a lower cumulative UV dose, compared with whole-body phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted therapy delivers a higher amount of radiation in a shorter period of time only to the individual lesions, avoiding unnecessary exposure to UV of the unaffected skin. This minimizes short- and long-term adverse effects of UV radiation exposure, such as sunburn and skin cancer. If burns do occur, they tend to be better tolerated, since they are limited to the lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because diseased skin often tolerates larger UV doses than normal skin, the initial treatments can use higher UV doses, resulting in a lower number of treatment sessions needed to achieve a response. Treatment duration may also be shorter with targeted phototherapy, unless very large areas are treated, and visits for treatment can be less frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Moreover, refractory skin lesions not treated adequately with full-body phototherapy may respond to a more powerful, directed radiation treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted phototherapy is particularly useful to treat difficult-to-treat anatomical locations. Lesions of the scalp, nose, genitals, oral mucosa, and ears are more easily and conveniently treated with targeted phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted phototherapy devices are available for home use.

More extensive disease is more easily and conveniently treated with conventional broadband or narrowband UVB treatments.</p><p>Targeted phototherapy is not widely available and is more expensive than conventional phototherapy, due to the higher cost of the machines for targeted phototherapy compared with the equipment used for full-body UVB treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951692291\"><span class=\"h1\">SAFETY MEASURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Safety measures and contraindications should be reviewed with the patient prior to initiating treatment with targeted phototherapy. Safety measures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protecting the skin surrounding the treated area by using a sunscreen with an SPF of 50+ or a physical barrier</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using topical emollients and moisturizers for treated erythematous, dry, or blistering areas</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding additional sun exposure to treated areas</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951692297\"><span class=\"h1\">SHORT- AND LONG-TERM ADVERSE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-term adverse effects of targeted phototherapy include localized erythema, burning, skin dryness and flaking, pruritus, and blistering, usually with higher doses. Hyperpigmentation of the treated areas may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/targeted-phototherapy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Long-term adverse effects of targeted phototherapy have not been extensively studied. They are theoretical and may include localized photoaging and possibly photocarcinogenesis. However, the risk of long-term adverse effects is expected to be smaller than with nontargeted phototherapy, because a much smaller skin area is exposed to UV when using a targeted approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951692303\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absolute contraindications for targeted phototherapy are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Xeroderma pigmentosum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lupus erythematosus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Photosensitivity disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome)</p><p/><p>Relative contraindications to targeted UVB therapy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of melanoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of non-melanoma skin cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of treatment with arsenic or ionizing radiation because of the increased risk for skin cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppression (eg, in organ transplant patients)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951692309\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted phototherapy is the localized delivery of ultraviolet light (UV) to affected areas of the skin with laser and nonlaser devices.
