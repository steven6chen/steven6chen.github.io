The current classification system, which was agreed upon at the 2003 Congress of the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease, consists of two major categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulvar pain related to a specific disorder:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infectious (eg, candidiasis, trichomoniasis, herpes simplex virus) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inflammatory (eg, lichen simplex chronicus, lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, atrophic vaginitis, immunobullous disorder)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neoplastic (eg, Paget disease, squamous cell carcinoma)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neurologic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65491\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65491 \">table 1</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vulvodynia</strong> &ndash; Vulvar discomfort, most often described as burning pain, occurring in the absence of relevant visible findings or a specific, clinically identifiable, neurologic disorder. The term vestibulitis has been eliminated from this terminology because the presence of inflammation (implied by the suffix &ldquo;-it is&rdquo;) has not be documented. Vulvodynia is divided into two subcategories: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Generalized</strong> &ndash; Generalized vulvar discomfort that is provoked (by physical contact that is sexual, nonsexual, or both); unprovoked; or mixed (a combination of provoked and unprovoked).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Localized</strong> (eg, vestibulodynia, clitorodynia, hemivulvodynia) &ndash; Localized vulvar pain that is provoked (by physical contact that is sexual, nonsexual, or both); unprovoked; or mixed. </p><p/><p>Generalized vulvodynia will be discussed in this topic review.</p><p>Despite this definition, the diagnosis and treatment of vulvodynia remain controversial, neither clinicians nor researchers have a consistent approach to either [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In surveys, 3 to 16 percent of women report a history of vulvar pain lasting at least three months and 4 to 7 percent report current symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. White and African American women have a similar lifetime prevalence of vulvar pain, while Hispanic women are 80 percent more likely to experience chronic vulvar pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>A prospective study of 2277 women who did not meet criteria for a diagnosis of vulvodynia on an initial survey found an incidence of vulvodynia of 11.3 percent over three years of follow-up (4.2 cases per 100 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Risk factors for the development of vulvodynia included: younger age (7.6 cases per 100 person-years at age 20 years compared with 3.3 cases per 100 person-years at age 60 years); Hispanic ethnicity (9.5 cases per 100 person-years); married or living as married (4.9 cases per 100 person-years); depression (6.7 cases per 100 person-years); posttraumatic stress disorder (5.6 cases per 100 person-years); sleep dysfunction (5.1 to 6.9 cases per 100 person-years); and other chronic pain conditions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histology of vulvodynia has not been characterized. Histological examination is often normal, but nonspecific histopathologic abnormalities or reactive squamous atypia may be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of vulvodynia is unknown. It has been attributed to changes in estrogen concentration, embryologic abnormalities, increased urinary oxalates, and immune factors. Studies suggest that estrogen affects sensory discrimination and pain sensitivity at multiple sites within the central and peripheral nervous systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Estrogen can also alter innervation of estrogen responsive targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Therefore, when estrogen levels change over the short- or long-term, vulvar nerve density and sensory nociceptors may change. This may explain why vulvodynia often occurs at the onset of menopause. Causal associations with dietary oxalate consumption have been refuted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A possible etiological correlation between the oral contraceptive pill and localized provoked vulvodynia has been investigated in different epidemiological studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-localized-vulvar-pain-syndrome-formerly-vulvodynia-vestibulodynia-vulvar-vestibulitis-or-focal-vulvitis#H1344048950\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of localized vulvar pain syndrome (formerly vulvodynia, vestibulodynia, vulvar vestibulitis, or focal vulvitis)&quot;, section on 'Hormonal'</a>.) </p><p>It is likely that vulvodynia represents neuropathic pain, which is pain arising from abnormal neural activity secondary to disease, irritation, or injury of the nervous system that persists in the absence of ongoing disease or acute injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65491\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65491 \">table 1</a>). Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to susceptibility to neuropathic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The original neural injury can be insignificant, inapparent, or unappreciated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women#H2253078916\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of chronic pelvic pain in women&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Primary or secondary pelvic floor muscle dysfunction may also be a source of chronic burning vulvar pain. Inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, serotonin, prostaglandins, adenosine triphosphate, and histamine, are released locally when muscle fiber trauma occurs and sensitize muscle nociceptors, reducing their mechanical threshold. This leads to muscle hyperalgesia, mechanical allodynia, and peripheral sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As a result, normally innocuous pressure or muscle contractions are perceived as painful.</p><p>With prolonged noxious stimuli, a series of biochemical and neuroinflammatory changes occurs in the central nervous system, leading to central sensitization. Pain impulses are amplified, generation of spontaneous pain impulses occurs, the area of perceived pain enlarges, and normally non-noxious stimuli are perceived as painful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A number of conditions lead to pelvic floor dysfunction and pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evolution of pelvic floor dysfunction may begin in childhood with toilet training, as children learn to squeeze and relax pelvic floor muscles for appropriate timing of voiding and defecation. Hypervigilance with holding urine or stool and becoming unable to relax to void or defecate can continue into adulthood. In adults with hypertonicity of the pelvic floor, it is common to find a history of constipation, vulvar pain, and frequent urinary tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of pelvic floor dysfunction can also occur in adults because of holding patterns, as in teachers who cannot use the bathroom for hours at a time. Likewise, imbalance of the pelvic girdle, gait disturbance, postural abnormalities from musculo-skeletal abnormality such as short leg syndrome, and from vocations can lead to or worsen hypertonicity. Anxiety and history of sexual abuse can enhance most pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traumatic vaginal delivery, difficult forceps or vacuum delivery can result in neuromuscular injury to the pelvic floor leading to pelvic floor muscle spasm, dysfunction, or pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levator avulsion injury can yield postpartum urinary frequency, voiding dysfunction, and pain can persist for years after the delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery that utilizes fixation to pelvic floor sites can induce or worsen pelvic muscle hypertonic dysfunction: levator plications done for correction of rectoceles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and sacrospinous vaginal vault suspensions, mesh placement utilizing levator muscle sites to anchor the repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS),</span> and vulvodynia are the most common sources of pelvic floor hypertonicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These pelvic pain syndromes may prolong noxious stimuli, yielding metabolic, biochemical and electrophysiologic changes in the dorsal horn.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Windup of the dorsal horn results in neuropathic changes that decrease the sensory threshold of afferent nerves, resulting in allodynia. Additionally, this neuroplasticity of the dorsal horn results in neuropathic reflexes, including neurogenic inflammation in the periphery, that lead to viscerovisceral hyperalgesia (also called pelvic organ cross talk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One of the more common neuropathic reflexes not only induces voiding and defecatory problems, but also is a major contributor to the self-perpetuation of visceral pain disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5989401\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain and the brain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pain of vulvodynia probably results from more than one cause, or a combination of factors, all of which differ from woman to woman, and all best understood within the framework of what neuroscience has discovered: that there is an entire system of mind-brain-body interactions related to genetic and psychosocial risk factors, biological <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infectious triggers, coping skills, and personality traits that affect how the brain perceives, processes and manages pain. None of these studies support causality but, at times, the absence of identifiable physiologic pathology has led to the view that the pain may be solely due to psychological factors. This position may be as erroneous as emphasizing only the physiological aspects of the conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In response to stressors of the external and internal environment, the body produces hormonal and neurotransmitter mediators that turn on cellular and tissue responses throughout the body and lead to coordination of physiological response to the circumstances at hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Research has reinforced the fact that classic &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; stress mediators have protective, as well as damaging, effects. As researchers endeavor to discern which mediators protect and which damage, a new formulation addresses the relationship between challenges from the environment and biological response.</p><p>In place of the ambiguous term stress, two new concepts have been formulated. Allostasis represents the brain&rsquo;s constant effort to process daily physical, environmental, social and psychological stressors and return the body to a steady state of balance, or homeostasis. With allostasis, there is stability, or homeostasis, during change. Allostatic load refers to the wear and tear that the body experiences from repeated cycles of allostasis, as well as the inefficient ignition or shut down of these responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. When the body is unable to return to homeostasis, allostatic load is loss of resilience and increased risk of disease. Fear, including social fear, is a significant trigger of the stress response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and a source of allostatic load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Repeated exposure to stress either through early or chronic exposure causes wear and tear on the body&rsquo;s ability to sustain balance and resilience. It is possible that stressful or traumatic life events in the past may &ldquo;prime&rdquo; the brain to contribute to the onset of pain. Adverse life events such as destructive relationships, parental divorce, or adverse childbirth experiences are more frequent in women with vulvodynia than in women without [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>In a population-based study, women with vulvodynia were 2.6 times more likely to report lack of family support (comfort, encouragement, and love). Women who developed vulvodynia as adults were significantly more likely to report childhood abuse (physical or sexual) than age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The brain can actually be remodeled to be less efficient at restoring homeostasis. Demonstration that women with chronic vulvar pain have differences in their brain anatomy compared with age-matched controls supports the concept of the brain as an important modulator of pain in women with vulvodynia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In chronic pain patients, a tendency to focus on pain (attentional bias) increases pain, disability, and distractibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Altered levels of stress hormones and other neurotransmitters affect our thoughts, actions and emotions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Catastrophizing refers to predicting negative outcomes and assuming that the negative outcomes will be catastrophic. Catastrophizing is associated with depression and anxiety, two significant predictors of vestibular pain in postmenopausal women with painful intercourse. Estrogen levels were not predictive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar pain is generally diffuse, constant, and unprovoked. Patients frequently experience great difficulty describing and localizing their pain and often believe they have a constant yeast infection. Other symptoms include constant irritation, a raw sensation, the feeling of grating or sandpaper, the sensation of continual swelling, or feeling as if they are sitting on a hard ball or knot. Paresthesias and dysesthesias are other characteristic features.</p><p>Dyspareunia may or may not occur, but intercourse may trigger subsequent pain. Light touch or pressure may also trigger pain (allodynia) so that tight pants, undergarments, or even the movement of pubic hair may provoke discomfort. Hyperalgesia (ie, increased response to a stimulus that is normally painful) is another clinical feature. Hypertonicity of the pelvic floor may lead to urinary dysfunction or to symptoms resembling urinary tract infection (eg, frequency, urgency, dysuria), but with negative urine cultures. Itching occasionally occurs.</p><p>Although traditionally considered a chronic pain disorder with rare remission, a two-year follow-up survey found one in 10 vulvodynia patients reported remission and 1 in 50 of previously asymptomatic controls developed pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Coexisting medical disorders are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/5,25,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25,37</a>]. A survey of over 1000 women with vulvodynia reported the following frequency of coexisting conditions: low back pain (56 percent); irritable bowel or migraine (31 to 35 percent); painful bladder <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/interstitial</span> cystitis, chemical sensitivities, and fibromyalgia (20 to 27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A similar survey noted that compared to asymptomatic women, women with chronic vulvar pain were significantly more likely to have depression, frequent urinary tract or yeast infections, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, dysmenorrhea, and premenstrual syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of vulvodynia is clinical, based on characteristic findings on history and physical examination. It is largely one of exclusion: specific causes of vulvar pain must be ruled out. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete medical, surgical, and sexual history should be obtained to look for specific conditions that could be causing vulvar pain. A complete pain history should be taken to determine the cause of pain, inciting factors, and its impact on the patient. Is the pain is nociceptive, neuropathic, or both? Appropriate questions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How and when did the pain begin? &mdash; The onset of vulvodynia is often sudden and without precedents. It is important to ask whether there was a precipitating event, such as trauma, childbirth, or surgery that may have injured the pudendal nerve, or did the pain begin spontaneously in an acute or gradual fashion? Does the woman participate in hobbies or occupational activities that may have injured the pudendal nerve? Are there long periods of sitting at work with poor posture and a non-ergonomic chair? Does she frequently ride in a car for long periods? Does she participate in sports or exercise that may aggravate nerve or muscles? Is there a history of inflammatory insult such as recurrent Candida infections that might have sensitized the nerves?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How is the pain described? &mdash; Allow the patient to verbalize the painful symptoms. Where is the location of the pain? Is it focal or generalized? Provoked or unprovoked? Generalized unprovoked pain suggests vulvodynia. Does the pain seem to have a point of emanation, suggesting a specific source? What is the intensity of the pain? Is there a component of itching suggestive of vulvar dermatitis? Are there other signs or symptoms associated with the pain?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there specific skin complaints (pruritus, localized burning, pressure, throbbing) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lesions (mass, ulcer, change in color) suggesting dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia? &mdash; Vulvodynia is more likely if there are no skin lesions or skin complaints, but uncontrolled lichen planus is a significant source of vulvar pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-planus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen planus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there anything relevant in the past medical history? &mdash; Are there medical disorders (herpes simplex or zoster), medications, surgeries, or trauma that could have affected the vulva or referred pain to the vulva (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72042\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72042 \">table 2</a>)? Are common comorbid conditions, such as fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome, present? Ask about past psychological history, particularly with regard to depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. A sexual history is important to confirm that the relationship is loving and there is no history of abuse, but abused women can develop vulvodynia. A history of allergies suggests the possibility of vulvar dermatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there urinary tract symptoms? &mdash; Vulvodynia can be associated with urinary tract symptoms in the setting of a negative urine culture. Vulvodynia can often be mistaken for interstitial cystitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does she have chronic constipation, poor bowel habits, frequent straining and pushing to evacuate?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are her hygienic practices? &mdash; Women often erroneously regard their personal practices (eg, use of panty liners, feminine and contraceptive products, tight lycra garments, perfumed or deodorant soaps) as innocuous since they have engaged in them for a long time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does she have significant orthopedic problems? Any history of degenerative disc disease with possible nerve root impingement in the lumbo-sacral region? Any hip disease that may distort gait?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What previous evaluations have occurred?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What improves the pain?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How does the pain impact upon the patient's life? &mdash; Most women with vulvodynia report a substantial impact on their quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/31,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,37,38</a>].

Discomfort upon separation of the labia minora is one of the most common physical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The vulva should be inspected for visible lesions that could be a source of pain. Bulbocavernosus (gently stroking the labia majora) and anal wink reflexes should be checked, as changes in these reflexes, hyper- and hypesthesia, suggest peripheral neuropathy. Loss of the bulbocavernosus reflex and anal wink require further neurologic evaluation. Bilateral tenderness and trigger points at the insertion of the levator ani suggest vulvodynia may represent myalgia referred from the levators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Spontaneous or elicited pain at the lower third of the anterior vaginal wall suggested bladder-related comorbidities (painful bladder <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/interstitial</span> cystitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The area from mid thigh to the mons should be checked for allodynia, hype-, or hyperesthesia. The location(s) of pain can be mapped on a diagram, with a description of severity (mild, moderate, or severe) at each location.</p><p>A Q-tip test of the vestibule can be performed by untwisting the end of the Q-tip to make a cotton wisp and using this to check for intact sensation to light touch or allodynia (ie, Q- tip wisp feels like a pinch, knife, or sandpaper). Allodynia may be present in both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. The stick of the Q-tip should then be broken to form a sharp point that can be used to test for areas of hype- or hyperesthesia. Provoked pain localized to the vestibule suggests vestibulodynia, while the pain of vulvodynia is unprovoked. Findings in the vestibule and outside the vestibule suggest a mixed pain picture of both vulvodynia and vestibulodynia.

The differential diagnosis of vulvar pain includes: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious etiologies &ndash; Infection, either vulvitis or vaginitis, is a primary consideration in women who present with vulvar pain. Infection is suggested by localized pain and associated symptoms of burning, itching, or irritation. Physical exam findings consistent with infection include edema, erythema, ulcerations, and discharge. Microscopy and vaginal culture are done to identify the infectious etiology. A discussion of vaginitis is found separately.

Clitoral priapism is diagnosed on physical exam; the clitoris is exquisitely painful and edematous. &#160;Bilateral or unilateral vulvar edema may be present. Clitoral priapism results from blockage of venous outflow from the corpora cavernosa. This blockage may result from physical obstruction or failure of the alpha-adrenergic relaxation system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Risk factors for clitoral priapism include antidepressants and psychotropic medications that cause alpha-adrenergic blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

It occurs in the absence of relevant visible infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic findings and in the absence of a specific clinically identifiable, neurologic disorder. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients frequently experience great difficulty describing and localizing their pain and often believe they have a constant yeast infection. Other symptoms include constant irritation, a raw sensation, the feeling of grating or sandpaper, the sensation of continual swelling, or feeling as if they are sitting on a hard ball or knot. Paresthesias and dysesthesias are other characteristic features. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is one of exclusion after infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, and neurologic disorders have been ruled out. Colposcopy and biopsy should be performed to evaluate the skin if there are signs suggestive of vulvar dermatoses or neoplasia, or in patients refractory to therapy.
