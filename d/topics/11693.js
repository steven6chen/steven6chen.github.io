There is significant heterogeneity among the three major trials designed solely to assess the neuroprotective benefits of magnesium sulfate: the Australasian Collaborative Trial of Magnesium Sulfate (ACTOMgSO4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], the Beneficial Effects of Antenatal Magnesium Sulfate (BEAM) trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and the PREMAG trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. These trials are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108643\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108643 \">table 1</a>). It is important to emphasize that the combined outcome of &quot;cerebral palsy or death&quot; is important methodologically, as cerebral palsy and death are competing outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3906535344\"><span class=\"h2\">Death and/or cerebral palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple meta-analyses have evaluated the neuroprotective effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> administered to women at risk of preterm birth and have consistently found a reduction in cerebral palsy in offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. The 2009 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of magnesium sulphate for women at risk of preterm birth for neuroprotection of the fetus is a representative example of this evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Five randomized trials were included: The three trials described above were specifically designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of magnesium sulfate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/3-5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,8</a>], a fourth trial had both a tocolytic arm and a neuroprotective arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and a fifth trial, Magpie, was designed to assess the efficacy of magnesium sulfate for prevention of seizures in women with preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These trials included 6145 infants, of whom 1493 were delivered preterm.</p><p>For subgroup analysis, studies were classified by their primary study intent: neuroprotection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/3,4,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6,8</a>] or &quot;other,&quot; which included seizure prophylaxis (Magpie trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]) in preeclamptic women or tocolysis of preterm labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. For the purpose of the review, the trial with tocolytic and neuroprotective arms was treated as two separate trials, with the subgroup of women in the neuroprotection arm considered along with the other trials designed specifically to assess the neuroprotective role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a>.</p><p>Major findings were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the trials overall, &quot;any&quot; cerebral palsy was significantly reduced (relative risk [RR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.54-0.87). The absolute risk of cerebral palsy was 3.4 percent for fetuses exposed to antenatal magnesium sulphate therapy versus 5 percent for unexposed fetuses, giving an absolute risk reduction of 1.6 percent. The number of women that would need to be treated to prevent one child from developing cerebral palsy was 63 (95% CI 43-87).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the neuroprotection trials subgroup, both &quot;any&quot; cerebral palsy and <span class=\"nowrap\">moderate/severe</span> cerebral palsy were significantly reduced (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.91 and RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.92, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substantial gross motor dysfunction was significantly reduced overall (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.85) and in the neuroprotection trials subgroup (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43-0.83).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Death or cerebral palsy&quot; was not significantly reduced overall (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78-1.12) but was reduced in the neuroprotection trials subgroup (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.98).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Stillbirth or pediatric death&quot; was not significantly reduced overall (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.92-1.17) or in the neuroprotection trials subgroup (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80-1.12).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Given the concern about competing outcomes, the finding that antenatal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> had no significant effect on the combined outcome of &quot;death or cerebral palsy&quot; in the overall group of trials merits discussion. It is possible that the nonsignificant difference of the combined outcome is due to an increased risk of fetal or infant death in a subgroup of magnesium exposed fetuses, as suggested by two trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. For this reason, some clinicians do not administer magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection, despite the protective effect against cerebral palsy. On the other hand, the combined outcome of &quot;death or cerebral palsy&quot; was reduced significantly when only trials designed specifically to assess the neuroprotective effect of magnesium sulfate were analyzed; we believe this provides significant reassurance that the decrease in occurrence and severity of cerebral palsy is not achieved as a result of an increased risk of death.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1360234858\"><span class=\"h2\">Other short-term outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-term pediatric outcomes other than death and cerebral palsy have also been evaluated by meta-analysis, and no benefit was found in terms of a reduction in risk of blindness, deafness, or developmental delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Importantly, magnesium exposure did not decrease the frequency of adverse effects, such as Apgar score less than seven at five minutes, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, neonatal seizures, or need for ongoing respiratory support. The effect of gestational age at randomization (&lt;30 weeks versus &lt;32 to 34 weeks) did not make a significant difference. (See <a href=\"#H613791988\" class=\"local\">'Gestational age'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2326548072\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes at school-age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only one of the randomized trials discussed above, ACTOMgSO4, reported on long-term outcomes after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The follow-up study included data on 669 children (77 percent of the original study) at a mean age of 8.4 years, corrected for prematurity. The magnesium sulfate and placebo groups had similar rates of cerebral palsy, abnormal motor function, and other neurologic, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes at school age, but magnesium exposure was associated with a trend towards improved survival (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62-1.03). The lack of benefit at school age in this trial does not negate the benefit of magnesium sulfate therapy in decreasing cerebral palsy risk given results of meta-analyses of randomized trials. There are significant differences in patient population and study protocols among three large randomized trials, and thus long-term outcome data from other trials are needed before making definitive conclusions about long-term outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1942955410\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following discussion reflects the authors' approach to use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> for neuroprotection before preterm birth. This approach is based on the evidence cited above and below and is generally consistent with American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

For example, in the Australasian Collaborative Trial of Magnesium Sulfate (ACTOMgSO4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and PREMAG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] trials, 63 to 88 percent of women were in preterm labor. In contrast, in the Beneficial Effects of Antenatal Magnesium Sulfate (BEAM) trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], the majority (85 percent) of women had preterm premature rupture of membranes. The significant heterogeneity among subjects makes it impossible to determine whether fetuses born prematurely due to a specific subtype of preterm birth are more likely to benefit from antenatal magnesium sulfate administration compared with other subtypes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1766268166\"><span class=\"h3\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> is contraindicated in women with myasthenia gravis since it can precipitate a severe myasthenic crisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. It should also be avoided in women with known myocardial compromise or cardiac conduction defects because of its anti-inotropic effects. Since magnesium is eliminated by the kidneys, women with impaired renal function will have an exaggerated rise in serum magnesium concentration and may develop magnesium toxicity at the usual maintenance infusion doses. Maintenance infusion dosing must be adjusted or eliminated in women with renal insufficiency (defined as a serum creatinine greater than 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [88.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]),</span> but a standard loading dose is given since their volume of distribution is not altered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H613791988\"><span class=\"h2\">Gestational age</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110565331\"><span class=\"h3\">Lower limit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women at risk for imminent delivery at the limit of viability (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periviable-birth-limit-of-viability\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periviable birth (Limit of viability)&quot;</a>), we confer with the neonatology team and jointly counsel families about possible management strategies.
