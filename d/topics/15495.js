It usually affects areas with many oil glands. These include the scalp, face, upper chest, and back. Dandruff is a mild type of seborrheic dermatitis.</p><p>Seborrheic dermatitis is common in babies. It is called &quot;cradle cap&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82990\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82990 \">picture 1</a>). Cradle cap can cause redness and greasy yellow scales on the head. It can also cause red patches and greasy scales on the face, diaper area, or other areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18133790\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82991\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82991 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scaly patches on the skin that can look oily or greasy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White scales or flakes on the head or hair &ndash; This is the most common symptom of dandruff (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82992\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82992 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild itching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crusty, yellow material on the eyelashes and eyelid redness</p><p/><p>Stress can make seborrheic dermatitis worse. It often gets worse in winter, when the weather is cold and dry. It can get better in summer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18133805\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for seborrheic dermatitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no one test for seborrheic dermatitis. A doctor or nurse can usually tell if someone has it by doing an exam and asking questions.</p><p>If your doctor is not sure you have seborrheic dermatitis, he or she might do a skin biopsy. In this test, the doctor takes a small sample of skin from an affected area. Another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope to see if it is seborrheic dermatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18133820\"><span class=\"h1\">How is seborrheic dermatitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin creams and ointments &ndash; These can help stop itching and redness. They might contain medicines that kill fungus (called &quot;antifungal medicines&quot;), steroid medicine, or other medicines. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shampoos with antifungal or steroid medicine</p><p/><p/><p>Cradle cap usually goes away on its own. This can take a few weeks or months. If you have questions, ask your baby's doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18133835\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Depending on the type of seborrheic dermatitis, there are different treatments you can try. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using an over-the-counter anti-dandruff shampoo (sample brand names: Selsun, Head and Shoulders). Use it every day until you see less dandruff. After that, use it every other day or twice a week. Leave it on your hair for 5 or 10 minutes. Then rinse your hair, making sure you get all the shampoo out. If your dandruff does not get better after 4 to 6 weeks, try a different anti-dandruff shampoo. If your symptoms get worse, see your doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using an over-the-counter <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydrocortisone</a> cream (sample brand names: Ala-Cort, Cortaid) to help stop redness and itching on the face or body. Use it 1 or 2 times a day until the symptoms get better. If they do not get better after 2 weeks, see a doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p>If your baby has cradle cap, you can try:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Washing the area with baby shampoo and using a soft toothbrush or fine-tooth comb to remove scaly skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting a small amount of oil (such as petroleum jelly, vegetable oil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">mineral oil</a>, or baby oil) on your baby's head to loosen scaly skin. You can leave this on overnight, if needed. Next, brush the baby's scalp gently with a soft brush to remove scales. Then wash the area with regular baby shampoo (not baby shampoo with medicine in it).</p><p/><p>If your baby still has cradle cap after you try these things, talk to your baby's doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18133850\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diaper-rash-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diaper rash (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dermatitis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seborrheic-dermatitis-including-dandruff-and-cradle-cap-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seborrheic dermatitis (including dandruff and cradle cap) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Atopic dermatitis (eczema) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diaper-rash-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diaper rash in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
