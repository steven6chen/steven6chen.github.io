Through the inhibition of neurotransmission between peripheral nerve endings and muscle fibers, botulinum toxin weakens or paralyzes skeletal muscle. Initially used for medical indications, botulinum toxin injection has now become one of the most requested procedures in facial rejuvenation.</p><p>When used appropriately, botulinum toxin injection is an overwhelmingly safe method for improving cosmetic defects that are caused by or exacerbated by muscle contraction, such as prominent glabellar rhytides. The effects of botulinum toxin are transient; muscular function typically returns to baseline within a few months.</p><p>The mechanism of action, formulations, clinical use, and safety of botulinum toxin injections for cosmetic indications will be reviewed here. The use of botulinum toxin for specific cosmetic or medical indications is discussed elsewhere.

Since then, seven serotypes of botulinum toxin (A, B, C1, D, E, F, and G) produced by different strains of the bacterium have been identified. The pharmacologic properties of the serotypes differ, and only serotypes A and B are available for clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Botulinum toxin type A is the most common form of botulinum toxin used in aesthetic clinical practice.</p><p>The clinical utility of botulinum toxin initially became evident in the treatment of strabismus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Subsequently, botulinum toxin has been utilized for a variety of other medical conditions characterized by muscular hyperactivity, including blepharospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], hemifacial spasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], and cervical dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dystonia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dystonia&quot;, section on 'Botulinum toxin injections'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myoclonus#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myoclonus&quot;, section on 'Botulinum toxin injections'</a>.)</p><p>In 1992, we published the first report of the use of botulinum toxin for a cosmetic indication. This report documented the benefit of botulinum toxin type A for the treatment of glabellar frown lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Botulinum toxin is now utilized for multiple cosmetic concerns that can be improved with local muscle relaxation, such as other dynamic rhytides on the upper face and skin lines located on the lower face and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4082356\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical utility of botulinum toxin stems from the ability of the toxin to prevent muscular contraction through inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from peripheral nerve cells into neuromuscular junctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Botulinum toxins are peptides that are composed of one heavy chain and one light chain. After the heavy chain of the injected toxin binds to receptors on the terminal ends of nerve cells, the peptide enters the cytoplasm through endocytosis. Once in the cytoplasm, the light chain cleaves components of SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor), a complex of proteins necessary for the exocytosis of acetylcholine. The sites of cleavage within the SNARE protein complex differ among the serotypes; while botulinum toxin types A, C1, and E cleave SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kd), serotypes B, D, F, and G cleave VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein). VAMP is also known as synaptobrevin.</p><p>As a result of this cleavage, acetylcholine remains in the neuron, where it is unable to bind to receptors on muscle fibers and stimulate muscle contraction (chemodenervation). The inhibitory effect of botulinum toxin is temporary; recovery of muscular function often becomes clinically evident approximately three months after treatment as the neuromuscular junction begins to recover. The development of new collateral nerve ends may be partially responsible for recovery; however, these terminal buds appear to be transient, and recovery of the original nerve terminal eventually occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24777445\"><span class=\"h1\">FORMULATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two serotypes of botulinum toxin have been formulated for clinical use, including botulinum toxin type A (the most common serotype used for cosmetic applications) and botulinum toxin type B. In order to prevent confusion between products, in 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended the use of specific names, rather than serotypes, to refer to the available formulations of botulinum toxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Botulinum toxin is effective for aesthetic concerns that are caused by underlying muscle contraction. Individuals with other signs of aging, such as lentigines, telangiectasias, textural changes, and skin laxity often require additional cosmetic procedures to achieve satisfactory rejuvenation. (See <a href=\"#H4081882\" class=\"local\">'Use as adjunctive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>If the cosmetic defect can be improved with botulinum toxin, and patient characteristics do not indicate that treatment is contraindicated, the patient should then be thoroughly informed about the expected duration of treatment benefit, the need for retreatment, and the potential adverse effects of botulinum toxin injection. Patients who have unrealistic expectations for treatment results are likely to remain dissatisfied regardless of the clinical outcome. We have found that digital photographs, taken both before and after treatment are useful for assessing improvement. (See <a href=\"#H24777599\" class=\"local\">'Side effects and complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Because botulinum toxin weakens or paralyzes muscles, the effect of injections on other bodily functions also must be considered.

Although the package inserts for Botox Cosmetic and Dysport recommend refrigerating these products at 2 to 8&deg;C and then discarding them if they are not used within 24 or 4 hours after reconstitution, respectively, many clinicians refrigerate reconstituted vials for longer periods of time in anticipation of future use.

Clinically significant pain was more likely to occur with 30-gauge needles (40 percent of patients) than with 32-gauge needles (15 percent of patients; odds ratio 3.80, 95% CI 1.05-13.78), suggesting that patients who experience significant pain during facial injection may benefit from use of a smaller-gauge needle.</p><p>In our practice, we typically use a 31-gauge needle for injection. Use of a syringe that lacks a needle hub will minimize product waste.</p><p>The appropriate dose of botulinum toxin is determined by the treatment location and muscle mass; men typically have stronger and larger facial muscles and require higher doses than women. The number of injections and appropriate spacing of injections is dependent on the specific cosmetic defect. Local anatomic landmarks are used to guide the placement of injections.</p><p>Many clinicians, including ourselves, sometimes massage the treatment site after injection in an attempt to spread the toxin, which theoretically could increase the efficacy of treatment. The benefit of this procedure has not been formally studied, and if performed, care should be taken to avoid massaging in a direction that could promote movement of the toxin to untargeted areas. We generally avoid massage for injection sites above the brow due to a concern for inducing brow ptosis. (See <a href=\"#H525807\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites#H4080955\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulinum toxin for cosmetic indications: Treatment of specific sites&quot;, section on 'Horizontal forehead rhytides'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25308488\"><span class=\"h2\">After treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When treating the periorbital region, we apply gentle direct pressure immediately after withdrawal of the needle to reduce the occurrence of bruising. </p><p>Although there is a lack of data to confirm the efficacy of these measures, we and many other clinicians instruct patients to engage in actions that theoretically may minimize excessive diffusion of the toxin to untargeted areas and improve the efficacy of treatment. To minimize excessive spread of the toxin, we instruct patients to remain upright for at least two to four hours after injection and recommend that they avoid pressing or rubbing the treated areas for 24 hours. We also tell patients to contract and relax the treated muscles as much as possible for two to three hours after the procedure. In theory, contracting muscles may facilitate uptake of the toxin by neurons, accelerating the appearance of clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>The manufacturers of Botox Cosmetic, Dysport, and Xeomin recommend that treatments should be spaced by at least three months. However, for patients in whom the response to treatment is unpredictable (patients receiving an initial treatment or a dosing change), we schedule an appointment for reassessment two to three weeks after treatment. If the desired effect has not been achieved, we perform additional injections at that time to improve treatment results; subsequent injections are performed at longer intervals. In patients who have received large doses (eg, greater than 100 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a>), we wait one to two months before administering touch-up injections in an attempt to reduce the risk for immunogenicity.

Side effects are usually mild and transient and most commonly include swelling or bruising at the injection site, mild headache, or flu-like symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Undesired impairment of muscle function may also occur, but is usually associated with poor injection technique or inappropriate patient selection. Because smaller doses are less likely to cause unintended adverse effects, a conservative approach to treatment is advisable. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525807\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffusion of botulinum toxin occasionally results in effects on muscles or glands adjacent to the targeted musculature. Diffusion of toxin in the upper face can result highly undesirable adverse effects that last for 2 to 12 weeks, including brow ptosis (excessive weakening of the frontalis muscle) and eyelid ptosis (weakening of the upper eyelid levator muscle secondary to diffusion into the orbital septum). In addition, a quizzical or &quot;cockeyed&quot; appearance (&quot;Mr. Spock&quot; eyebrow) can result from preferential weakening of the medial frontalis muscles, which allows unaffected lateral muscle fibers of the frontalis to elevate the lateral brow. Other adverse effects that can occur in the upper face include diplopia, ectropion, lower eyelid droop, epiphora (excessive tearing), decreased strength of eye closure, and dry eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p>In the lower face, complications of treatment typically involve effects on muscle function and facial expression. These adverse effects usually are due to the use of excessive doses or injection into inappropriate locations. Flaccid cheek, incompetent mouth, asymmetrical smile, and loss of the ability to whistle are most likely to occur when injections are placed too close to the mouth, injections are performed in the mental fold, or when botulinum toxin interacts with the orbicularis oris muscle. The administration of high doses in the neck area can lead to dysphagia and weakness of the neck flexors.</p><p>Eyelid ptosis can be partially improved with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apraclonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apraclonidine</a> drops given two to three times per day until resolution. This usually results in 1 to 2 mm of eyelid elevation. The quizzical-appearing brow can be remedied through injection of the lateral frontalis musculature. Other functional adverse effects that cannot be improved with compensatory treatment resolve as the effect of botulinum toxin diminishes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24777620\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical safety record</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the available data on botulinum toxin reveals an impressive safety record.

Serious adverse effects reported to the FDA have also been low in number; between 1989 and 2003, only 36 serious adverse effects associated with cosmetic use were reported. Examples of the serious adverse effects that were documented included injection site reactions, headache, focal facial paralysis, muscle weakness, flu-like symptoms, dysphagia, respiratory compromise, cardiac arrhythmia, seizure, ocular abnormalities, and allergic reactions. Of note, 13 of the patients who experienced serious adverse effects had underlying medical conditions that may have contributed to the observed event (eg, respiratory compromise in a patient with asthma and cardiac arrhythmia in a patient with a history of heart murmur).</p><p>Although the risk of serious adverse effects is low with cosmetic use, side effects such as aspiration, dysphagia, pneumonia, anaphylaxis, botulism, and death have been reported in association with the use of botulinum toxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications/abstract/86-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-91</a>].

Through the controlled inhibition of local neurotransmission, botulinum toxin injections improve aesthetic concerns that are caused or exacerbated by muscular contraction. The effect of treatment is temporary; muscle recovery often becomes clinically evident a few months after treatment. (See <a href=\"#H4082356\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanisms of action and clinical properties of botulinum toxin vary according to serotype. Botulinum toxin type A is the primary form of botulinum toxin utilized for cosmetic treatment. Botulinum toxin type B has been less extensively studied for cosmetic indications, but also appears to be effective in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H24777445\" class=\"local\">'Formulations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24777452\" class=\"local\">'Cosmetic use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various formulations of botulinum toxin A are available worldwide. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">OnabotulinumtoxinA</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abobotulinumtoxina-dysport-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abobotulinumtoxinA</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incobotulinumtoxina-xeomin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">incobotulinumtoxinA</a> are the formulations available for clinical use in North America. Few high-quality studies have directly compared the efficacy of different formulations of botulinum toxin. (See <a href=\"#H24777445\" class=\"local\">'Formulations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24777452\" class=\"local\">'Cosmetic use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absolute contraindications to treatment with botulinum toxin include infection at the injection site and hypersensitivity to product components. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abobotulinumtoxina-dysport-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">AbobotulinumtoxinA</a> should <strong>not</strong> be given to patients who are allergic to cow's milk protein. (See <a href=\"#H522661\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful patient selection and patient education, as well as thorough understanding of head and neck anatomy and appropriate injection technique are critical for the achievement of desired results and minimization of adverse effects. Common complications of botulinum toxin injection include transient swelling, bruising, and headache. When administered appropriately, serious adverse effects associated with the use of botulinum toxin for cosmetic indications are rare. (See <a href=\"#H1493835\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24777599\" class=\"local\">'Side effects and complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improper placement of injections or diffusion of the toxin to untargeted areas after injection can result in excessive muscle weakness that can cause temporary disfigurement or functional impairments. Some cosmetic defects such as eyelid ptosis and a quizzical-appearing brow can be improved with therapeutic interventions. In other cases, improvement is dependent upon the diminishing effect of botulinum toxin over time. (See <a href=\"#H24777599\" class=\"local\">'Side effects and complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Botulinum toxin can be used in conjunction with other aesthetic procedures to improve clinical outcomes. Patients undergoing injection of cosmetic fillers, ablative laser resurfacing, microfocused ultrasound, or facial cosmetic surgeries may benefit from the concomitant use of botulinum toxin.
