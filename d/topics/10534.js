These disorders have distinct pathologic and clinical characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74564\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74564 \">table 1</a>), but their pathogenesis remains poorly understood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, epidemiology, and risk factors in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>UC disease activity varies substantially among patients and over time. Among healthcare encounters for children with active UC, approximately 5 percent have acute severe colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some of these cases will be the initial manifestation of UC, while others represent exacerbations or &quot;flares&quot; of the chronic disease. The management of these patients is reviewed here.

Numeric scores are given to symptoms of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, stool consistency, stool frequency, presence of nocturnal stools, and activity level, adding to a maximum score of 85. Of these components, rectal bleeding has the most impact on the score, contributing up to 30 points. PUCAI scores are interpreted as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0 to 9 &ndash; remission</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>10 to 34 &ndash; mild disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>35 to 64 &ndash; moderate disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>65 to 85 &ndash; severe disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349554736\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for infectious colitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infectious etiologies or superimposed infections should be excluded by stool cultures for enteric pathogens and tests for Clostridium difficile toxin. Although most colitis flares are not triggered by pathogenic bacterial infection, and low fevers in UC are generally caused by the colitis itself, between 5 and 25 percent of children presenting with a flare of UC have underlying C. difficile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Details of this evaluation to exclude other causes of colitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children#H9479602\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with steroid-refractory disease (severe colitis that does not respond promptly to intravenous [IV] glucocorticoids), the possibility of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease should be excluded. This should be done by evaluating colonic biopsies for cytomegalic inclusions, and by performing immunohistochemistry tests on intestinal biopsies collected at sigmoidoscopy. Blood testing for CMV is not specific for colonic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Full colonoscopy usually should be avoided in patients with severe colitis because of risks of perforation. Superinfection with CMV is common in adults on chronic glucocorticoid treatment and is associated with a high rate of steroid resistance (40 to 60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Case series in adults suggest that treatment with antiviral agents may be effective for patients with UC and CMV superinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

A higher level of suspicion should be used for patients on glucocorticoids because these drugs may mask the symptoms of toxic megacolon. Toxic megacolon occurs in approximately 5 percent of patients with severe UC and may be triggered by hypokalemia or opiate use. In adults, it is defined as an acute dilatation of the transverse colon to a diameter greater than 5 to 6 cm, with the loss of haustral folds, in a patient with a severe exacerbation of colitis. In children younger than 10 years, a transverse colonic diameter of &gt;4 cm suggests toxic megacolon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

However, most patients do not desire surgery (at least initially), and medical therapy is often successful in achieving and maintaining remission. Patients who have medically unresponsive disease, experience intolerable drug side effects, or are at high risk of developing cancer should be referred for surgery. The outcomes and potential complications of colectomy are summarized below and detailed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"#H349554228\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of ulcerative colitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following discussion outlines treatment of patients with severe colitis (as defined above), or refractory disease (ie, unresponsive to initial medical management with intravenous [IV] glucocorticoids). A consensus statement developed by an international panel of experts makes recommendations regarding medical, surgical, and nutritional management of these children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], but there remains significant variation because of limited clinical evidence to guide treatment decisions.</p><p>Management of patients with mild or moderate disease, or with disease limited to the rectum (proctitis), is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349552899\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with severe disease (pediatric UC activity index [PUCAI] score 65 to 85) typically have profuse bloody diarrhea, abdominal distention or tenderness, and signs of systemic illness (fever, tachycardia, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, leukocytosis). Such patients should be treated emergently with hospitalization and surgical consultation. These patients require fluid and electrolyte management, and often require replacement of blood <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> albumin.</p><p>After blood and stool cultures have been obtained, patients should be given high-dose IV glucocorticoids. Common practice is to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (up to a maximum of 60 mg daily), divided in one or two daily doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>]. There is some evidence that dosing above 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day does not appear to further improve outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Oral 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) preparations are usually stopped at the time of hospital admission because 5-ASA preparations are usually ineffective in acute severe exacerbations of colitis and are responsible for worsening colitis in approximately 3 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylates in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on '5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)'</a>.)</p><p>Antibiotics are indicated in cases of suspected bacteremia, C. difficile infection, and toxic megacolon, and are continued until blood and stool cultures are negative. Some clinicians also utilize systemic antibiotic therapy empirically in the treatment of colitis flares, but this is based on limited evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antibiotics for treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases&quot;, section on 'Ulcerative colitis'</a>.)</p><p>If patients with a severe colitis flare can tolerate feeding, continuation of regular diet is appropriate; bowel rest tends to reduce stool volume but does not affect disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, many patients have severe pain when they eat or cannot take in adequate calories. In these children, parenteral nutrition is required until clinical improvement allows for enteral feeding or until the patient goes to surgery. Enteral nutrition also should be stopped if toxic megacolon is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H349554987\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for toxic megacolon'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349553101\"><span class=\"h2\">Refractory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who do not have a clinically meaningful response to a 7- to 10-day course of IV glucocorticoids are considered to have steroid-refractory disease, constituting about 30 to 40 percent of pediatric patients with severe colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>]. </p><p>Patients who fail to have meaningful improvement by day three to five of IV glucocorticoids are likely to have steroid-refractory disease. This was demonstrated in a prospective study in which a PUCAI score &lt;45 on day three of IV glucocorticoids was a good predictor of steroid treatment success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Furthermore, a PUCAI score &gt;70 on day five of IV glucocorticoids was a strong predictor of steroid treatment failure (specificity and positive predictive value [PPV] 100 percent). These findings suggest that lack of early response to steroid treatment warrants a discussion of, and preparation for, second-line therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, concomitant infection should be excluded, including assessment for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection via sigmoidoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H349554736\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for infectious colitis'</a> above.) </p><p>Second-line treatment options include surgical colectomy or a trial of medical therapy. We suggest presenting surgery as an important option at this stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] (see <a href=\"#H349554228\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below). For patients who are reluctant to undergo colectomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> need more time to make the decision about surgery, medical therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">infliximab</a> or calcineurin inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tacrolimus</a>) can be offered. This second-line therapy is sometimes known as &quot;rescue&quot; or &quot;salvage&quot; therapy. The limited data available suggest that these drugs induce remission in approximately 75 percent of children with acute severe colitis, but that most patients ultimately require colectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

A review of six pediatric case series reported a pooled short-term response rate of 75 percent, and one-year response rate of 64 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. A multicenter study in 60 children found a similar short-term response rate (73 percent at eight weeks) but a long-term remission rate at 54 weeks of only 29 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The authors of this study also noted, however, that &quot;stepping up&quot; therapy, by either increasing the dose or decreasing the time between infusions, could improve response rates in a subset of nonresponders. Infliximab appears to modestly reduce the likelihood of colectomy and overall use of glucocorticoids. In a retrospective multicenter study, 45 children treated with infliximab for UC had a cumulative risk of colectomy of 21 percent within one year, and 26 percent within two years; the likelihood of requiring concomitant glucocorticoid treatment was 32 percent within one year, and 48 percent within two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Oral microemulsion (or &quot;modified&quot;) cyclosporine also may be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The conversion from IV to oral microemulsion is approximately 1:3 for the total daily dose (divided in two doses for the oral form), but drug levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted further as needed. Only a few small trials have addressed the use of cyclosporine in children with UC, with outcomes similar to those seen in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H349553101\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urgent colectomy is indicated for patients with uncontrolled hemorrhage, or complications such as toxic megacolon or bowel perforation. We also suggest colectomy for patients with severe disease (PUCAI &gt;65) who continue to deteriorate or do not improve during a one- to two-week period of glucocorticoid treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Colectomy also is indicated in patients who cannot be weaned from glucocorticoids, who experience unwanted side effects (eg, growth failure from steroids), or those who fail medical &quot;rescue&quot; therapy.
