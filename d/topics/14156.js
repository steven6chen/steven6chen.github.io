While patients with cancer are similar in many ways to those without cancer, the direct and indirect (systemic) effects of the cancer and the side effects of cancer therapy can influence perioperative evaluation and management. Here we will provide an overview of issues that are relevant to patients with current or past cancer. General preoperative evaluation and estimation of cardiac risk from surgery are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The preoperative medical evaluation of cancer patients should include an assessment of nutritional status, functional status, and symptom control (particularly regarding cancer-related pain) in addition to an assessment of general medical issues. The natural history of the cancer and effects of any prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy should also be considered. The short- and long-term outcomes of cancer surgery in older patients can be equivalent to those in younger patients. Treatment considerations should be based on functional status, not on chronological age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-patients-with-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The timing and purpose of the cancer surgery can affect perioperative evaluation. While rarely emergent, cancer surgery is usually not elective, and therefore the amount of time available to medically optimize a patient may be limited.</p><p>There is growing recognition that a patient&rsquo;s physiologic fitness for surgery plays a role in reducing perioperative complications. Patients with cancer tend to be deconditioned due to numerous factors. In this situation, where patients are taking numerous insults to their overall functional status, it may be beneficial to enroll patients into a prehabilitation program as soon as a cancer diagnosis is made (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113780\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113780 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In addition to managing coexisting medical conditions, the internist may also play an important role in coordinating the many complex levels of care provided by surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cancer may become significantly malnourished for a variety of reasons. Eating and drinking can be impaired by pain, nausea, stomatitis, or tumors involving the oropharynx or gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, metabolic aberrations may induce anorexia and weight loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and assessment of cancer cachexia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The indiscriminate use of enteral or parenteral nutrition is not indicated in well-nourished patients or those with mild malnutrition. Although many studies have failed to demonstrate a survival benefit from preoperative nutritional support in patients undergoing cancer surgery, some have found fewer operative complications and a shorter length of hospital stay in severely malnourished patients receiving nutritional support prior to major surgery for cancers of the digestive tract and the head and neck. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of parenteral and enteral/oral nutritional support in patients with cancer&quot;, section on 'The perioperative setting'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, preoperative nutritional support for cancer patients is reasonable in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seven to 10 days of preoperative parenteral nutritional support for severely malnourished cancer patients prior to major visceral surgery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One to two weeks of enteral nutritional support via a gastrostomy or jejunostomy feeding tube for severely malnourished patients prior to major head and neck cancer surgery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cancer often require medication for pain control. Those who have been receiving opioid analgesics can be expected to have some degree of tolerance and may require dose escalation in the postoperative period to attain adequate pain control. Many patients will be receiving long-acting forms of opioids and may require conversion to short-acting forms of analgesia in the perioperative period. Conversion tables are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111216\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111216 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As in other surgical patients, medications used for pain control in patients with cancer can have important side effects. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause bleeding, gastritis, and impaired renal function, and opioids can cause nausea, constipation, sedation, and delirium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of side effects in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>NSAIDs may be contraindicated in patients with thrombocytopenia from cancer or its treatment, and in patients with impaired renal function. Selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>) do not increase nongastrointestinal bleeding risk, but as with other NSAIDs, they do increase the risk of renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of selective COX-2 inhibitors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-use-of-acetaminophen-and-nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: Use of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients may have concerns about postoperative pain control.

Metastases to the pericardium can cause effusions, tamponade, and constrictive pericarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pericardial disease associated with malignancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiation therapy to the mediastinum can also cause constrictive pericarditis or effusions with or without tamponade. Pericarditis can present months to years after radiation treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-patients-with-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Echocardiography should be performed if physical examination reveals findings consistent with tamponade or constriction (eg, hypotension, jugular venous distension, narrowed pulse pressure, distant heart sounds, or excessive respiratory variation in blood pressure) or if electrocardiography or imaging suggests a significant pericardial effusion.</p><p>Tamponade and constrictive pericarditis must be treated prior to surgery whenever possible. Patients with asymptomatic malignant pericardial effusions should be carefully monitored for the development of tamponade in the perioperative period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary, electrical, and valvular heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy to fields that include the heart can lead to premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Radiation to the heart may also be associated with conduction abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-patients-with-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Therefore, younger patients who might not otherwise be expected to be at risk for CHD, but who have a history of thoracic radiation therapy for cancer, should be assessed for symptomatic CHD as part of the preoperative history and review of systems, and should have a preoperative screening ECG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of radiation therapy for breast cancer and other malignancies&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Radiation therapy has also been associated with valvular heart disease, particularly of the mitral and aortic valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-patients-with-cancer/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]; therefore, careful cardiac auscultation is an important part of the preoperative examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies#H3901072069\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma and pediatric malignancies&quot;, section on 'Valvular disease'</a>.)</p><p>However, antibiotic endocarditis prophylaxis is not necessarily indicated. The 2007 American Heart Association guideline for the prevention of infective endocarditis (which was updated in 2008) narrowed the indications for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis, compared with prior versions, in recognition of the absence of strong supportive evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-patients-with-cancer/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is not indicated unless the patient has a history of endocarditis. Year 2015 guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology are largely in agreement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-patients-with-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Pre-existing heart disease, radiation therapy, and exposure to other chemotherapeutic agents (eg, taxanes, trastuzumab) can lower the cumulative anthracycline dose threshold at which cardiomyopathy develops. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, monitoring, and diagnosis of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of anthracycline cardiotoxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-nonanthracycline-cancer-chemotherapy-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of nonanthracycline cancer chemotherapy agents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-trastuzumab-and-other-her2-targeted-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab and other HER2-targeted agents&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Electrocardiographic abnormalities such as sinus tachycardia, premature atrial or ventricular contractions, nonspecific ST and T wave changes, and low-voltage QRS complexes may be early signs of cardiotoxicity, but are insensitive indicators of myocardial dysfunction. Assessment of left ventricular function before surgery should be considered in patients who are at risk for cardiomyopathy since they are at increased risk for heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-patients-with-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Follow-up screening guidelines for childhood cancer survivors at risk for treatment-related heart failure are available from the Children&rsquo;s Oncology group and discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Therefore, the preoperative evaluation of a patient with an anterior or middle mediastinal mass should include a detailed review for respiratory symptoms including stridor, dyspnea, wheezing, and orthopnea, and examination for evidence of neck or chest vein engorgement or swelling restricted to the face and neck. Imaging of the chest with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography should be performed to look for central airway, cardiac, or vascular compression. Flow volume loops should also be obtained to look for central airway compromise.

Thus, for patients in whom concomitant splenectomy is anticipated (eg, during resection of a distal pancreatic cancer), patients should undergo appropriately timed preoperative immunization against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> (pneumococcus), <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> (meningococcus), and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b. If vaccination was not possible prior to surgery, or unanticipated splenectomy was performed, the patient should be vaccinated postoperatively. Vaccination recommendations for asplenic patients are presented elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91885\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91885 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;, section on 'Timing of immunizations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgical risk for most cancer patients is comparable to that of patients without cancer, and should be managed similarly. However, the following should be considered in the preoperative evaluation of patients with cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimize nutritional status prior to surgery. Consider supplemental enteral or parental nutrition for severely malnourished patients. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Address postoperative pain control during the preoperative evaluation of patients who chronically take opioids, because these patients are likely to require greater than usual doses of medication for postoperative pain control. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have received radiation therapy to fields that include the heart are at increased risk for premature coronary artery disease, cardiac conduction disease, and valvular heart disease. Screen these patients for heart disease clinically and with a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Obtain additional cardiac testing if indicated. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular status'</a> above.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have received anthracycline or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> chemotherapy are at increased risk for heart failure. Screen these patients for heart failure clinically and with a 12-lead ECG. Obtain additional cardiac testing if indicated. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac toxicity from chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several chemotherapy drugs are associated with prolongation in the QT interval, which may increase risk for potentially fatal arrhythmias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 2</a>). Correction of electrolyte abnormalities and avoidance of other QT prolonging drugs or strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be considered in patients who are already taking a QT prolonging drug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Closely monitor patients with asymptomatic malignant pericardial effusions for the development of tamponade in the perioperative period. Treat symptomatic effusions, cardiac tamponade, or constrictive pericarditis prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pericardial disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mass lesions that could compromise the upper central airway are at increased risk for perioperative respiratory failure. Before surgery, assess the airways of these patients with laryngoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cardiopulmonary mass effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with a mediastinal mass are also at increased risk for perioperative cardiopulmonary failure. Before surgery, obtain chest computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), echocardiography, and flow-volume loop measurements. Those with evidence of cardiac, vascular, or airway compression require special perioperative management. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cardiopulmonary mass effects'</a> above.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bleomycin</a> can cause lung damage, and treatment with supplemental inhaled oxygen several years after bleomycin therapy can also cause lung damage. Before surgery, carefully assess the pulmonary function of patients who have ever received bleomycin, and minimize the use of supplemental inhaled oxygen and IV fluids both during and after surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If time and facilities permit, assess patients at risk for adrenal insufficiency with measurement of an early morning serum cortisol concentration or with an adrenocorticotropin stimulation test. Otherwise, consider treating high-risk patients with empiric perioperative stress-dose glucocorticoid. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Adrenal insufficiency'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The management of the surgical patient taking glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measure serum thyroid stimulating hormone and free T4 concentrations in patients who have ever received neck radiation therapy or who have received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> for more than a few weeks. Correct hypothyroidism prior to surgery. Maintain a high clinical index of suspicion for radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis. (See <a href=\"#H1155047\" class=\"local\">'Stroke risk in patients undergoing neck irradiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before surgery, screen all patients who have systemic malignancy with serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, and calcium concentrations, and with a complete blood count. Preoperative hyponatremia is associated with worse outcomes; the best approach is to identify the underlying impairment(s), avoid exacerbating the hyponatremia with hypotonic intravenous solutions, and closely monitor and carefully manage the patient in the postoperative period. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Hyponatremia'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When feasible, postpone surgery to allow recovery from chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Neutropenia and lymphopenia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some form of preoperative pharmacologic preparation is indicated for all patients with catecholamine-secreting neoplasms such as well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract (carcinoids) or <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma</span>. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Carcinoid crisis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reactivation of viral hepatitis (particularly hepatitis B [HBV]) is a potential complication of myelosuppressive chemotherapy, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofatumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofatumumab</a>. Patients who are positive for HBV surface antigen or for antibodies against HBV core antigen should have liver biochemical tests measured prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Hepatotoxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired wound healing is a well-described complication of certain chemotherapy agents, particularly antiangiogenic agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor. At least 28 days (preferably six to eight weeks) should elapse between a dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> and major surgery when feasible. Orally-active small molecular antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be stopped at least one week before surgery. (See <a href=\"#H516755298\" class=\"local\">'Wound healing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom concomitant splenectomy is anticipated (eg, resection of a distal pancreatic cancer), preoperative immunization against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> (pneumococcus), <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> (meningococcus), and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b is indicated.
