The central portion is thickest and attaches to the medial process of the tuberosity of the calcaneus; distally, it divides into five slips, one for each toe. The plantar fascia provides support; as the toes extend during the stance phase of gait, it is tightened by a windlass mechanism, resulting in elevation of the longitudinal arch, in inversion of the hindfoot, and in a resultant external rotation of the leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23254794\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common causes of foot pain in adults, estimated to be responsible for about one million patient visits to the doctor per year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The peak incidence occurs between ages 40 and 60 years in the general population, with a younger peak in runners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It may be bilateral in up to one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology is poorly understood and is probably multifactorial. Possible risk factors for the development of plantar fasciitis include obesity, prolonged standing or jumping, flat feet, and reduced ankle dorsiflexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/4,6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-10</a>]. Although heel spurs often coexist with plantar fasciitis, it is unclear whether they have a causal role and may instead represent a secondary response to an inflammatory reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/3,7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,11</a>]. One study that assessed presence of foot pain in 137 people with heel spurs compared with age- and sex-matched people without heel spurs found an association between heel spurs and increased body mass index, diabetes, and lower-limb osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. People with heel spurs had a higher prevalence of foot pain, but the prevalence of plantar fasciitis was similar in both groups.</p><p>There is a high incidence in runners, suggesting that plantar fasciitis, at least in this population, is due to an injury caused by repetitive microtrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this group, the following have been proposed as risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive training (particularly a sudden increase in the distance run)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Faulty running shoes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Running on unyielding surfaces (including some synthetic running tracks)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flat feet (pes planus or pronated ankles)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited ankle dorsiflexion (eg, due to a shortened Achilles tendon)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pes cavus (high-arched) foot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged walking or standing on hard surfaces</p><p/><p>However, high-quality evidence of an association for most of these factors is limited or absent.</p><p>Plantar fasciitis is common among ballet dancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and among those performing dance aerobic exercise. Stress applied to the Achilles tendon, due either to muscle contraction or to passive stretching, results in increased tension in the plantar fascia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Decreased knee extension, as may occur with tight hamstring muscles, causes an increase in loading of the forefoot when walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]; this could, in turn, increase the stress on the plantar fascia.</p><p>Plantar fasciitis usually occurs as an isolated problem but may be associated with systemic rheumatic diseases, particularly reactive arthritis and the spondyloarthritides. Plantar fasciitis has been reported in association with fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] and with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoride</a> used for the treatment of osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and it may be the presenting symptom in patients with nutritional osteomalacia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The site of abnormality is typically near the origin of the plantar fascia at the medial tuberosity of the calcaneum. Specimens of plantar fascia obtained during surgery for plantar fasciitis reveal a spectrum of changes, ranging from degeneration of the fibrous tissue to fibroblastic proliferation, with or without evidence of chronic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS, EVALUATION, AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of plantar fasciitis is based upon a history of pain in the inferior heel that is worse when initiating walking plus the finding of local point tenderness:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients often describe heel pain that is worse with their first steps in the morning or after a period of inactivity. The pain typically lessens with gradually increased activity, but worsens toward the end of the day with prolonged weight bearing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenderness is best elicited by the examiner dorsiflexing the patient's toes with one hand in order to pull the plantar fascia taut, and then palpating with the thumb or index finger of the other hand along the fascia from the heel to the forefoot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76161\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76161 \">picture 1</a>). Points of discrete tenderness can be found and marked for possible later injection.</p><p/><p>Laboratory testing is not helpful in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. Tests for inflammation (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) will be normal unless there is coexistent inflammatory disease.</p><p>Radiographic studies are not indicated for the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis, but may be required to rule out alternative causes if symptoms persist after initial management. Plain radiographs including lateral and axial views may be helpful in identifying calcaneal stress fractures. The presence of heel spurs is of no diagnostic value in either ruling in or ruling out plantar fasciitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58778\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58778 \">image 1</a>). In one study, 85 percent of 27 patients with plantar fasciitis and 46 percent of 79 controls had calcaneal spurs detected on plain non-weightbearing lateral x-rays read by a radiologist blinded to the clinical diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. On the other hand, increased plantar fascia thickness and fat pad abnormalities detected in the same x-rays had a sensitivity of 85 percent and a specificity of 95 percent for plantar fasciitis.</p><p>The soft tissue may be evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in cases resistant to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Features suggestive of plantar fasciitis are thickening of the plantar fascia and increased signal on delayed (T2) and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Technetium scintigraphy has also been successful in localizing the inflammatory focus and in ruling out stress fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Ultrasonography of the foot may also be useful in detecting plantar fascial thickening, hypoechogenicity at the insertion upon the calcaneus, blurring of the boundary between fascia and surrounding tissues, and decreased echogenicity suggestive of edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96849\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96849 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis were 80 percent and 88.5 percent, respectively, in a study of 77 patients and a similar number of asymptomatic controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Doppler ultrasound may improve the value of this technique and may provide additional information on local hyperemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, the diagnostic utility of ultrasound for plantar fasciitis is unproven and is not recommended for routine use.</p><p>Instructional videos demonstrating proper performance of the ultrasound examination of the foot and related pathology can be found at the website of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine: <a href=\"https://www.amssm.org/TestingDetails.php?IDtest=71&amp;token=+CjrhIBVW0jZK35njTvgceBoc89/qjKZO3f/yKxTQKSohmLSi4ETNC5L3Quc15hVEayAEC/hffGOn8Gr7B9YGA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7762\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">plantar foot ultrasound examination</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amssm.org/TestingDetails.php?IDtest=84&amp;token=+CjrhIBVW0jZK35njTvgceBoc89/qjKZO3f/yKxTQKSohmLSi4ETNC5L3Quc15hV7XGXvUicrr8JaSgWv1coQw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7762\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">sports ultrasound ankle-foot pathology</a>.

These include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108148060\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic causes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nerve entrapment or compression syndromes</strong> &ndash; Entrapment of the posterior tibial nerve (tarsal tunnel syndrome) as it courses beneath the medial malleolus can cause pain, paresthesia, and numbness on the sole of the foot. Percussion tenderness over the posterior tibial nerve in the tarsal tunnel is characteristically found (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Tarsal tunnel syndrome'</a>). Compression or trauma to branches of the posterior tibial nerve, particularly the medial calcaneal branch, can lead to medial and plantar burning pain. Compression of the nerve to abductor digiti quinti can also cause burning pain in the heel.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neuropathic pain</strong> &ndash; Patients with peripheral neuropathy are more likely to have a history of diabetes or alcohol abuse and generally report diffuse foot pain with nocturnal symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>S1 radiculopathy</strong> &ndash; Patients with lumbar spine disorders may have weakness of plantar flexion (gastrocnemius muscle) and pain radiating down the posterior aspect of the leg to the heel. Absent or reduced ankle reflex is typical.

Stress fractures should be considered if there has been an increase in physical activity. While plain radiographs may be diagnostic, early changes are better differentiated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Calcaneal fractures can lead to long-term disability but are relatively uncommon. Axial loading of the foot following a fall from a height is the most common mechanism for severe calcaneal fractures.

An elevated serum alkaline phosphatase may also be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Paget disease of bone&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Haglund's syndrome</strong> &ndash; A prominent, enlarged, bony, posterior-superior calcaneal tubercle sometimes causes compression of soft tissue and foot pain (which may be due, in part, to a retrocalcaneal bursitis) in the posterior area of the heel over the bony prominence, above the site of attachment of the Achilles tendon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Patients with this syndrome, termed Haglund's syndrome or posterior calcaneal tubercle impingement syndrome, may report discomfort when wearing shoes and may have a palpable 2 to 3 mm bony extrusion with an area of erythema and swelling of the overlying skin.

Surgical excision may be considered if the exostosis is large and if symptoms persist, but recovery time may be prolonged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108148078\"><span class=\"h2\">Soft tissue causes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Achilles tendinopathy</strong> &ndash; Disorders of the Achilles tendon typically produce posterior heel pain.

Palpation reveals bony prominence without the padding usually afforded by subcutaneous fat. Unlike pain due to plantar fasciitis, pain due to atrophy of the heel pad is absent in the morning, and it develops and worsens during weightbearing throughout the day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bursitis </strong>&ndash; Retrocalcaneal bursitis may cause localized swelling and erythema of the posterior heel.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Painful heel pad syndrome</strong> &ndash; The painful heel pad syndrome occurs most often in marathon runners. It is thought to result from disruption of the fibrous septae that compartmentalize the fat in the heel pad. Pain is localized to the heel pad. The plantar fascia is not tender, and pain is not accentuated as the examiner dorsiflexes the toes. Insertion of heel cups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] and &quot;Plastazote&quot; that is individually molded to the patient's heel may be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Examination of the affected foot may reveal a loss of height of the arch. There may be visible swelling, or ecchymosis may be present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Piezogenic papules</strong> &ndash; Piezogenic papules are herniations of fat that occur as painful papules at the medial inferior border of the heel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F93204\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93204 \">picture 2</a>). They may be noted only upon weightbearing and are an uncommon cause of painful heels.

Ultrasound therapy, ice massage, and deep friction massage may be used prior to exercise, although their effectiveness is unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tape support of the affected plantar surface, a technique referred to as low-Dye taping, may be beneficial to some patients particularly for first-step pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. Four strips of tape are applied in a specific fashion to provide such support (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70684\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70684 \">picture 9</a>). The tape should not be applied too tightly, and use of hypoallergenic tape is recommended to avoid allergic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p>If these inexpensive and noninvasive measures fail to bring about improvement, a trial of a glucocorticoid injection may be of benefit if significant pain and disability persist for more than three to four weeks.</p><p>The points of tenderness along the plantar fascia may be injected with a glucocorticoid and local anesthetic mixture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F111078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111078 \">figure 3</a>). Glucocorticoid injections provide short-term pain relief. In a randomized trial involving 106 patients, significantly less pain was noted in patients who received a single injection of 1 mL each of glucocorticoid and local anesthetic (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>) than in those who received an injection of 2 mL of local anesthetic alone, a difference that was significant at one month but not at three or six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial including 65 patients, significantly less pain was noted in patients who received a single injection of 0.5 mL (20 mg) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> acetate and 0.5 mL of 0.9% saline via either palpation- or ultrasound-guided injection compared with patients who received placebo injection, and these benefits were maintained to 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In one non-randomized trial in which four types of injections were compared (25 consecutive patients in each group), those who received glucocorticoid (2 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a>) either as a single injection or using a peppering technique were reported to have better outcomes than those who received either 2 mL autologous blood or 2 mL lidocaine using a peppering technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>An alternative and possibly less painful approach, a medial injection, may also provide significant benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. While the author uses a single injection directed to the site of maximal tenderness, other approaches include injections into more than one tender location along the fascia. There is moderate-quality evidence that use of ultrasound to guide placement of the injection does not improve pain more than palpation-guided injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Instructional videos demonstrating proper performance of the ultrasound-guided interventional procedures of the foot can be found at the website of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (<a href=\"https://www.amssm.org/TestingDetails.php?IDtest=76&amp;token=+CjrhIBVW0jZK35njTvgceBoc89/qjKZO3f/yKxTQKSohmLSi4ETNC5L3Quc15hV0YhTJYvL01endFIOC/u0Ug==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7762\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ultrasound-guided interventional procedures of the ankle and foot</a>).

It may also predispose to plantar fascia rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>], although evidence for this is limited and nonconclusive. One study reported a series of 37 patients with a presumptive diagnosis of plantar fascia rupture, all of whom had had a prior episode of plantar fasciitis treated with glucocorticoid injection into the calcaneal origin of the fascia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In another study of 765 patients with plantar fasciitis, 43 of 51 patients with plantar fascia rupture had received one or more glucocorticoid injections, although the number of patients without plantar fascial rupture who received one or more glucocorticoid injections was not reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Other potential measures include custom orthotics or a trial of iontophoresis therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Custom-fabricated inserts, usually provided by podiatrists, include inserted orthoses with foam-rubber raised arches and rubber or tub heels, as well as molded ankle-foot orthoses. A Cochrane systematic review that identified five trials including 691 participants that assessed the use of custom-made foot orthoses for plantar fasciitis was inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Comparators varied across trials and included sham orthoses, no treatment, non-custom foot orthoses, night splints, and a combination of manipulation, mobilization, and stretching; all trials were judged to be at high risk of bias. All but one trial reported comparable outcomes between treatment groups. One trial found better functional outcomes but comparable pain relief with use of custom-made foot orthoses compared with sham orthoses at 3 and 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. A subsequent randomized trial with 77 participants found no between-group differences in morning pain, function, or quality of life between a custom, prefabricated, or sham orthotic at one and three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The efficacy of foot orthoses remains controversial, and there are considerable variations in the prescribing habits of podiatrists, orthopedists, and prosthetists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/72,73,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73,75</a>]. Any potential advantage of customized orthotics over prefabricated ones must be weighed against a substantial difference in cost, estimated to be approximately twofold to sixfold more for the customized version [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. A short walking cast is used by some orthopedists, though, again, there are no published trials of this treatment approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iontophoresis with 0.4 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (six sessions over two weeks) provided moderate initial relief of plantar pain in a small, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in runners with plantar fasciitis, although this effect was not maintained at four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In another small study, low-Dye taping combined with iontophoresis with a 5 percent solution of acetic acid was superior to taping and iontophoresis with 0.4 percent dexamethasone, but was comparable in benefit to taping and iontophoresis with placebo (in place of either acetic acid or dexamethasone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18949868\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistant disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients with plantar fasciitis will improve without surgery. It is generally considered a last line of therapy, and is reserved for those patients who do not respond to at least 6 to 12 months of nonoperative therapy. It is estimated that 2 to 5 percent of patients with plantar fasciitis undergo surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/3,5,13,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,13,78</a>], although the rate may be much lower. As an example, a report of the surgical experience at the Mayo Clinic found that only 16 operations had been performed during a 12-year study period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Combining release of the plantar fascia and the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve may enhance results. In one series of 28 patients (33 feet), over 90 percent of patients had a good outcome and would recommend the procedure to others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>While numerous surgical procedures have been described, none have been assessed in controlled trials. Favorable outcomes are reported in more than 75 percent of published case series, although recovery time may be prolonged and persistent pain is not uncommon. Variations of open or closed, partial or complete, plantar fascia release with or without calcaneal spur resection, excision of abnormal tissue, and nerve decompression have been described.</p><p>In comparison with open-release, closed procedures may allow more rapid recovery and resumption of usual activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. In an uncontrolled series of 16 runners and 10 walkers with refractory plantar fasciitis, uniportal plantar fasciotomy gave good or excellent results, provided that the patient's body mass index was less than 27 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Runners in this series required a mean of 2.6 months before returning to jogging.</p><p>Potential complications of surgery include transient heel pad swelling, calcaneal fracture, injury to the posterior tibial nerve or its branches, and flattening of the longitudinal arch with resultant midtarsal pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43544846\"><span class=\"h2\">Unproven treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several approaches that may be helpful in patients without sufficient improvement from initial measures. However, these approaches are generally more costly and are of uncertain benefit. ESWT has been more extensively studied than any other single treatment modality. Based upon randomized controlled trials, there is high-quality evidence that it is ineffective in treating plantar fasciitis. Other treatments in this section show early promise, but are of uncertain benefit. We feel that ESWT should not be used in routine care. Other treatments should also not be used in routine care until there is evidence of their effectiveness and safety based upon high-quality randomized controlled trials. Unproven treatments include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy</strong> &ndash; A systematic review published in 2005 included 11 trials and performed a pooled analysis of data from six trials involving 897 participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. The authors concluded that there was no clinically important benefit of shock wave therapy, despite a small statistically significant benefit in morning pain of less than 0.5 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. Further, no statistically significant benefit was observed in a sensitivity analysis that only included studies at low risk of bias. Subsequent systematic reviews have included additional trials and concluded that shock wave therapy is more effective than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]. However, these reviews overestimated benefits of shock wave therapy due to omission of high-quality trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> errors in data extraction and data analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Revised pooled estimates from one of the aforementioned systematic reviews that corrected for errors in data extraction no longer demonstrated a benefit of shock wave therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. One open trial reported that outcomes from shock wave treatment were inferior to glucocorticoid injection in people with acute symptoms (&lt;6 weeks' duration) up to 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>] A randomized placebo-controlled trial including 250 patients reported superior outcomes of focused shock wave therapy in terms of percentage change in pain from baseline and mean scores on the Roles and Maudsley scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. However no raw data were provided to verify that the differences were of clinical importance, and the validity of use of the Roles and Maudsley four-point categorical scale for plantar fasciitis and its analysis as a continuous measure was not reported. Success of blinding was also not reported. The major reported adverse effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy is transient pain at the time of treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autologous whole blood or platelet-rich plasma injections </strong>&ndash; Injection of autologous whole blood has been proposed as a treatment for plantar fasciitis on the basis that it contains various growth factors that may begin a cascade of local factors to stimulate angiogenesis and healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. While no trials have assessed the efficacy of autologous blood injection compared with placebo for plantar fasciitis, two trials have compared this treatment with glucocorticoid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/66,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,91</a>]. While participants improved over time irrespective of treatment received, both trials reported significant differences in benefit favoring the glucocorticoid groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/66,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,91</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Autologous platelet-rich plasma injections are an adaptation of autologous whole blood injections. Whole blood is centrifuged to a concentrated state and is injected into the plantar fascia. One three-arm randomized trial involving 75 participants reported that autologous platelet-rich plasma injection was significantly more effective than placebo in relieving pain and improving the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Score and was of similar efficacy to glucocorticoid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. However, mean between-group differences were not reported and the placebo group failed to improve over time, which is out of keeping with the natural history of the condition. One small randomized trial that compared autologous platelet-rich plasma injection with glucocorticoid injection also reported similar efficacy of these two therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>], while one small trial involving 40 patients that did not blind participants reported superior results with platelet-rich plasma injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

Its effectiveness has not been assessed in randomized placebo-controlled trials, and whether there is a long-term increased risk of carcinogenesis is unknown.

The central portion is thickest and attaches to the medial process of the tuberosity of the calcaneus; distally, it divides into five slips, one for each toe. (See <a href=\"#H2128377\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plantar fasciitis, characterized by pain in the plantar region of the foot that is worse when initiating walking, is one of the most common causes of foot and heel pain in adults. The peak incidence occurs between ages 40 and 60 years in the general population, with a younger peak in runners. It may be bilateral in up to one-third of cases. (See <a href=\"#H23254794\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology is poorly understood and is probably multifactorial. Possible risk factors include obesity, prolonged standing or jumping, flat feet, and reduced ankle dorsiflexion. Plantar fasciitis usually occurs as an isolated problem but may be associated with systemic rheumatic diseases, particularly reactive arthritis and the spondyloarthritides. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of plantar fasciitis is based upon a history of pain in the inferior heel that is worse when initiating walking, plus the finding of local point tenderness (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients often describe heel pain that is worse with their first steps in the morning or after a period of inactivity. The pain typically lessens with gradually increased activity but worsens toward the end of the day with prolonged weight bearing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tenderness is best elicited by the examiner dorsiflexing the patient's toes with one hand in order to pull the plantar fascia taut, and then palpating with the thumb or index finger of the other hand along the fascia from the heel to the forefoot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76161\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76161 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For initial therapy, we generally take the following measures (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Performing of stretching exercises for the plantar fascia and calf muscles, which the patient can do at home</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoiding the use of flat shoes and barefoot walking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Using prefabricated, over-the-counter, silicone heel shoe inserts (arch supports <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heel cups)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreasing physical activities that may be causative or aggravating (eg, excessive running, dancing, or jumping)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prescribing a short-term trial (two to three weeks) of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients in whom significant pain and disability persists despite the use of conservative measures for three to four weeks, we suggest a single glucocorticoid injection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients in whom the treatments above have not produced sufficient improvement, we occasionally prescribe molded shoe inserts (orthotics), night splints, and immobilization in a cushioned walking boot (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above). We do not use other interventions such as extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) and autologous whole blood or platelet-rich plasma injections, which are costly and of unproven benefit. (See <a href=\"#H43544846\" class=\"local\">'Unproven treatments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vast majority of patients with plantar fasciitis will improve with only conservative therapy. Surgery is rarely needed, but is an option for patients who do not respond adequately to at least 6 to 12 months of nonoperative therapy. (See <a href=\"#H18949868\" class=\"local\">'Resistant disease'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, 2nd, Greene WB (Ed), American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont 2001. p.487.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plantar-fasciitis/abstract/2\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Riddle DL, Schappert SM.
