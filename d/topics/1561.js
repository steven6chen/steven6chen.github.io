Interpretation of microarray data is complicated by the presence of both novel and recurrent copy-number variants of unknown significance. Nonetheless, CMA has the highest detection rate among clinically available genetic tests for patients with ASD (excluding whole-exome sequencing, which may be costly and not yet widely available) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-diagnosis/abstract/50-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-55</a>].

Among the 95 children who underwent both CMA and whole-exome sequencing, the yield of whole-exome sequencing was similar to that of CMA (8.4 percent) and the combined yield of CMA and whole-exome sequencing was 15.8 percent. Molecular diagnosis was achieved more often in children with more severe dysmorphology, suggesting that it may be possible to identify children with the greatest likelihood of genetic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].
