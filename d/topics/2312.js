Argon gas (also known as argon plasma) is expelled from a probe and then a high-voltage electric current is passed along the probe. When the electric current contacts the argon gas, it becomes ionized and conducts a monopolar electric current that &quot;grounds&quot; itself to the nearest target lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104452\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104452 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-argon-plasma-coagulation-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thermal energy is delivered with a depth of penetration of roughly 2 to 3 mm. The heat produced denatures protein and evaporates intra- and extracellular water with the net effect of tissue destruction and coagulation.</p><p>Due to these features, APC is a useful modality for the treatment of <span class=\"nowrap\">superficial/flat</span> lesions, as well as those that are highly vascular or bleeding. Although the shallow depth of penetration compared with laser means that it is not as efficient at debulking tissue, it can still be used successfully for this purpose. In contrast with laser, the plasma coagulates both linearly and tangentially; thus, when ionized gas travels linearly, it coagulates the lesion in direct view of the bronchoscope, but, once it meets resistance, it travels laterally such that it can be used to treat lesions around folds or bends that are not clearly in view.

It is ideally suited to treating short, flat, intraluminal obstructing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding lesions, as well as those at or around bifurcations in the airway (eg, proximal segments of upper or lower lobe airways). It is not suitable for lesions causing CAO from extrinsic compression or for treating airway stenosis unrelated to an endobronchial lesion or tracheobronchomalacia. The outcome is best if the airway lumen can be visualized beyond the obstruction and the distal lung is still functional; however, obstructions in lobar or segmental bronchi or large, extensive lesions where an airway is not easily identified may be more amenable to APC than laser or electrocautery.

It is generally a palliative therapy used in patients for whom other first-line treatment modalities are not feasible, as well as in patients who require immediate relief from serious, life-threatening intraluminal obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemoptysis. Occasionally, it is used adjunctively before salvage chemotherapy, radiation, or resection. Ideal lesions suited to APC are those that are intraluminal, short (&lt;4 cm), vascular, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> superficial with a flat or polypoid shape (eg, papillomatosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68710\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68710 \">picture 2</a>)), as well as those that are located around bifurcations of airways. Ideally, functional lung beyond the obstruction should be visually evident. Its effects are generally temporary such that it is usually combined with other therapies (eg, stenting, dilation, brachytherapy, or external beam irradiation); alternatively, it can be repeated for palliative purposes.

However, case reports of successful management of other types of malignancy have been described, including endobronchial carcinoid (especially polypoid lesions) and metastatic tumors affecting the bronchus (eg, lung, breast, or colon) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-argon-plasma-coagulation-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H397557796\"><span class=\"h4\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Support for the use of APC in patients with malignant CAO is mostly derived from small, observational case series.

Our experience supports a database report of therapeutic bronchoscopy procedures that suggested that APC has replaced laser resection as the most commonly used thermal ablation modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-argon-plasma-coagulation-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>However, choosing which therapy to use in patients with airway tumors is dependent upon the tumor and patient characteristics, as well as local expertise, and should therefore be individualized for each patient. In addition, in practice, a combination of local therapies is used to optimize and maintain patency. As an example, initial tumor debulking with forceps, (ie, mechanical debridement) or removing surface eschar with cryoprobe can be utilized prior to APC (for further debulking). Among these modalities, only APC, electrocautery, and laser resection can destroy tissue rapidly and, therefore, have an immediate life-saving effect. APC may be more efficient than electrocautery or laser resection at achieving hemostasis but is less efficient at debulking tissue. The advantages and disadvantages of each bronchoscopic modality and choosing among the therapeutic options (both immediate-acting and maintenance therapies) in patients with CAO are discussed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72854 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64246 \">table 2</a>).

Similar to patients with malignancy, benign lesions best suited to bronchoscopic laser resection are short (ie, &lt;4 cm), flat, polypoid, intraluminal masses, particularly those associated with significant hemoptysis. Patients with extrinsic compression from benign extraluminal conditions (eg, large goiter, sarcoid-related lymphadenopathy) are not candidates for APC.

We suggest using the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An applied power of 15 to 25 watts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An argon flow rate of 0.3 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An application time of one to two seconds</p><p/><p>Adjusting the power setting and the application time affects how much tissue is destroyed. The higher the power and the longer the time, the more the tissue gets destroyed but, in general, with less control of depth of penetration. Also, higher power generates <span class=\"nowrap\">eschar/char</span> that can obstruct the gas exit from the probe and thus limits the APC effect by blocking access to fresh tissue. Higher gas flow rates tend to produce a &quot;longer&quot; flame, which, in theory, can cover more tissue. However, at airway bifurcations or with a large endobronchial tumor that prevents seeing the airway beyond the lesion, this longer flame will &quot;bend&quot; around the surface, resulting in treating tissue that is not visible, thereby increasing the risk of perforation. In addition, although higher flow rates tend to clear the field of debris and blood better than lower rates, they may carry a higher risk of gas embolism. General settings to which the operator may advance are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Applied power &ndash; Up to 80 watts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Argon flow rate &ndash; Up to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Application time &ndash; Up to three seconds but can apply as long as desired (eg, five seconds)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H230606603\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoscopic APC can be performed using a rigid or flexible bronchoscope, the former being more common. For those suitable for flexible bronchoscopy (eg, patients with a stable airway and mild obstruction), the procedure can be performed under conscious sedation, while sicker patients, particularly those with an unstable airway, may be more suitable for rigid bronchoscopy, which is performed under general anesthesia. Once the patient is sufficiently sedated or anesthetized, bronchoscopy is performed, and the target lesion is visually identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rigid-bronchoscopy-instrumentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rigid bronchoscopy: Instrumentation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rigid-bronchoscopy-intubation-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rigid bronchoscopy: Intubation techniques&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A flexible probe, which can be 1.5 up to 3.2 mm in diameter and 150 up to 330 cm in length, is then passed through the instrument channel of the bronchoscope or through the open barrel of a rigid bronchoscope and advanced until the location of its tip meets the following criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72597\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72597 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104452\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104452 \">picture 1</a>). There may be little difference in effect between the different diameter probes; however, the smaller probes allow their use with bronchoscopes with smaller diameter working channels. Additionally, using a smaller diameter probe with a larger working channel allows suctioning of smoke and debris around the probe, allowing for visualization of the field. &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The probe tip should be several centimeters beyond the bronchoscope's tip to ensure that the bronchoscope will not be burned. Based on personal experience we feel &gt;2 cm is satisfactory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The probe tip should be several centimeters beyond the endotracheal (ET) tube or a covered metal or nonmetallic stent before firing to prevent damage or fire.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The probe tip should be within 1 cm of the target lesion but preferably not in contact with the lesion. The electric current will not be conducted if the probe is too far away from the target lesion (ie, the electrical circuit will be open). In contrast, when the probe is in contact with tissue when fired, char often develops quickly on the probe tip, which blocks gas exit and current generation, thereby limiting APC effectiveness.</p><p/><p>To debulk an obstructing lesion, the surface eschar is removed (eg, with forceps or a cryotherapy probe), and, then, APC is applied systematically to the underlying fresh tissue in one- to three-second bursts until the obstructing lesion is debulked sufficiently. The bronchoscopist starts at the initial settings and then incrementally increases the power (up to 80 watts) and time (up to three seconds, occasionally longer), according to the observed effect (see <a href=\"#H230606580\" class=\"local\">'Equipment settings'</a> above). The depth and volume of tissue impacted depend upon the applied power and the application time and perhaps, to a lesser degree, the gas flow rate. Thus, small, shallow lesions typically require less power and application time, while larger and deeper lesions require greater amounts of power and time. During the procedure, fragments of tissue should be aggressively removed manually, using a forceps, suction, or cryotherapy, so that fresh tumor can be ablated.</p><p>To achieve hemostasis, firing APC in short bursts (a few seconds) while moving the probe back and forth, &quot;painting the airway,&quot; is often effective.</p><p>The probe should not be fired outside the airway to avoid shocking or burning staff, the patient, or the operator.</p><p>In our experience, the procedure should take no longer than one hour to achieve the target goal (eg, decrease obstruction, achieve hemostasis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific complications of bronchoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) are infrequent (typically less than 1 percent of procedures) but range from 0.5 to 4 percent, the most common of which are airway fire and airway perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-argon-plasma-coagulation-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/2,4,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,20-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H317425367\"><span class=\"h2\">Types</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bronchoscopy or sedation related</strong> &ndash; Many of the complications associated with bronchoscopic APC are related to the bronchoscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the sedation.

When brisk bleeding complicates the procedure, increasing the argon flow rate may blow blood away from the source, thereby providing better visualization of the culprit lesion. As with the other ablative techniques, perforating a large vessel can occur, with a serious adverse outcome. Care in selecting the target, the APC settings, and in applying the technique should minimize this risk. Should uncontrollable hemorrhage occur, intubation is necessary (if not already performed) so that other measures can be taken to achieve hemostasis, the details of which are discussed separately.

Other indications include the treatment of benign conditions associated with CAO (eg, polyp removal, debridement of granulation tissue around endobronchial stents), airway bleeding, and microinvasive radiographically occult lung cancer (ROLC).

In addition, patients on high-flow oxygen (fraction of inspired oxygen &gt;0.4) are not good candidates for bronchoscopic APC. While patients with nonmetallic or covered metallic airway stents or patients with extensive endobronchial lesions are also not ideal candidates, some experts perform APC in select patients in these groups when the benefits are assessed by the bronchoscopist to outweigh the risks.
