Macroscopically, there is a scarred appearance with fibrous or fibro-fatty replacement of myocardium. Multiple reports have historically characterized these pathologic changes as the &quot;triangle of dysplasia&quot; involving the inflow tract, outflow tract, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> apex of the RV. However, more recent data have noted involvement of the posterolateral left ventricle (LV) with sparing of the RV apex early in the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Early reports highlighted the increase in RV myocardial fat; however, this is now recognized to be of very low diagnostic specificity, present in normal and difficult to differentiate from the aging process, particularly in an obese individual, and of low reproducibility when measured with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The RV myocardial scarring initially produces typical regional wall motion abnormalities but later may involve the free wall and become global, producing RV dilation. The tissue replacement can also involve areas of the LV with relative sparing of the septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Clinical perspectives of ARVC primarily arise from experience with patients who present with arrhythmias of RV origin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sudden death. However, additional information has been learned regarding the clinical features and clinical course of subjects identified based on electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and by cascade family screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Presentation is most common between the ages of 10 and 50 years, with a mean age at diagnosis of approximately 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. The disease is virtually never diagnosed in infants or toddlers and uncommonly before the age of 10. The diagnosis of ARVC requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and frequently multiple diagnostic tests or procedures. Because many of the clinical findings and test results are neither highly sensitive nor specific for ARVC, diagnostic criteria have been published by professional societies in an effort to standardize the diagnostic.</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected ARVC, and the <span class=\"nowrap\">diagnosis/diagnostic</span> criteria of ARVC, will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, genetics, anatomy, histology, clinical manifestations, treatment, and prognosis of ARVC are discussed separately.

Some experts also perform exercise ECG testing in patients with suspected ARVC, but this is not universally done. Most patients who present with arrhythmia and a suspected diagnosis of ARVC can be diagnosed using a combination of noninvasive electrocardiographic and imaging evaluations. If this initial noninvasive evaluation strongly points toward a diagnosis of ARVC, or if diagnostic criteria are met, genetic testing should also be performed.

The pre-test probability of an ARVC diagnosis will range from 1:2 to 1:2000-5000 and is important in interpreting symptoms or abnormal test results. </p><p>In an individual with unexplained arrhythmia features or electrocardiographic abnormalities, the family history focusing on unexplained premature deaths, arrhythmia symptoms, and conduction disease may identify familial disease, which facilitates <span class=\"nowrap\">diagnosis/clarification</span> of abnormalities in the proband. In a patient who fulfills diagnostic criteria, clinical evaluation of at least first-degree relatives is strongly recommended, given the possible 50 percent probability of inheriting a disease-causing mutation. Otherwise unexplained abnormalities in the context of proven familial disease will have a high probability of reflecting disease expression, which may or may not be complete.

While a completely normal ECG makes the diagnosis of ARVC extremely unlikely, some studies have reported a normal ECG in patients who otherwise meet Task Force Criteria for ARVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13</a>]. The sensitivity of ECG alone for the presence of ARVC is suboptimal, with as many as 40 to 50 percent of patients having a normal ECG at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13</a>]. </p><p>ECG abnormalities observed in ARVC include the following, some of which are included in the 2010 revised Task Force Criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58452\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58452 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged S wave upstroke (interval from the nadir of the S wave to the isoelectric baseline &ge;55 msec) &ndash; This finding was identified in 91 to 95 percent of ARVC patients who did not have RBBB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F115615\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef115615 \">waveform 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>].

This finding represents low amplitude potentials caused by delayed activation of some portion of the RV.

The extent of T-wave inversion has been correlated with the degree of RV enlargement as well as the risk for ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

The incidence of ECG evolution is probably in part due to the high-risk cohort, as evidenced by the high rate of ventricular arrhythmias and the fact that all patients met diagnostic criteria for ARVC at the time of the baseline ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 68 patients, 16 (23 percent) showed dynamic T wave changes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Epsilon waves during three-year follow-up; these <span class=\"nowrap\">changes/evolution</span> were associated with younger age and markers of early disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H576168529\"><span class=\"h3\">Ambulatory monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients in whom ARVC is being considered should have ambulatory ECG monitoring for 24 to 48 hours.

In one study of 40 patients with confirmed ARVC by 2010 revised Task Force Criteria who underwent continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring for an average of 159 hours, average VPB count per 24 hours was 1091 VPBs, although significant day-to-day variation in VPB burden was noted in more than three-quarters of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The QRS interval of the VPB when prolonged may help distinguish VPBs related to ARVC from other causes, including right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4213356856\"><span class=\"h3\">ECG with isoproterenol infusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Isoproterenol</a>, a beta-agonist medication, may be helpful for the provocation of ventricular arrhythmias in patients suspected of having ARVC.

Screening of first-degree relatives with a history, physical examination, ECG, and echocardiogram is reasonable with selective use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) based on the experience of a particular center with CMR imaging for diagnosis of ARVC. First-degree relatives are to be screened every two to five years depending on their age and activity levels. For first-degree relatives who are endurance or competitive athletes, annual screening should be considered while the individual is participating in athletics at this level. </p><p>Once a diagnosis is confirmed in the proband, serial clinical evaluation of first-degree relatives is warranted, as one study of a cohort from two arrhythmia referral centers identified ARVC in 35 percent of first-degree relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Genetic testing should also be recommended for patients diagnosed with ARVC as well as those in whom the diagnosis is suspected. If a pathogenic mutation is found in the proband, downstream genetic testing for the identified pathogenic mutation is advised for all first-degree relatives. The precise intervals for clinical evaluation will depend on the logistics and perceived risk for family members. In one study, 30 percent of relatives experienced disease progression during four-year follow-up, and the disease manifestations were electrical rather than structural [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. These data support initial clinical evaluation of relatives with ECG and echocardiography, and serial evaluation annually, focusing on electrical manifestations of disease detected on 12-lead, ambulatory, and exercise electrocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3842874267\" class=\"local\">'12-lead ECG'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients in whom the diagnosis of ARVC is being considered should have a transthoracic echocardiogram or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging performed. Echocardiographic findings suggestive of ARVC include enlargement of the right ventricular outflow tract with reduced RV function and areas of akinesis, dyskinesis, or aneurysm. (See <a href=\"#H3143755798\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend CMR imaging or right ventriculography in all patients with suspected ARVC, particularly in those patients whose other test results and clinical features have led to a definite diagnosis of ARVC based on the 2010 revised Task Force Criteria. CMR should ideally be performed in a center with expertise in the evaluation of CMR for abnormalities suggestive of ARVC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F115616\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef115616 \">image 2</a>). CMR should be performed prior to implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation, as imaging of the right ventricle is suboptimal with an ICD lead in patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approved or compatible ICDs. (See <a href=\"#H3947332188\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H417594610\" class=\"local\">'Right ventriculography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrophysiologic (EP) testing in ARVC is rarely indicated as part of diagnostic or prognostic evaluation. In patients with refractory ventricular arrhythmias and in those with possible right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia, however, EP testing along with ablation of the arrhythmia may be performed. (See <a href=\"#H1521893822\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiologic testing and electroanatomic mapping'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend genetic testing in all patients with definite ARVC (per task force criteria) and suggest it in those with suspected ARVC (&gt;1 minor task force criteria). (See <a href=\"#H3321285997\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ARVC is most commonly made in patients with suspicious clinical manifestations (eg, palpitations, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, etc) using information obtained from surface ECG and cardiac imaging (typically echocardiography with or without CMR). The diagnosis of ARVC can be challenging, requiring a high degree of clinical suspicion and frequently multiple diagnostic tests or procedures to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Because many of the clinical findings and test results have reduced sensitivity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> specificity for ARVC, diagnostic criteria have been published by professional societies in an effort to standardize the process of arriving at the correct diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1211313735\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening of first-degree relatives over 10 years of age with a history, physical examination, ECG, and echocardiogram <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CMR is recommended every two to five years depending on their exercise levels and whether they are a sibling, parent, or child.
