Bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomonas vaginitis are the most common causes of vaginal discharge in premenopausal women. When these conditions have been excluded, other causes of vaginal discharge must be considered in the differential diagnosis of women with vaginal complaints. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis is a chronic clinical syndrome of unknown etiology. Most investigators believe it is primarily an inflammatory vaginitis of non-infectious etiology, with secondary bacterial microbiota disruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, others consider the primary defect to be an alteration in vaginal flora (eg, Escherichia coli), and have termed the constellation of findings &quot;aerobic vaginitis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636764\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis occurs in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. It is more common in perimenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636801\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author and most North American investigators believe desquamative inflammatory vaginitis is an inflammatory vaginitis of non-infectious etiology, with secondary bacterial microbiota disruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some other investigators believe the disorder is due to altered vaginal flora (eg, Escherichia coli), and have termed the spectrum of findings &quot;aerobic vaginitis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. No consistent microbiologic pathogen has been identified except for the near absence of lactobacilli in almost all women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3490389\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis is characterized by pain (dyspareunia, <span class=\"nowrap\">vaginal/introital</span> pain, burning) with diffuse exudative vaginitis and epithelial cell exfoliation, resulting in profuse vaginal discharge (usually yellow but may be gray or green) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a large series of 98 patients diagnosed with desquamative inflammatory vaginitis (mean age 49.6 years), 70 to 90 percent had purulent vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, and vaginal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>On vaginal examination, a spotty ecchymotic rash is often present, or there may be diffuse or focal erythema or linear erosions. The vestibule is often affected, and may be thinned, sensitive, erythematous, and edematous as a result of irritation from the discharge.</p><p>Vaginal pH is invariably increased (&gt;4.5).</p><p>Saline wet mount microscopy shows an increased number of parabasal and inflammatory cells and the leukocyte to epithelial cell ratio is greater than 1:1. Parabasal cells are immature squamous epithelial cells that are rounded and have a large nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio; in contrast, mature squamous epithelial cells are larger, cuboidal, with a smaller nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, and sometimes folded. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3490215\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis requires all of the following criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least one of the following symptoms: vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, pruritus, burning, irritation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal inflammation (spotted ecchymotic rash, erythema, focal or linear erosion)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal pH &gt;4.5</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saline microscopy showing increased numbers of parabasal and inflammatory cells (leukocyte to epithelial cell ratio greater than 1:1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77244\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77244 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p>Bacterial vaginosis and <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, <em>C. trachomatis</em>, and <em>T. vaginalis</em> infection should be excluded. Negative microscopy is not sufficient to rule out trichomoniasis; DNA diagnostic tests should be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trichomoniasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3490310\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In hypoestrogenemic women, severe atrophic vaginitis can mimic desquamative inflammatory vaginitis; the wet mount is similar for both conditions. Improvement in symptoms with estrogen therapy helps distinguish atrophic vaginitis from desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other disorders in the differential diagnosis include erosive lichen planus, pemphigus vulgaris, and cicatricial pemphigoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis typically occurs in perimenopausal women, while erosive lichen planus and cicatricial pemphigoid typically occur in menopausal women.</p><p>Purulent discharge is a prominent finding in desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, normal vulvovaginal architecture is maintained, and there are no extra genital findings. In contrast, the vaginal epithelium in lichen planus is friable, easily bleeding upon speculum insertion or with coitus. Small areas of inflammation and increased vaginal discharge may be present, or the vagina may be massively inflamed and denuded with a seropurulent exudate, pseudomembrane, or serosanguineous vaginal discharge. In severe cases, adhesions and synechiae develop, which can lead to narrowing or obliteration of the vagina. Extragenital mucous membrane disease is common (particularly the mouth). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-planus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen planus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-planus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen planus&quot;, section on 'Erosive lichen planus'</a>.)</p><p>Unlike desquamative inflammatory vaginitis and lichen planus, both pemphigus vulgaris and cicatricial pemphigoid begin as blisters, which soon degenerate into nonspecific erosions. As with lichen planus, women with pemphigus vulgaris and cicatricial pemphigoid are likely to have evidence of extragenital mucous membrane disease (particularly the mouth). Cicatricial pemphigoid, but not pemphigus vulgaris, leads to scarring.</p><p>Biopsy from the edge of an erosion or blister for histopathological examination and immunofluorescence studies are needed to confirm these other diagnoses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-planus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen planus&quot;, section on 'Erosive lichen planus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pemphigus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of pemphigus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid-and-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3490208\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No randomized trials of treatment approaches have been reported. The two most common treatments are intravaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> or glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Options for initial therapy include either of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> cream 4 to 5 grams intravaginally once daily, <strong>or</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>10% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> cream 3 to 5 grams intravaginally once daily</p><p/><p>Ten percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> cream is not commercially available, but can be compounded by a pharmacist. </p><p>For mild disease, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> one-half or one 25 mg rectal suppository placed in the vagina twice daily is another option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Treatment is typically prescribed for four to six weeks, and leads to dramatic improvement in symptoms in most patients. The patient is seen in follow-up after four weeks. If complete clinical and microscopic remission is achieved, defined as complete absence of signs and symptoms of disease and no increase in leukocytes or parabasal cells on saline microscopy, treatment can be stopped. If she has improved but is not in complete remission, treatment is continued until complete remission is achieved; this may take another two or more weeks. Vaginal pH will return to normal when remission is achieved, except in women on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> since clindamycin reduces colonization by lactobacilli. Upon complete remission, therapy is discontinued and the patient is followed monthly for several months to ensure that remission is maintained.</p><p>If there has been no or poor improvement after the initial four weeks of therapy, other diagnoses in the differential diagnosis should be considered; if these diagnoses are excluded, we switch to a different therapy, eg, from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> or vice versa, for a four- to six-week course.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7433846\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrence and relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who do not relapse within a few months are likely to be cured, but late relapse is possible (see <a href=\"#H3490483\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below). Patients who relapse after discontinuation of therapy are treated with the drug that was not used for their initial treatment (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> instead of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> or vice versa). This drug is continued until complete remission is again achieved, and then tapered gradually. The taper and maintenance regimen varies from patient to patient. We continue to slowly taper therapy as long as the patient has no symptoms and there is no increase in leukocytes and parabasal cells on microscopy. If symptoms occur or there is an increase in leukocytes and parabasal cells (even if the patient is asymptomatic), we increase the dose to achieve remission and then slowly taper to the lowest dose at which the patient remains in remission. Some patients require use of suppressive therapy for months or years before it is possible to discontinue therapy without relapse.</p><p>Adrenal suppression does not occur in women using 10% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> for prolonged periods. We do not suggest routine prophylaxis against vulvovaginal candidiasis in these patients.</p><p>In difficult to treat cases, judicious use of intravaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> may be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3490483\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrence is common after discontinuation of therapy. In one study, only one fourth of patients remained cured at one year after a single course of therapy and one-third of patients relapsed within six weeks of discontinuing initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Treatment of these patients is discussed above (see <a href=\"#H7433846\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence and relapse'</a> above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
