central nervous system (CNS) tumors includes a multimodal approach of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The confirmation of a CNS tumor warrants a referral to a neurosurgeon for further evaluation, tissue biopsy, and gross total resection where possible. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are used as adjunct measures based on the histology of the tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An open surgical procedure is the preferred approach to obtain tissue for a histologic diagnosis and bulk removal of the tumor where possible. A pediatric neurosurgeon should be involved, if possible, as they are best able to perform tumor resection with limited long-term morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In most cases, near-total resection can be achieved. However, complete resection is generally limited by the inability to remove the tumor with surrounding clear margins of normal tissue because of the risk of producing permanent neurologic deficits, and to remove scattered tumor cells that have infiltrated beyond the margins of the resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Adjunct therapy (ie, radiation therapy and chemotherapy) is required.</p><p>Deep seated tumors, such as diffuse infiltrative brainstem and chiasmatic gliomas, are associated with a high risk of irreversible neurologic sequelae in an open surgical approach. In these cases, tissues for histologic diagnosis can be obtained using stereotactic biopsy techniques guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Endoscopic biopsy is another option for intraventricular or periventricular tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical approaches and techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major risk of extensive tumor resection is injury to the surrounding tissue, especially in functionally critical parts of the brain, which can result in long-term neurologic impairment. Advances in operative microscopy with better visualization of the interface between the tumor and the surrounding normal tissue have resulted in safer surgical resection and lower neurologic morbidity.</p><p>In cases where the tumor is in a functionally critical site <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there is poor demarcation of the tumor from its surroundings, the following techniques have been used to minimize injury to the adjacent normal tissue:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative stereotactic imaging to guide the surgical approach in order to minimize manipulation of normal tissue and maximize tumor resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative MRI imaging, including functional MRI to aid in intraoperative decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring of visual, auditory, and somatosensory pathways in cases that involve functionally critical zones to minimize injury to normal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]</p><p/><p>Postoperative imaging, preferably by MRI, is performed within the first 24 to 72 hours to determine the extent of tumor resection.

Patients who have radiographic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical signs of elevated ICP require urgent neurosurgical intervention (eg, tumor resection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> placement of a shunt to relieve hydrocephalus, if present) to prevent serious morbidity and death.</p><p>Although tumor resection may lead to resolution of hydrocephalus, preoperative shunting is often performed to relieve the increased ICP, reducing the potential risk of herniation. Shunting is usually performed by placing an external ventricular drain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56391 \">figure 1</a>) just prior to craniotomy for tumor resection. Postoperatively, the shunt allows drainage of bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and debris. It is usually removed within a few days after normal CSF flow is re-established following tumor resection. In some cases with persistent obstruction of CSF flow, endoscopic third ventriculostomy, a procedure in which a perforation is made to connect the third ventricle to the subarachnoid space, or a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis#H635770891\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydrocephalus in children: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'CSF diversion procedures'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with elevated ICP due to CNS tumors are typically treated with corticosteroid therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a>) in the perioperative period to reduce peritumor edema. Intravenous dexamethasone (0.25 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> administered every six hours with a maximum dose of 16 mg per day) is given preoperatively and is continued intraoperatively and during the early postoperative period to reduce edema associated with the surgical procedure. In most cases, dexamethasone can be discontinued postoperatively because tumor volume is reduced following resection. However, children with tumors that are not amenable to resection (eg, brainstem lesions) may require protracted dexamethasone therapy and are at risk for its side effects.

Although most studies are of adult patients with brain tumors, the results are most likely applicable to pediatric patients as well.

For example, patients whose posterior pituitary gland is injured or resected during surgery may have impaired fluid and electrolyte regulation with an initial phase of transient diabetes insipidus (DI), followed by a period of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release, and a final persistent phase of DI.

The use of radiation therapy is dependent on the histologic diagnosis of the tumor, whether there is an effective chemotherapeutic alternative, and the age of the child. Radiation therapy is usually avoided in children &lt;3 years old because of the risk of severe neurocognitive sequelae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation#H4139131\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed complications of cranial irradiation&quot;, section on 'Neurocognitive effects'</a>.)</p><p>When radiation therapy is selected, planning the target volume (local versus craniospinal) and the dose of radiation therapy takes into consideration the tumor location, stage and subtype of the tumor, expected patterns of spread, availability of effective chemotherapy, and age of the patient.</p><p>Radiation therapy is generally delivered by conventional external beam. Other techniques include three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (targeting the radiation to conform to the size and shape of the tumor), and stereotactic radiosurgery. The different techniques of radiation therapy administration are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stereotactic-cranial-radiosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stereotactic cranial radiosurgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although an effective adjunct, radiation therapy is associated with both acute and long-term complications, particularly in infants and young children whose nervous systems are still developing. The complications of cranial radiation can be categorized into three phases and are summarized as follows. A more detailed discussion of the complications of cranial radiation is provided in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complications of cranial irradiation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed complications of cranial irradiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute reactions occur during treatment and are caused by injury to the brain that results in inflammation and edema. Symptoms include headache, nausea, drowsiness, focal neurologic deficits, and fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early-delayed reactions occur from a few weeks to three months after radiation treatment, and are thought to be due to a combination of tumor response, peritumor edema, and demyelination. Findings include transient focal neurologic deficits, somnolence syndrome (characterized by extreme sleepiness and signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), such as headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and irritability), and asymptomatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement, which may be difficult to distinguish from tumor progression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late reactions occur &gt;90 days after radiation treatment and generally are irreversible. They are due to radiation-induced brain necrosis at or near the site of the tumor that has received the highest radiation dose, diffuse white matter injury (ie, leukoencephalopathy), secondary malignancies, and vasculopathy. General findings include impaired neurocognitive function, and social and behavioral deficits. In a retrospective study of 101 children with brain tumors treated with cranial radiation, 5 percent developed radiation necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Depending on the location of the tumor and field of radiation, other complications, such as hearing impairment, hypothalamic and pituitary endocrinopathies, and visual impairment secondary to cataracts, optic neuropathy, retinopathy, or cortical blindness, may arise.</p><p/><p>Various strategies, such as decreasing the radiation dose for patients with relatively lower risk disease, and three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy have been adopted to minimize the long-term complications associated with radiation therapy. The latter minimizes radiation to adjacent normal tissue by customizing the treatment to deliver maximum radiation within the contour of the tumor volume, regardless of its shape. Proton beam therapy also minimizes the harmful effects of radiation to neighboring normal tissues because of its unique ability of depositing most of its energy (proton) at the targeted area. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stereotactic-cranial-radiosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stereotactic cranial radiosurgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Proton radiation therapy has emerged as a treatment in some brain tumors. Compared with standard photon-based radiation therapy, proton therapy decreases low-dose radiation exposure to uninvolved brain and to structures anterior to the craniospinal axis. In the short term, these features of proton therapy may increase tolerance of concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy by decreasing hematologic and gastrointestinal side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the long term, proton therapy may reduce the risk of neurocognitive, endocrine, vascular, and developmental sequelae of radiation therapy, as well as the risk of radiation-induced second malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

These agents include monoclonal antibodies that bind VEGF, inhibitors of tyrosine kinases within the VEGF pathway, and inhibitors of protein kinase C, a major component of the VEGF pathway.

An open surgical procedure is the preferred approach for most childhood brain tumors to obtain tissue for a histologic diagnosis and bulk removal where possible. Tumors deeply located in the brain are not amenable to open surgical intervention because of the high risk of irreversible neurologic impairment. In these cases, histologic diagnosis can be obtained using stereotactic biopsy techniques guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). Intraventricular and periventricular lesions could also be biopsied endoscopically. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Management strategy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with radiographic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical evidence of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) require urgent neurosurgical intervention (eg, tumor resection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> placement of a shunt to relieve hydrocephalus). In addition, we suggest perioperative corticosteroid therapy to reduce peritumoral edema (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In our practice, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> (0.25 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every six hours, with a maximum dose of 16 mg per day). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Elevated ICP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures are common in patients with brain tumors. For patients who have experienced one or more seizures associated with a brain tumor, we recommend initial treatment with a single agent antiseizure drug (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The choice of agent is based on drug interactions, safety profile, and clinician and patient preference. We recommend <strong>not</strong> using prophylactic anticonvulsants in patients without a history of seizures (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The exception is the use of postoperative seizure prophylaxis at the discretion of the neurosurgeon. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Seizures'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with brain tumors may have endocrine abnormalities, especially those with lesions located in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Management is focused on treating the specific endocrine abnormalities and may require hormonal replacement therapy. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of radiation therapy is dependent on the histologic diagnosis of the tumor. Although radiation therapy is an effective adjunct, it is associated with both acute and long-term complications. In particular, infants and young children with developing nervous systems are at increased risk for long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. Long-term complications are generally irreversible and include radiation necrosis, white matter injury, vasculopathy, and secondary malignancies. The timing, dose, and field of radiation is based on the histology, tumor location and size, stage of the tumor, the expected patterns of spread, and the availability of effective chemotherapy agents. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed complications of cranial irradiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of chemotherapy is dependent on the underlying tissue histology. It is routinely used in combination with surgery and radiation therapy for older children to treat embryonal tumors (eg, medulloblastoma). In young children and infants with embryonal tumors, low-grade gliomas, and optic glioma, chemotherapy is used after surgical resection to delay or avoid the need for radiation therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite advances in the care of children with CNS tumors, mortality and morbidity remain high. CNS tumors account for one-quarter of deaths in childhood cancer and have a five-year survival rate of approximately 73 percent. In addition, survivors of pediatric CNS tumors are at risk for secondary neoplasms and neurologic, cognitive, endocrine, social, and psychological sequelae. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatric palliative care should be provided to children with life-threatening CNS tumors, while maintaining their quality of life.
