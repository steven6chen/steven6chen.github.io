Organic farmers attempt to protect the environment by using natural matter (eg, aged manure, humus, and compost) for fertilizer and biological methods of pest control (eg, crop rotation and natural insect predators like lady bugs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Livestock and poultry used for egg, dairy, and meat production are raised on organically grown feed, without antibiotics or hormones, and provided with access to the outdoors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The standards for growing and labeling organic food may vary depending upon the certifying organization or agency. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], as well as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States have adopted or proposed guidelines for the production, processing, labeling, and marketing of organic foods in an attempt to ensure that all foods that are labeled organic meet the same minimum standards.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11115603\"><span class=\"h2\">Labeling requirements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As of April, 2008, food that is labeled &quot;100 percent organic&quot; or &quot;organic&quot; in the United States must meet the standards of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), with the following labeling requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To be labeled as &quot;100 percent organic,&quot; all ingredients must be certified as organically produced and processed (excluding water and salt). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To be labeled &quot;organic,&quot; foods must consist of at least 95 percent certified organically processed ingredients (excluding water and salt); the remaining 5 percent of ingredients may be non-organically produced but must be on the USDA's National List. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Products at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients (excluding water and salt) can use the claim &quot;made with organic ingredients&quot; and may list up to three individual organically produced ingredients on the side panel, but may not claim to be organic on the front of the package.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11115610\"><span class=\"h2\">Market growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consumer demand for organic foods has grown steadily during the past decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. In a study of 28,245 French adults, the average consumption of organic food was 18 to 20 percent of the diet, less than 12 percent of the respondents reported never consuming organic food in the past year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The contribution of organic food from products of plant origin was higher than that from products of animal origin. Organic foods, including organic infant formulas, are available increasingly in supermarkets and chain food stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Producers, exporters, and retailers are struggling to meet consumer demand for a wide range of organic food products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In 2011, organic food sales represented 4.2 percent of total retail food sales in the United States, up from 1.4 percent in 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Individuals who routinely consume organic food are more likely to be vegetarian and report food allergies compared with occasional organic food consumers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>According to the USDA, the area of farmland devoted to organic crop production more than doubled between 2000 and 2008, increasing from 1.2 million acres to 2.7 million acres. During the same time period, the area of farmland devoted to organic pasture more than quadrupled, increasing from 567 thousand acres to 2.2 million acres. Certified organic farmland is found in all 50 US states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several large food companies (eg, Sunrise cereal from General Mills Company) have begun to market organic products.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retail sales of organic foods in the United States have grown from approximately $1 billion in 1990 to $39 billion in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Fresh produce (fruits and vegetables) are the top-selling organic category followed by organic dairy products; organic products now represent 12 percent and 6 percent of all United States fruit and vegetable sales and dairy sales, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22</a>].</p><p/><p>The increased demand for organically grown food can be attributed to [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/6,12,16,17,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12,16,17,23-25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concern about the nutritional adequacy of foods grown by conventional agriculture</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concern that pesticides and chemical fertilizers have adverse health effects</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concern about environmental effects of pesticides and chemical fertilizers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concern about adverse developmental and health effects from ingesting meat from animals treated with antibiotics, sex steroids, and hormone supplementation.</p><p/><p>Demand for food purity has increased despite governmental assurances that the American food supply is one of the safest in the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/16,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26</a>]. Organically grown foods are promoted as and perceived by consumers to be healthier than conventionally grown foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/12,23,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,23,27,28</a>].</p><p>Pediatric healthcare providers should be prepared to help the parents of their patients make informed decisions regarding the purchase and consumption of organic foods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advocates of organic foods claim that organically grown foods are nutritionally superior to foods grown with conventional agriculture methods that use chemical fertilizers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/6,16,23,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16,23,29,30</a>]. Many people believe that commercial fertilizers lack some nutrients that are present in &quot;natural&quot; organic fertilizers. They argue that &quot;natural&quot; fertilizers are better able to nourish plants and thus result in more nutritious foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, there is little evidence that organic foods have higher nutritional quality than conventionally-produced foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/5,8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,14</a>].</p><p>The nutrient content of a plant is determined by several factors, including the genetic makeup, climate and soil conditions, maturity at harvest, storage, and distribution time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31</a>]. Nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous, the main soil nutrients required by crops, must be present in sufficient amounts for plants to grow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Fertilization enriches soil by providing the necessary nutrients. It does not matter whether organic or synthetic fertilizers are used as long as all of the essential nutrients are provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Synthetic fertilizers are formulated to meet this requirement. Organic fertilizers may or may not. Organic fertilizers (typically manure) must be converted to soluble mineral salts by soil bacteria before they can be utilized by plants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Manure breakdown cannot be synchronized with crop growth. In addition, the nutrient benefit of manure is unpredictable because its composition varies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Nutrient-deficient soil affects crop yields to a greater extent than it affects nutritional value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The nutritional content of organically and conventionally grown foods usually are similar regarding carbohydrate or vitamins and minerals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/25,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,33,34</a>]; however, organic vegetables may have lower nitrate and protein content than conventionally grown foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/1,5,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,35-37</a>]. In general, organic meats are higher in total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and omega-3 (n-3) PUFA compared with conventional meats, although these comparisons are somewhat limited because of sample heterogeneity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>The nutritional composition of milk and dairy products may vary because of dietary components of feed, time of year, and whether the farms are conventional or organic. However, milk produced by both organically and conventionally reared cows has similar protein, vitamin, total lipids, and trace mineral content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. One study in England comparing milk obtained from conventional and organic farms found that organic milk had significantly higher levels of total PUFA (including conjugated linoleic acid and &#1072;lpha-linolenic acid); very long chain n-3 PUFA (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], docosapentaenoic acid [DPA]) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); alpha-tocopherol; and iron; but lower iodine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">selenium</a> concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. </p><p>Regardless of the increased cost of organically grown produce and possible risks of pesticide residues, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the American Medical Society, and the American Cancer Society recommend a diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables, with between five and nine servings of these foods daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/25,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,41-43</a>].

One observational study and two systematic reviews that included this study, found no overall association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/33,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,44,45</a>]. However, a subgroup analysis suggested that consumption of organic dairy products is associated with a modestly lower risk for eczema, as compared with consumption of conventional dairy products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The authors speculate that this protective effect might be due to the antiinflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids, which are found at higher levels in organic dairy products as compared with conventional dairy products. Because these studies are observational, these findings might be due to other elements of the diet or environment that were not included in the analysis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3015328433\"><span class=\"h1\">METABOLIC SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data suggest an inverse association between a diet based largely on organic foods and the metabolic syndrome. The most useful information comes from the NutriNet&ndash;Sante study, which is an observational study of diet and markers of metabolic health in more than 8000 French men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Higher organic food consumption was associated with a lower probability of having the metabolic syndrome, even after adjusting for body mass index (BMI). The negative association persisted after adjusting for diet quality, sociodemographic, and lifestyle variables. A similar negative association was found for consumption of organic products from plant-food and dairy groups (fruits and vegetables, starchy foods, whole-grain products, oil, eggs, and dairy products), but not for organic sources of seafood, meat, poultry, and processed meat. Higher organic food consumption was associated with lower fasting blood glucose, serum triglycerides, waist circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the individuals who were not taking medications for these related disorders. A separate report from the same study population found a negative association between organic food consumption and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>Because of its observational nature, this study cannot establish a causal association between consumption of organic foods and improved metabolic health. Moreover, even if the association is causal, the mechanism is unclear, since a diet of organic foods tends to have more favorable nutrition profile, in addition to lower pesticide exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Organically grown foods may cost 10 to 50 percent more than conventionally grown foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/25,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,48</a>], the reasons for which include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/3,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,49</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The smaller supply; organic farmers are fewer and crop yields and smaller</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increased cost of certification and labor intensity of growing food without synthetic pesticides and chemicals</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">FOOD SAFETY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three areas of food safety to consider when comparing organic and conventionally grown foods are microbial infection, natural toxins, and pesticide use.

Young children are particularly vulnerable because of the immaturity of their immune systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7, Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter jejuni are the major pathogens of foodborne illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute infectious diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Foods can become contaminated by fertilization with raw manure, irrigation of crops with contaminated water, or inadvertent contact with fecal matter during handling or processing. The risk of contamination with bacteria resistant to <strong>multiple</strong> antibiotics is higher in conventional as compared with organic farming methods, but the overall risk of bacterial contamination is not different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Illness caused by E. coli O157:H7, for example, has been linked to fresh-pressed apple juice and cider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/5,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,55</a>]. Pasteurization, canning, and freezing help to prevent illness caused by Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter, and Listeria monocytogenes contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].

Most of these naturally occurring toxins are harmless when eaten in small amounts as part of a healthy diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As with pesticides, &quot;poison&quot; is a matter of dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pesticides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of the debate about organic and conventional agriculture centers on the use of pesticides. Promoters of organic foods suggest that the pesticides used in commercial farming are detrimental to food safety and health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Surveys show that individuals who purchase organic foods believe that pesticides, at any level of exposure, are hazardous to health, food safety, and the environment, and that something must be done to reduce this risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/52,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,63,64</a>].</p><p>Many people are frightened by reports of pesticides in conventionally-grown foods, although the reports often lack scientific peer review. Media attention may perpetuate this misinformation. In 1989, for example, the media portrayed alar, a growth regulator used mainly on apples, as a potent cancer-causing threat to children. As a result, apples and apple products treated with alar were destroyed and alar was voluntarily withdrawn from the domestic market. However, many health authorities, including the Surgeon General and the American Medical Association, issued statements that alar poses no risk to the public's health when used in the approved, regulated fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Although organic farmers avoid the use of synthetic pesticides, organic foods sometimes contain synthetic pesticide residues, probably because of cross-contamination by wind and groundwater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/16,26,65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26,65,66</a>]. The frequency and amount of pesticide residue in organic foods are usually lower than in conventionally grown foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/5,33,67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,33,67-69</a>].

However, the risk of pesticide contamination exceeding maximum allowed limits was small for both farming methods. Of note, all plants produce toxins (&quot;natural pesticides&quot;) that protect them from fungi, insects, and predators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/16,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,70,71</a>].

Similarly, the consumption of organically produced meat may not diminish carcinogenic risk from persistent organic pollutants, and may even augment risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful and judicious use of pesticides permits a more abundant food supply.

The few studies that have focused specifically on pesticide exposure of children in utero indicate that OP pesticides are transferred to the developing fetus during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/8,83-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,83-86</a>]. </p><p>Large prospective studies have examined the causal relationship between exposure to dietary pesticides and adverse neurodevelopmental health outcomes in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a birth cohort in Taiwan, the children were evaluated at four time points between 2 and 12 years of age for prenatal and childhood exposure to seven phthalate esters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-II) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III and IV (WISC-III and IV). An inverse association was found between IQ scores and phthalate exposure during childhood, but not for exposure during the prenatal period. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a French birth cohort study of 231 mothers and their six-year-old children, prenatal and child urinary dialkyl phosphate (DAP) and dimethyl phosphate (DM) metabolites were not associated with the children's overall WISC-IV scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

In one study of an urban cohort of pregnant women and newborns in Manhattan, measurements of OP pesticides (chlorpyrifos and diazinon) were inversely associated with both birth weight and length prior to 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>]. The adverse association between OP exposure and fetal growth disappeared within a year of the EPA regulatory action to phase out these pesticides. Conversely, in a birth cohort in California, maternal organochlorine exposure was not associated with birth weight, length, or length of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>Women living in agricultural communities appear to have higher levels of exposure to pesticides. Urinary metabolites of OP pesticides were measured during pregnancy and after delivery in 600 women residing in an agricultural community in California [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Metabolite levels during pregnancy and postpartum were higher in this population than in a sample of women of childbearing age in the general US population. The differences were more pronounced at the post-partum measurement, when levels were 2.5 times higher than in the reference population. These findings may have implications for estimating dose of exposure during pregnancy and lactation.</p><p>There is some evidence supporting an association between OP exposure and alterations in neonatal neurobehavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. In the cohort described above, neonatal neurobehavior was assessed with the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (BNBAS), and in utero and early postnatal OP exposure was measured by urinary OP metabolites. The study revealed a correlation between prenatal urinary metabolite levels and abnormal reflexes in the infants. However, no detrimental associations were found between postnatal urinary metabolite levels and any of the neurodevelopmental measures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Exposure in childhood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most evidence indicates that traces of pesticide residues in foods are not a problem for most people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. However, data are limited regarding the toxicologic consequences of exposure to pesticide residue during infancy and early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>Children who live in agricultural settings may be exposed to higher levels of OP pesticides than their urban counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/96-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-100</a>]. Children of farm workers may be exposed to pesticides tracked into their homes by household members, by pesticide drift, by playing in contaminated areas, or through breast milk from their farm worker mother [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/80,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,101</a>]. Researchers in Washington State found that the median metabolite pesticide levels in 109 preschool children of agricultural workers were five times higher than in those in a reference population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Studies are examining the effectiveness of interventions to reduce pesticide exposure to this population, including education of parents in pesticide safety and to remove contaminated shoes and clothing before entering the home, and to keep children away from pesticide-treated areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/98,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,103</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Pesticide regulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of pesticide is regulated strictly by three federal agencies: the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>The EPA establishes a tolerance for all pesticides that are registered and approved for use in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Tolerance is defined as the legal limit of a pesticide residue allowed in or on a raw agricultural commodity and, in appropriate cases, on processed foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The pesticide tolerance for various crops or chemicals can be obtained from the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/food/viewtols.htm&amp;token=dTBOilJYMbf5xmv0T7a65WC/EqhNWMhUPrPLA4ojUYGGOdesNFCUxQ+GhiTAP3ejvdzMKrgv6aGEcKx3Re16Bg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5362\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">EPA's Web site</a>:</p><p>The EPA uses toxicity data from animal studies that attempt to mimic human exposure (eg, continuous low-level ingestion) to determine tolerance levels.

Examples for which consideration for the health of infants and children affected decisions include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tolerances for the pesticide pydrin on alfalfa and sorghum were not approved in 1985 because of concern regarding risks to children from secondary residues in milk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The EPA limited the use of two organophosphate pesticides, methyl parathion and azinphos methyl, in 1999.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another organophosphate pesticide, chlorpyrifos (Dursban), was banned in 2000.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2001, the EPA began to phase out diazinon, one of the most widely used organophosphate pesticides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].</p><p/><p>In 1993, the National Research Council (NRC) issued a report on pesticides in the diets of infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The report concluded that children may be exposed to relatively larger amounts of certain pesticide residues than are adults and that the exposure occurs at a vulnerable point in their development. It acknowledged the need for reassessment of pesticide tolerances that would apply specifically to infants and children and recommended the collection of data that would more accurately reflect the dietary patterns of children and the effects of pesticide exposure in infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/75,77,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,77,95</a>].</p><p>The NRC report triggered passage of the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) in 1996. The FQPA required the EPA to review and reassess all existing pesticide tolerances to make them safer for infants and children by 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/109,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">109,110</a>]. The FQPA required the EPA to apply an additional 10-fold margin of safety to its pesticide assessments to address the potential for pre- and postnatal toxicity and to compensate for gaps or inadequacies in the available database regarding potential health risks to infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/111-113\" class=\"abstract_t\">111-113</a>]. The EPA is required to apply the 10-fold safety factor unless there are reliable data to support use of a different safety factor to protect infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/77,112,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,112,114</a>].</p><p>As of August 3, 2006, the EPA had completed 9637, or more than 99 percent, of the planned tolerance reassessments; the remaining tolerance reassessment cases were completed in September, 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. The tolerance reassessment process has led to EPA decisions to revoke or modify thousands of existing tolerances (3200 and 1200, respectively), and to require the establishment of many new tolerances, improving food safety and health protection. The new tolerances also ensure that pesticides used on foods meet the stringent FQPA safety standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p>Tolerance levels are enforced by the USDA for meat and poultry and by the FDA for all other foods. The FDA specifically analyzes for pesticide residues on all foods eaten by infants and children. As an example, pesticide residues on apples, bananas, oranges, pears, grape and orange juice, and milk were monitored by the FDA between 1985 and 1991 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/104,117,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,117,118</a>]. More than 10,000 food samples were analyzed before processing and without washing or peeling. Fifty samples (0.5 percent) were in violation (0.3 percent of domestic products and 0.6 percent of imports). The majority of these violations occurred because the pesticide was not approved for use on that particular food.</p><p>The FDA monitors nutritional concerns, including pesticide exposure, through the Total Diet Study. This study examines 234 foods selected to typify the American diet. Between 1985 and 1991, analysis of these foods revealed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No residues were found in infant formulas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No residues over the EPA tolerance or FDA action level were found in any of the &quot;market basket&quot; foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malathion-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">malathion</a> were found in some cereals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low levels of thiabendazole, a post-harvest fungicide, were found on some fruits and fruit products.</p><p/><p>The Total Diet Study findings for 2003 were consistent with previous FDA reports in that pesticide residues were below regulatory standards. An adjunct survey of baby foods also provided evidence of only small amounts of pesticide residues between 1991 and 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduction of exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most pesticides begin to break down soon after application with exposure to sunlight and rain; they continue to break down after harvest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Additional pesticide reduction can be achieved through washing, peeling, cooking, or processing of foodstuffs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>As an example, in the FDA monitoring described above, the highest residue level of the fungicide thiabendazole in raw apples was 2 parts per million (ppm), in apple juice was 0.08 ppm, and in applesauce was 0.06 ppm. The established tolerance is 10 ppm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>Canned or frozen fruits and vegetables are alternatives to fresh fruits and vegetables for individuals concerned about pesticide residues. Most food preservation techniques minimize the loss of nutritive value and are safe and well-standardized. One comparative analysis of fresh, frozen, and canned vegetables conducted by the University of Illinois found that canned foods are nutritionally equivalent to their fresh and frozen counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].</p><p>Organic diets appear to reduce OP exposure in children. In one study of a group of 39 preschool-aged children in Washington State, children consuming a conventional diet had urinary dimethyl OP metabolites six to nine times higher than children consuming an organic diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. In another study, the short-term effects of changing to an organic diet were measured in 23 school-aged children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. After only 24 to 48 hours of the organic diet, urinary OP metabolites (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=malathion-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">malathion</a> and chlorpyrifos) decreased to nondetectable levels.

Studies show that conventional milk does not contain significantly higher levels of bovine growth hormone (GH) compared with organic milk. In addition, 90 percent of bovine GH is destroyed by pasteurization. Bovine GH is biologically inactive in humans, so even if it were absorbed from drinking conventional milk, it would not be expected to cause adverse health effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex steroids &ndash; Treatment of cattle with sex-steroids accelerates the rate of growth, an efficient way to increase meat yield. It has been postulated that ingested estrogen in food derived from sex-hormone-treated animals may lead to earlier development of puberty. Limited studies have not supported this hypothesis in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/25,124\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,124</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; On conventional livestock farms, antibiotics are administered in nontherapeutic doses to enhance growth and prevent disease. Many of these antibiotics are identical or similar to antibiotic drugs given to humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. One review suggests that the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in non-organic foods may be related to the routine use of antibiotics. Organic farming that prohibits the use of non-therapeutic antibiotics may contribute to a reduction in disease caused by drug-resistant organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-foods-and-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Organically grown&quot; refers to the methods used to grow and process agricultural products (eg, fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, and poultry) and is not related to nutritional quality or food safety. Factors to consider when deciding whether to use organic products include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nutrition</strong> &ndash; There is little evidence that organic foods have higher nutritional quality than conventionally-produced foods. Both organic and conventional farming supply nutritious foods when selected as part of a well-balanced diet, which should be rich in fruits and vegetables.
