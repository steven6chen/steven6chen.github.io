Restoration of sinus rhythm improves symptoms and decreases the risk of embolization if recurrence does not occur.

Causes of atrial flutter, rate control therapy, the maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion, and the role of anticoagulation in atrial flutter are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-atrial-and-atrioventricular-nodal-supraventricular-arrhythmias#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Atrial and atrioventricular nodal (supraventricular) arrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial flutter&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In the absence of rate slowing drugs or atrioventricular (AV) nodal disease, every other beat passes through the AV node and the ventricular rate is usually around 150 beats per minute. Because of the rapid rate, the patient may present with symptoms of palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness, and rarely hemodynamic shock, similar to patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodynamic-consequences-of-atrial-fibrillation-and-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;, section on 'Adverse hemodynamics in AF'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to improving symptoms, the restoration of sinus rhythm prevents the potential for the development of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy and reduces the risk of systemic embolization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter#H458946394\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolic risk and the role of anticoagulation in atrial flutter&quot;, section on 'Embolic risk'</a>.)</p><p>Atrial flutter is often an electrically unstable rhythm, meaning that it frequently degenerates into the more disorganized atrial fibrillation (AF) or reverts to sinus rhythm within hours or days. Spontaneous reversion to a sinus mechanism may occur after predisposing problems are improved, such as decompensated heart failure (HF) or the sequelae of cardiac surgery. In addition, chronic atrial flutter is uncommon. For these reasons, cardioversion is less commonly needed if the patient is rate controlled and can tolerate the arrhythmia. </p><p>In patients who do not spontaneously convert to sinus rhythm, rate slowing with drugs may be considered a therapeutic option. The ventricular rate is frequently difficult to control, however, as most medications are ineffective for rate slowing and for many patients it is not worth attempting as a long-term alternative to rhythm control. Rate control may be appropriate for patients who are reluctant to undergo cardioversion or who have no or minimal symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial flutter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For those patients in whom a decision has been made to restore sinus rhythm, most can be cardioverted successfully without complication. Factors that predict spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm or a successful cardioversion are similar to those for AF, and include a left atrial size less than 4.5 to 5 cm, little or no heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, no underlying reversible cause such as hyperthyroidism, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism, and atrial flutter of recent onset. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm#H166080599\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;, section on 'Reasons to not cardiovert'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with atrial flutter who do not undergo spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm should undergo cardioversion. The following are indications for urgent cardioversion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with atrial flutter who have a ventricular rate of &ge;150 beats per minute and who have significant hemodynamic compromise (hypotension or heart failure) should undergo urgent cardioversion. In patients with atrial flutter and hemodynamic compromise, but with a controlled ventricular rate (eg, &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min),</span> explanations for hemodynamic instability other than the atrial flutter should be sought. Restoration of sinus rhythm in these patients may not necessarily improve the clinical status. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with atrial flutter who are identified as having an accessory pathway with ventricular preexcitation should undergo immediate cardioversion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome#H8471426\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome&quot;, section on 'Atrial flutter'</a>.) </p><p/><p>For patients with minimal symptoms or signs attributable to atrial flutter, conversion to sinus rhythm may be deferred in anticipation of either spontaneous conversion or radiofrequency catheter ablation. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Radiofrequency catheter ablation'</a> below.) </p><p>Among those patients who are not urgently cardioverted and who do not spontaneously revert to sinus rhythm, elective restoration of sinus rhythm is favored to decrease the risk of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H88528146\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above.) This is in contrast to atrial fibrillation (AF), in which tolerance of permanent AF may be more likely chosen since rate control is usually possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-flutter#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial flutter&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>Circumstances in which it is reasonable to avoid cardioversion in patients with new onset atrial flutter include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are completely asymptomatic, particularly those who are elderly (&gt;80 years) with multiple comorbidities or poor overall prognosis, where the risks of undergoing cardioversion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pharmacologic rhythm control may outweigh the benefits of restoring sinus rhythm. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have a bleeding risk and cannot be anticoagulated during the peri-cardioversion and post-cardioversion periods. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2682662\"><span class=\"h1\">METHOD OF CARDIOVERSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients in whom a decision is made to restore sinus rhythm urgently, we prefer electrical to pharmacologic cardioversion. Radiofrequency catheter ablation is an option for stable patients who can wait until this procedure can be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrical Cardioversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrical cardioversion, also called direct current (DC) cardioversion, has become a routine procedure in the management of patients with cardiac arrhythmias. It is the preferred means for the immediate restoration of sinus rhythm. With appropriate patient selection and technique, DC cardioversion is rapid and safe. The success rate of 96 to 97 percent is higher than for any antiarrhythmic drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic cardioversion'</a> below.) </p><p>Electrical cardioversion should be performed by physicians experienced in the procedure. The patient should be fasting to allow for safe use of sedation, serum electrolytes should be normal, and drug levels, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, should be within the therapeutic range. Cardioversion techniques are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of electrical cardioversion and defibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is expected that normal sinus rhythm will resume once the atrial flutter terminates. Sometimes, atrial fibrillation, ectopic atrial rhythm, or a significant bradycardia may result. The approach to each of these is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temporary-cardiac-pacing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Temporary cardiac pacing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28313518\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacologic enhancement of direct current cardioversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the success of DC cardioversion is high for atrial flutter, antiarrhythmic drugs may be initiated prior to electrical cardioversion to increase the likelihood of successful cardioversion and long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm#H8701669\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs'</a>.) </p><p>The decision to pretreat is often made by a physician experienced with the care of patients with one or more risk factors for cardioversion failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm#H166080599\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;, section on 'Reasons to not cardiovert'</a>.) The antiarrhythmic drug may restore sinus rhythm prior to DC cardioversion in some cases or may help prevent recurrent episodes of atrial flutter early after cardioversion. In addition, for patients in whom long-term antiarrhythmic therapy will be used, early initiation (prior to DC cardioversion) may allow for an evaluation of tolerability of one or more drugs. For those patients in whom a decision has been made to attempt the long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drug therapy, it is reasonable to preferentially select a drug for cardioversion that can also be used for long-term maintenance. Based on these considerations, we use pharmacologic enhancement in selected patients, such as those in whom ablation will not be performed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic cardioversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of antiarrhythmic drugs may be used to terminate atrial flutter and restore sinus rhythm. However, antiarrhythmic drugs are less effective than DC cardioversion and carry some degree of proarrhythmic risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amiodarone: Monitoring and management of side effects&quot;, section on 'Ventricular arrhythmias'</a>.) Thus, pharmacologic cardioversion is generally reserved for selected clinical scenarios. The most common reason for selecting pharmacologic cardioversion is that moderate or deep sedation is either unavailable or is expected to be poorly tolerated (for example, as in patients with hypotension).</p><p>Most of the available data on the efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs for the restoration of sinus rhythm are from patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The drugs that are effective in converting AF to sinus rhythm may also be effective in converting atrial flutter. These include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>. Ibutilide and dofetilide have been better studied than the other drugs discussed below.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-use-of-ibutilide\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic use of ibutilide&quot;</a>.) <br/><br/>The most serious concern with ibutilide is QT interval prolongation that can lead to torsades de pointes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The potential for torsades de pointes is increased in patients with severe heart failure or those who are being treated with another drug that prolongs the QT interval. On the other hand, the risk of proarrhythmia does not appear to be increased when ibutilide is given with amiodarone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Because of the risk of torsades de pointes, patients treated with ibutilide should be observed with continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for at least four hours after the infusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-use-of-ibutilide#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic use of ibutilide&quot;, section on 'Proarrhythmia'</a>.) The addition of intravenous magnesium, in doses of 4 to 10 grams, can enhance the cardioverting effect of ibutilide and may reduce the risk of torsades de pointes as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dofetilide</a> - Oral dofetilide is effective for conversion of atrial flutter and the conversion rate appears to be higher than in AF.

Conversion to sinus rhythm occurred in 70 percent within 24 hours, while 91 percent converted within 36 hours. <br/><br/>Dofetilide has the disadvantage of requiring the patient to be hospitalized for the first six doses, as it can cause nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, torsade de pointes, or sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-flutter/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].<br/><br/>Intravenous dofetilide, which is not available in the United States, also appears to be effective for conversion of atrial flutter.
