In patients with known COPD, uncontrolled dyspnea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest tightness could be due to refractory COPD or concomitant CHD. Due to the frequent co-existence of these diseases and the potential diagnostic uncertainty of the symptoms, physicians caring for patients with COPD need to have a low threshold for performing additional diagnostic testing to identify CHD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1797408178\"><span class=\"h2\">Myocardial ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since exacerbations of both COPD and CHD are often signaled by dyspnea, patients and clinicians may find it challenging to know which disease requires urgent treatment. Classic symptoms of a COPD flare (eg, dyspnea, cough, wheezing, and change in sputum) may point correctly to the lung, while new electrocardiographic signs of ischemia may prove that the heart is the culprit. Alternatively, both organ systems may be involved and difficult to distinguish. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with dyspnea in the emergency department&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For ambulatory patients with COPD and symptoms that could be attributable to myocardial ischemia, we typically perform a baseline electrocardiogram and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress imaging, as exercise limitations may preclude exercise stress testing, and potential bronchoconstriction is often a contraindication to vasodilator radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging.

Among 242 patients admitted for an exacerbation of COPD, 24 had a raised troponin and 20 had chest pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serial electrocardiogram (ECG) changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-patient-with-copd-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, neither chest pain nor serial ECG changes were statistically associated with elevated troponin, suggesting that a raised troponin in the context of a COPD exacerbation is not necessarily indicative of myocardial injury. In a separate study, highly sensitive cardiac troponin (hs-cTnT) was measured in 50 patients admitted with an acute exacerbation of COPD and 124 stable patients in a pulmonary rehabilitation hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-patient-with-copd-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The ratio of hs-cTnT in those with a COPD exacerbation was significantly higher than those with stable COPD, ratio 5.67 (95% CI 4.0-7.86). However, the specific determinants of hs-cTnT elevation were unclear, as neither hypoxic vasoconstriction nor underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) were statistically associated with the increase in hs-cTnT.

The frequency of undiagnosed heart failure among ambulatory patients was examined in a cross-sectional study of 244 older adults with COPD based on the initial Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82690 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-patient-with-copd-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Previously unrecognized heart failure was identified in 21 percent, and ischemic heart disease was judged to be the most common cause of heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging#H263049556\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p>Similarly, for patients presenting to the hospital, symptoms of an exacerbation of COPD overlap with acute worsening of heart failure. In a study examining the ability of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP) and troponin T to differentiate an acute exacerbation of COPD from left heart dysfunction, 46 of the 148 patients (31 percent) were judged to have both a COPD exacerbation and heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-patient-with-copd-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Thus, we have a low threshold to obtaining an echocardiogram and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP or N-terminal pro-BNP) in patients with a COPD exacerbation to make sure heart failure is not overlooked. However, caution is needed in the evaluation of <span class=\"nowrap\">BNP/NT-proBNP</span> results in patients with severe COPD, as pulmonary hypertension can lead to an elevated BNP. In some patients a chest radiograph can help identify heart failure, but bullous emphysema can lead to an atypical appearance of heart failure.

The risk of coronary events (eg, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, admission to the hospital for CVD events) is lower among users of nicotine replacement than placebo. The issue of whether nicotine replacement can be started during a hospitalization for myocardial infarction has not been well studied, but cautious initiation during the hospitalization or at the time of discharge is thought to be reasonable. The use of nicotine replacement in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or acute myocardial infarction is discussed separately.

Mild or brief hypoxemia appears to be unimportant. This was illustrated in a study of 38 patients with ST depression on cardiac stress testing in whom three minutes of breathing a hypoxic mixture to produce an arterial oxygen saturation of 85 percent did not amplify the electrocardiographic signs of ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-patient-with-copd-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Myocardial ischemia appears more likely to worsen when the duration of hypoxemia is longer than five minutes or the degree of hypoxemia is severe (pulse oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] &lt;85 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-patient-with-copd-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Hypoxemia may also increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. A high incidence of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmia, particularly multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), has been described in patients with COPD with either stable disease or an acute exacerbation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-patient-with-copd-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

Supplemental oxygen therapy can also relieve hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and reverse tissue hypoxia. The enhanced oxygen content of arterial blood maintains total body oxygen delivery and allows the cardiac output to fall, reducing left ventricular work. This latter effect is probably one of the reasons that long-term supplemental oxygen improves survival in patients with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-patient-with-copd-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term supplemental oxygen therapy&quot;, section on 'Benefits'</a>.) </p><p>Interestingly, the benefit of oxygen in patients with moderate resting desaturation (89 to 93 percent) has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-patient-with-copd-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In this study of 738 patients randomized to receive supplemental oxygen or no supplemental oxygen, there were no differences in time to death or first hospitalization.</p><p>It is possible that higher than usual arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) may confer additional benefit in patients with ongoing myocardial ischemia.

Although often well tolerated, these higher fractions of inspired oxygen can lead to exacerbation of hypercapnia in patients with COPD and are not usually given clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-patient-with-copd-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].
