It happens most often in older women. It is often triggered by intense physical or emotional stress such as a sudden medical illness, the death of a loved one, or an argument. This condition is also sometimes called &quot;stress-induced cardiomyopathy,&quot; &quot;broken heart syndrome,&quot; or &quot;takotsubo cardiomyopathy.&quot;</p><p>In stress cardiomyopathy, part of the heart stops working normally so the heart doesn't pump well. In most cases, the lower end of the heart, called the &quot;apex,&quot; is involved. When this happens, this part of the heart gets bigger. Because of this, stress cardiomyopathy is sometimes called &quot;apical ballooning syndrome.&quot;</p><p>Even though this condition causes similar symptoms as a heart attack, it is different from a heart attack. A heart attack happens most often in people with coronary heart disease (also called coronary artery disease). In a heart attack, one of the arteries that supply blood to the heart gets blocked. This causes part of the heart muscle to be damaged.</p><p>People with stress cardiomyopathy do not usually have coronary heart disease.</p><p>Stress cardiomyopathy is usually not long-lasting. Most people get completely better in 1 to 4 weeks. But sometimes stress cardiomyopathy leads to serious heart problems, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure, which is a condition in which the heart does not pump well</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart rhythm problems that cause the heart to beat much faster or slower than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart valve problems</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263660475\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of stress cardiomyopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptom is sudden chest pain. Some people have trouble breathing or faint (pass out).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263660490\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. Because the symptoms of stress cardiomyopathy are the same as those of a heart attack, your doctor will order tests to find out what's causing your symptoms.</p><p>These tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; With stress cardiomyopathy, the heart releases certain chemicals. Blood tests can show whether these chemicals are in your blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray &ndash; This can show if there is fluid in the lungs. It also shows the general shape of the heart and large blood vessels in the chest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in the heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;) &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart as it beats (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac catheterization (also called &ldquo;cardiac cath&rdquo;) &ndash; During this test, the doctor puts a thin tube called a catheter into a blood vessel in your leg or arm. Then he or she moves the tube up to your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77943\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77943 \">figure 3</a>). When the tube is in your heart or blood vessels, he or she will take measurements. The doctor might also put a dye into a tube that shows up on an X-ray. This part of the test is called &quot;coronary angiography.&quot; It can show if any of the arteries in your heart are narrowed or blocked.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263660574\"><span class=\"h1\">How is stress cardiomyopathy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people are treated with medicines. Your doctor can prescribe different heart medicines, depending on your symptoms and the problems caused by your cardiomyopathy.</p><p>People usually take these medicines for a short time only, until their condition improves. But some people need to take medicines for the rest of their life.</p><p>Most people with stress cardiomyopathy get better within 1 to 4 weeks and do not get this condition again. But some people who have had stress cardiomyopathy get the condition again. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263660589\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-catheterization-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cardiac catheterization (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-tachycardia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ventricular tachycardia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradycardia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bradycardia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chest pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart attack (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
