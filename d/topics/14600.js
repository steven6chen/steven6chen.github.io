(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-treating-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to treating generalized anxiety disorder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3450346188\"><span class=\"h1\">COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673079\"><span class=\"h2\">Theoretical foundation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is based on evidence that shows that persons with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) engage in overestimations and catastrophizing of negative events; show limited confidence in problem solving; require additional evidence before making decisions; have a low tolerance of uncertainty, an iterative problem-solving style, worry about worry, and numerous behavioral and cognitive strategies that may actually be counterproductive and help maintain the self-perpetuating cycle of worry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In particular, GAD is associated with judgment biases and attentional biases, such as a tendency to interpret ambiguous situations in a threatening manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], overestimate the likelihood of negative events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and over-attend to threatening stimuli, even when the stimuli are not consciously perceived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The automaticity of this pre-attentive bias is likely to lead to the experience of worry and anxiety as being intrusive.</p><p>GAD is also associated with avoidance behaviors, including excessive preparation (eg, getting to an appointment an hour beforehand to avoid being late), checking behaviors (eg, making sure the children are safe when sleeping), and procrastination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These behaviors are believed to reinforce anxiety and propagate the cycle of worry. In addition, persons with GAD may attempt to control worry by distraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The relief from distraction, however, is likely to be short-lived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>], and attempts to deliberately suppress worry may serve to automatically prime the worry thoughts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Worry may function as an avoidance behavior in and of itself, and in particular, avoidance of fearful imagery and autonomic arousal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The largely verbal, left-hemispheric act of worry is far less autonomically arousing than right-hemispheric, pictorial processing (eg, worrying about children&rsquo;s safety versus picturing them dead in a car accident) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Verbal or linguistic processing of threat is associated with weaker negative affect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and less autonomic reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] than imagery based processing of the same threat. Also, chronic worry or GAD is associated with sustained restriction of autonomic reactivity, or less variation in autonomic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. By suppressing catastrophic imagery and associated autonomic activation, worry inhibits access to underlying fear. In other words, worry becomes a form of avoidance of fear. Catastrophic images are presumed to continue to emerge periodically, in turn motivating continued cognitive avoidance in the form of worry. As a result of this negative reinforcement cycle, pre-attentive biases towards threat and further catastrophic images, with the associated drive to shift to worry in order to avoid them, are reinforced. </p><p>Another characteristic of GAD is low confidence in problem-solving abilities, partially due to worries over making the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; decision. Patients with GAD prefer to acquire as much evidence as possible before making decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], have a low tolerance for ambiguity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and engage in an iterative style of problem solving (ie, generating all possible negative outcomes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] compared with nonanxious controls. Such behavioral patterns contribute to distress over decision making and general anxiety. This is compounded by the effects of continuous worry upon ability to concentrate (eg, at work), thereby impairing performance and providing additional sources of worry. </p><p>Positive and negative metacognitive beliefs about worry promote further worry and rumination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Positive beliefs refer to the positive value of worrying in order to reach solutions or prevent negative events from occurring. Negative beliefs that worrying is uncontrollable and harmful (ie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of control to worry this excessively&rdquo;) appear to more strongly predict pathological worry compared with positive beliefs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], presumably because the negative beliefs generate worry about worry, attempts to suppress further worry, avoidance behaviors, and reassurance seeking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>CBT addresses the various cognitive, behavioral, and physiological features of GAD through a number of strategies. First, overestimations and catastrophizing of negative events are addressed through cognitive skills that encourage evidence-based thinking, which in turn is believed to lessen attentional biases to threat. Deficits in problem solving are targeted through additional cognitive skills that encourage a problem-coping focus, as well as behavioral skills for enhanced decision making and time management. Behavioral practices aim to reduce excessive checking, procrastination, and other &lsquo;worry&rsquo; behaviors, and often include repeated exposure to anxiety-provoking situations. In addition, through repeated exposure to catastrophic images, the emotional response and autonomic arousal subsides, which in turn reduces the drive to shift to excessive worry to avoid such images. Finally, progressive muscle relaxation aims to reduce excessive muscle tension and vigilance to threat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673086\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals for whom CBT works best are generally highly motivated and value a problem-solving approach. CBT requires that the patient learns the skills of self-observation and of becoming a personal scientist, cognitive and behavioral coping skills, and to repeatedly practice the skills in anxiety-provoking contexts outside of the therapy setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>It is unclear whether CBT is better suited to individuals from certain cultures. CBT as a general approach is heavily aligned with Europe and North American values of an individual&rsquo;s capacity for change, open self-disclosure, independence, autonomy, and rational thinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Such values often are at odds with values of harmony, family, and spirituality that are deeply embedded in Asian, Latino, Arabic, African American, and other cultures, which might imply that CBT would be less effective in such populations. However, evidence suggests that CBT for anxiety (although not specifically for GAD) can be effective with Latino and African American groups. Adaptation of the therapy to other cultures has been attempted (eg, greater involvement of family members), but the impact of these modifications is not well understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Exposure to anxiety-producing situations may be contraindicated for persons with dementia, psychosis, and other thought disorders.</p><p>In patients with medical conditions potentially exacerbated by high levels of autonomic arousal (eg, certain arrhythmias or high blood pressure), a more graduated approach may be preferable to intensive exposure, with ongoing monitoring of medical status. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673093\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An in-depth, structured interview is the first step in establishing diagnostic features and details of associated behaviors (eg, decision-making difficulties) in preparation for psychotherapy. An instrument such as the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] can be used to collect data on the domains of worry as well as GAD physical symptoms. Such information is particularly helpful for tailoring treatment. As an example, details about the domains of worry will inform the content of cognitive restructuring. </p><p>The most useful standardized self-report inventory is the GAD-7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], which is a brief scale of frequency of cognitive and somatic symptoms of GAD. Other scales, listed below, provide useful information for treatment planning and are sensitive markers of therapeutic change:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penn State Worry Questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] measures the excessiveness and uncontrollable nature of worry. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worry Domains Questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] assesses the amount of worry across five domains of everyday concern: relationships, lack of confidence, aimless future, work, and financial issues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metacognitions Questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>] measures individual differences in a selection of metacognitive beliefs, judgments, and monitoring tendencies involving cognitive confidence, positive beliefs about worry, cognitive self-consciousness, negative beliefs about uncontrollability of thoughts and danger, and beliefs about need to control thoughts.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673100\"><span class=\"h2\">Principles of practice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The central focus of CBT for GAD is teaching patients a set of cognitive and somatic coping skills to effectively manage their anxiety as they are repeatedly exposed to anxiety provoking images and activities. More specifically, patients are taught to become personal observers of their anxiety and worry. They learn to implement skills of cognitive restructuring to replace catastrophic appraisals with more evidence-based and coping oriented appraisals. They learn techniques of relaxation training to control excessive levels of tension. Then, patients are encouraged to apply the cognitive and relaxation skills during exposures to images of feared negative events, and to anxiety-provoking situations, as they prevent themselves from engaging in overt and subtle avoidance behaviors. </p><p>Symptoms of GAD that CBT addresses are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive symptoms of excessive and uncontrollable worry about a number of different life domains</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical symptoms of motor tension, vigilance, restlessness, inability to relax, poor sleep, and poor concentration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral symptoms of excessive preparation, procrastination, poor decision making, and avoidance </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673107\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBT is a multimodal intervention for GAD, including patient education, self-monitoring, relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, imagery exposure, exposure to anxiety provoking situations, and relapse prevention. These techniques are described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673114\"><span class=\"h3\">Education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment begins with education on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Informing and correcting misconceptions regarding anxiety, worry, and associated symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causative factors of pathological worry and anxiety</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A model of factors that perpetuate GAD</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment plan and rationale (ie, symptoms of GAD will subside by using evidence-based and coping oriented thinking, by dealing directly with anxiety provoking images and situations, and by learning to relax) </p><p/><p>Much of this information is integrated in presenting how a pathological cycle of worry and anxiety develops and is maintained in patients&rsquo; lives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673121\"><span class=\"h3\">Self-monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Self-monitoring is introduced in the first treatment session and continues throughout the entire treatment. Learning to observe their reactions from an objective standpoint encourages the patient&rsquo;s development as a personal scientist and increases his or her accuracy in self-observation. Self-monitoring allows patients to chart their progress in therapy. </p><p>Patients keep track of significant episodes of worry on a Worry Record (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F83340\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef83340 \">form 1</a>) to be completed as soon as possible during or after each worry episode. The record provides a description of the cues, maximal distress, and symptoms, thoughts, and behaviors. Patients additionally complete a daily mood record at the end of each day to record overall or average levels of anxiety. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673128\"><span class=\"h3\">Relaxation training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relaxation training can be particularly meaningful for GAD patients as they often experience elevated muscle tension and reduced flexibility of autonomic functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Relaxation training consists of progressive muscle relaxation (after brief deliberate tension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] of all muscle groups of the body in a systematic manner, beginning with 16 muscle groups, and then condensing to 8 muscle groups, and 4 muscle groups. </p><p>Relaxation training ends with cue-control relaxation, where patients cue themselves to relax by simply repeating a word (such as &ldquo;relax&rdquo;) that has been repeatedly paired with relaxation phases during the preceding weeks of progressive muscle relaxation training. Cue-control relaxation is then used as a coping skill for practicing exposure to anxiety-producing images or situations (also referred to as &ldquo;applied relaxation&rdquo;). Breathing exercises, such as slow, diaphragmatic breathing, may be incorporated into relaxation training.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673135\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive restructuring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive restructuring is a set of skills for identifying and modifying misappraisals that contribute to anxiety, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are shown how anxiety and maladaptive behaviors are generated by overly-negative interpretations of events. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are helped to identify errors in thinking (eg, overestimating the probability or valence of negative events) and rigid rules or beliefs that underlie dysfunctional thought patterns. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are encouraged to use an empirical approach to examine the validity of thoughts by considering all of the available evidence. </p><p/><p>Therapists use Socratic questioning to help patients make guided discoveries and question their anxious thinking. Patients then generate alternative interpretations or &ldquo;hypotheses&rdquo; to situations with the help of additional evidence gathered in behavioral practices in anxiety-provoking situations. As an example, a person who typically avoided taking on new responsibilities due to worries about making mistakes was encouraged to take on new responsibilities, to gather evidence on what happens subsequently. He or she learned that mistakes were less frequent than anticipated and did not have negative consequences. Underlying beliefs (eg, &ldquo;I am incompetent&rdquo;) are postulated to change with the patient&rsquo;s accrual of evidence that challenges his or her negative thoughts. </p><p>Cognitive bias modification programs have been developed using paradigms initially developed to assess biases in attention (ie, dot probe) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In the modification programs, individuals are trained to attend to neutral (instead of negative) words or images, or are trained to develop less negative interpretations of ambiguous material. However, effect sizes are relatively small and from the most recent meta-analysis, become nonsignificant when outliers are excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673142\"><span class=\"h3\">Imagery exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imagery exposure is designed to help patients tolerate negative affect and autonomic arousal associated with fearful images that they often attempt to avoid through worry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Patients generate hierarchies of fear images related to two or three main areas of worry and are led through systematic exposure to these images. When anxiety elicited by an image is reduced to a mild level, then patients progress to the next image on the hierarchy. </p><p>Two main versions of imagery exposure have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one version, patients imagine a worst case scenario for 25 to 30 minutes, after which they generate alternative outcomes to the scenario. This approach has been shown to be effective for GAD as a standalone treatment in a small randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second version, self-controlled desensitization, involves utilization of cognitive restructuring and relaxation skills during imagery exposure to anxiety-provoking situations. It has been incorporated into CBT in a number of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673149\"><span class=\"h3\">Exposure to anxiety-provoking situations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This technique involves repeated exposure to situations that are avoided or engaged in with excessive preparation or checking. Patients generate a hierarchy of situations or activities. Examples include allowing children to have sleep overs, family vacations, arriving on time (instead of excessively early) at scheduled appointments, taking on responsibilities, or saying &lsquo;no&rsquo; to requests. Patients rehearse cognitive restructuring and relaxation coping skills in session. Subsequently, they practice using these techniques to manage anxiety in situations that occur between sessions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673156\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other techniques that may be incorporated into CBT for GAD include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problem-solving to combat indecisiveness and increase the ability to generate alternative solutions to problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time management training and goal setting to facilitate present task accomplishment instead of allowing worry to dominate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673163\"><span class=\"h3\">Relapse prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A final step in CBT is relapse prevention, in which patients are informed that recurrences of worry, anxiety or avoidance behavior are likely to occur in the future. They are encouraged to view such recurrences as lapses rather than failure, and to reapply their coping skills and reinstitute their practice of exposure to images of negative outcomes and anxiety-provoking situations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15673170\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple clinical trials have found CBT to effectively reduce GAD symptoms compared with control conditions and with other psychotherapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/10,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,13</a>].
