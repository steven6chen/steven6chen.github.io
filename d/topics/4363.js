Many patients with anxiety disorders find conventional (Western) mental health care treatments to be insufficiently helpful and turn to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as an adjunct or substitute.</p><p>Epidemiologic studies suggest that 30 to 43 percent of patients treated in primary care for anxiety use CAM remedies as at least part of their treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Clinicians would be well prepared to know about efficacy and safety of CAM treatments available for anxiety disorders.</p><p>Herbal remedies and dietary supplements used as complementary and alternative medical treatments for anxiety symptoms and disorders are described here. Complementary and alternative treatments involving physical, cognitive, or spiritual activities for anxiety symptoms and disorders are described separately. Herbal medicine and dietary supplements in general medical care are also described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-physical-cognitive-and-spiritual-interventions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complementary and alternative treatments for anxiety symptoms and disorders: Physical, cognitive, and spiritual interventions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of herbal medicine and dietary supplements&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109704336\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sixty-two percent of adults in the United States utilize some form of complementary and alternative medical treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; the most commonly used were mind-body therapies. Individuals diagnosed with a psychiatric illness are more prone to using these therapies, especially patients with elevated anxiety or anxiety disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], in part because many who are treated psychiatrically respond only partially to treatment and have residual symptoms and impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Among the challenges encountered with evaluating the efficacy and clinical use of herbal remedies and dietary supplements for anxiety symptoms and disorders:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rigorous clinical trials of pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders have shown rates of placebo response as high as 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Determinations of efficacy thus require well-designed trials in sufficiently sized samples. Instead, most trials have had small samples and other methodological limitations. Large-scale safety studies have been scarce and inconclusive. Interactions among different herbal remedies have received insufficient study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consumers in the United States spend billions of dollars annually on herbal remedies and dietary supplements. This has fueled aggressive marketing campaigns, with claims of safety and efficacy for anxiety. Although often sold in pharmacies, these products are not subject to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations in the United States. Preparations can vary widely in dose and in composition of extracts and alkaloids, depending on the source.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many herbal remedies are largely used as a part of complex treatment strategies within Chinese, Tibetan, or Ayurveda medical systems. Evaluating their effects as a single remedy using Western testing methods and outcome measures, while useful, is incomplete. In addition, language barriers and selective databases limit access to clinical research from other countries.</p><p/><p>Clinicians have an important role in educating patients about herbal remedies and dietary supplements. They should warn patients that the safety and efficacy of these products for anxiety symptoms and disorders is still unproven, and help them weigh the risks and benefits of using them adjunctively. Patients should be discouraged from abandoning evidence-based psychotherapies and medications for anxiety disorders. A patient&rsquo;s medical history should include what remedies and supplements they are taking, particularly those known to interact with other drugs or cause adverse effects.</p><p>In addition to describing complementary and alternative treatments for anxiety disorders, this topic includes obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which was placed into a separate category of disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis#H718079259\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Assessment and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2255826\"><span class=\"h1\">HERBAL REMEDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>None of the herbal remedies described here been shown in clinical trials to be clearly effective or ineffective for anxiety symptoms or disorders. Trials suggest that kava and chamomile may reduce anxiety in some people with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Findings from trials of valerian, passion flower, and St. John&rsquo;s wort are either mixed or negative.</p><p>Patients may wrongly equate &ldquo;herbal&rdquo; with terms such as &ldquo;good,&rdquo; &ldquo;weak,&rdquo; or &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; in evaluating these remedies. These perspectives underestimate their potential risks; some herbs can be potent, poisonous, or addictive. Potentially serious adverse effects of herbal remedies discussed here include hepatotoxicity with kava and anticoagulation with chamomile. It is not known if these remedies are safe or unsafe during pregnancy.</p><p>While the mechanisms of action for anxiety reduction for these remedies is only partially understood, available evidence for each suggests the involvement of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2255833\"><span class=\"h2\">Kava-kava</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kava-kava or kava (<em>Piper methysticum</em>) has been used for medicinal, religious, and social purposes in various cultures in the South Pacific Rim. The remedy traditionally comes from the root, which is combined with water to make an emulsion. Western phytopharmaceutical producers may use other parts of the plant to make pills, eg, stems, leaves, peelings, and bark with an ethanol or acetone solvent.</p><p>The principal active ingredients of kava remedies are called kavalactones; 15 have been identified, all with psychoactive properties. The mechanism of action is not known; research suggests a modulation of GABA activity and inhibition of noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Two meta-analyses of multiple randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/11-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-27</a>] found kava to reduce anxiety in patients with elevated symptom levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials of 380 participants with elevated anxiety symptoms found that kava extract reduced anxiety as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A) scale compared with participants receiving placebo (weighted mean difference: 3.9, 95% CI 0.1-7.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].&nbsp;Most of the trials had methodological flaws, small sample sizes, and conflicts of interest.</p><p>Side effects of kava include headaches, sedation, and sleepiness.</p><p>Numerous reports of severe hepatotoxicity and liver failure have been described in Europe and the United States, occurring within a few weeks to up to two years (average 4.5 months) following ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/30-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-36</a>]. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised that kava should be used with caution in patients with preexisting liver disease or at risk for liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Hepatotoxicity and kava are discussed in further detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatotoxicity-due-to-herbal-medications-and-dietary-supplements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatotoxicity due to herbal medications and dietary supplements&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2255840\"><span class=\"h2\">Valerian</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Valerian root (<em>Valeriana officinalis</em>), first described by Hippocrates, has sedative and anxiolytic effects. Various compounds have been detected in valerian, including alkaloids, flavonoids, and GABA. Its mechanism of action is not known, but appears to have a relationship with valerian root affinity for the GABA receptor.</p><p>Valerian was not found to reduce anxiety compared with placebo in a single small trial. A clinical trial randomly assigned 36 patients with generalized anxiety disorder to daily valerian, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. After four weeks, there were no significant differences on the HAM-A scale or in side effects between patients treated with valerian compared with placebo.</p><p>Few adverse events have been reported as a result of valerian. Consistent with its sedative properties, valerian can cause drowsiness or dizziness. The risk of respiratory depression should be considered if valerian is proposed for use in the context of multiple sedating drugs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> significant alcohol consumption. Valerian can cause abdominal pain in large doses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2255847\"><span class=\"h2\">Passion flower</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Passion flower (<em>Passiflora incarnata</em>) is traditionally used as a calming herb in the Americas and Europe. Its extract is also used as flavoring in foods and beverages.</p><p>The anxiolytic effects of passion flower are milder than for kava or valerian; it is thus most common to find passion flower marketed in combination with other herbs. A combined product, Euphytose (EUP), contains passion flower, crataegus, ballota, valerian, cola, and <em>Paullinia</em>.</p><p>Two small trials of passion flower showed mixed results. As an example, a trial of 90 patients with presurgical anxiety found that patients treated with passion flower experienced less anxiety compared with patients treated with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. EUP has not been tested in a randomized trial.</p><p>Side effects of passion flower are rare but could include drowsiness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2255854\"><span class=\"h2\">Chamomile</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chamomile (<em>Matricaria recutita</em>) has been used for thousands of years for anxiety as well as other conditions.

The mechanism of action is not known. Weak monoamine oxidase inhibiting (MAOI) properties have been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-herbs-and-medications/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>There is no evidence of efficacy for St. John&rsquo;s wort in anxiety disorders.
