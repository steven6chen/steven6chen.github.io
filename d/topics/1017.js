This study was also small with 30 and 35 patients in the levofloxacin and doxycycline arms, respectively. The mean Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) was low in each group (class II), and fewer than 15 percent of patients had a positive sputum culture. The clinical response was similar with each group (one failure in the doxycycline arm and two failures in the levofloxacin arm); however, length of stay was shorter and the total antibiotic cost was less in the doxycycline arm.</p><p>A retrospective study of empiric therapy for CAP evaluated outcomes in 858 patients who received a beta-lactam plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> versus a beta-lactam plus a macrolide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although patients in the two groups had similar PSI scores at the time of admission, a smaller proportion of patients who received doxycycline required invasive respiratory or vasopressor support than patients who received a macrolide.

In a meta-analysis that included 23 randomized trials, respiratory fluoroquinolones (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemifloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemifloxacin</a>) were more likely to result in treatment success than the combination of a beta-lactam plus a macrolide for the treatment of CAP that was mostly mild to moderate in severity (odds ratio [OR] 1.39, 95% CI 1.02-1.90) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, fluoroquinolones were more effective only in open-labeled trials but not in randomized controlled trials. Both of the groups included agents with activity against atypical bacteria (fluoroquinolones or macrolides). A review of the literature that was published after the meta-analysis that compared the use of fluoroquinolone monotherapy with the combination of a beta-lactam and a macrolide concluded that neither one of the regimens has been proven to be superior to the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>CAP-START, a randomized trial that was published after both of these studies, showed that beta-lactams were noninferior to beta-lactam&ndash;macrolide combination therapy and fluoroquinolone monotherapy in a population with a low prevalence of atypical bacterial pneumonia (2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

In September 2010, the FDA issued a safety announcement regarding an increased mortality risk associated with the use of tigecycline compared with drugs observed in a pooled analysis of 13 trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The increased risk was seen most clearly in patients treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia; however, there was no difference in mortality rate for CAP. In 2013, the FDA added a <strong>boxed warning</strong> in reaction to an analysis showing an increased risk of death in patients receiving tigecycline for FDA-approved uses, including CAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The boxed warning states that tigecycline should be reserved for use in situations when alternative agents are not suitable.<br/><br/>In the 2013 FDA analysis of 10 clinical trials conducted for FDA-approved uses (CAP, complicated skin and skin structure infections, complicated intraabdominal infections), tigecycline was associated with increased mortality compared with other antibacterial agents (2.5 versus 1.8 percent, adjusted risk difference 0.6 percent [95% CI 0.0-1.2 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Most deaths resulted from worsening infections, complications of infection, or underlying comorbidities.<br/><br/>A 2012 meta-analysis of 10 published and 3 unpublished randomized noninferiority trials also found that tigecycline was associated with an absolute mortality increase of 0.7 percent (95% CI 0.1-1.2 percent) compared with other agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In addition, tigecycline was associated with an absolute increase in noncure rate of 2.9 percent (95% CI 0.6-5.2 percent) among patients who received tigecycline. These effects were not isolated to a specific type of infection or comparator antibiotic regimen.</p><p>Two phase III randomized trials were designed to test whether intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tigecycline</a> was equivalent to intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> in patients hospitalized with CAP, the majority of whom had a PSI score of II or III (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-community-acquired-pneumonia-severity-index-psi-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In one of the trials, patients in either arm could be switched to oral levofloxacin after at least three days of intravenous therapy in patients who demonstrated clinical improvement. In an intention-to-treat analysis that combined the results of the two trials, the cure rate with tigecycline was similar to levofloxacin (81 versus 80 percent). However, tigecycline was associated with more nausea and vomiting.

A challenge with studies of empiric therapy of CAP is that there are many potential causes of CAP, with results of studies likely varying depending on the causative pathogens and resistance rates in different regions and settings as well as differences in study design. Varying pneumococcal vaccine recommendations in individual countries might also influence the results of studies of empiric treatment for CAP.</p><p>CAP-START, a large multicenter cluster-randomized crossover trial in the Netherlands, compared empiric therapy using beta-lactam monotherapy, beta-lactam-macrolide combination therapy, or fluoroquinolone monotherapy in patients admitted to inpatient wards for CAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the risk of death by 90 days was 1.9 percent higher with the beta-lactam-macrolide strategy and 0.6 percent lower with the fluoroquinolone monotherapy strategy than with the beta-lactam strategy. These results reflect noninferiority of the beta-lactam strategy. The median length of hospital stay was six days for all strategies. The median time to starting oral treatment was shorter with the fluoroquinolone strategy than with the other strategies (three days with fluoroquinolones versus four days with the other strategies), mainly because more patients receiving a fluoroquinolone started with oral treatment at admission. It is important to note that only 2 percent of patients were found to have infections caused by atypical bacteria; beta-lactams do not have activity against these pathogens. In addition, 27 percent of patients in the beta-lactam monotherapy group received a regimen with activity against atypical bacteria as initial therapy and 39 percent received such a regimen at some point during the hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>The low incidence of atypical bacterial etiologies in the trial described above is likely not representative of other regions since, in other studies from different regions of the world, atypical pathogens accounted for &ge;10 percent of cases of CAP in hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>]. Another limitation of this study and other studies evaluating the need for atypical bacterial coverage is that mortality (especially 90-day mortality rather than shorter-term mortality) may be an insensitive outcome for atypical bacterial pneumonia since these infections have low mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>A multicenter open-label randomized trial of patients with moderately severe CAP in Switzerland compared beta-lactam monotherapy to combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. After seven days of treatment, 41 percent in the monotherapy arm versus 34 percent in the combination arm had not reached clinical stability, a nonsignificant difference. However, the results did not meet the criteria for noninferiority of beta-lactam monotherapy. Patients infected with atypical pathogens (hazard ratio [HR], 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.85) were less likely to reach clinical stability with monotherapy, whereas patients in the two groups not infected with atypical pathogens or with Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) category I to III pneumonia had equivalent outcomes. There was a trend toward patients with PSI category IV pneumonia being less likely to reach clinical stability with monotherapy (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.59-1.10). There were significantly more 30-day readmissions in the monotherapy arm (8 versus 3 percent). Mortality, intensive care unit admission, complications, length of stay, and recurrence of pneumonia within 90 days did not differ between the groups.</p><p>In contrast to the trials described above, in a meta-analysis of observational studies, beta-lactam&ndash;macrolide combination therapy was associated with reduced mortality compared with beta-lactam monotherapy (adjusted odds ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.61-0.73) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Combination therapy was also associated with reduced mortality in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia or pneumococcal pneumonia. Observational studies that have focused on patients with severe CAP have also suggested that combination regimens containing a macrolide plus a beta-lactam result in better clinical outcomes, especially in those with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia; this is likely due to the immunomodulatory effects of macrolides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/67-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-70</a>].</p><p>Similarly, the authors of a 2016 systematic review concluded that, although the two trials discussed above had conflicting results regarding the noninferiority of beta-lactam monotherapy compared with combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/20,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,65</a>], six of eight observational studies found an association between combination therapy and reduced short-term mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>A review of the literature that compared the use of fluoroquinolone monotherapy with the combination of a beta-lactam and a macrolide for community-acquired pneumonia concluded that neither one of the regimens has been proven to be superior to the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Studies comparing fluoroquinolones with beta-lactams plus macrolides are discussed above.

Macrolide resistance occurs via two major mechanisms: methylation of a ribosomal target encoded by the <em>erm</em> gene and efflux of the macrolides by cell membrane protein transporter, encoded by the <em>mef</em> gene (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-clarithromycin-and-telithromycin#H2853599975\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Azithromycin, clarithromycin, and telithromycin&quot;, section on 'Resistance'</a>). <em>S. pneumoniae</em> strains with <em>mef</em> are often resistant at a lower MIC (generally 1 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> than <em>erm</em> strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

In addition, a study from the same group used a theoretical model linking the prevalence of pneumococcal resistance to macrolides with patient outcomes and found that using the proposed 25 percent rate of high-level resistance, which excludes low-level resistance, may result in excess rates of morbidity (3.3 percent for prolonged illness) and mortality (1.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Thus, the rates of pneumococcal resistance at which macrolides should be used for empiric therapy of CAP in outpatients may need to be reassessed.

There were no differences in clinical outcomes for patients with macrolide-susceptible versus macrolide-resistant isolates; however, very few patients were treated with macrolide monotherapy, and the majority were treated with regimens that would be effective against macrolide-resistant strains (eg, a fluoroquinolone or combination therapy that included a beta-lactam).

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Fluoroquinolones versus beta-lactams'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fluoroquinolones are known to cause prolongation of the QT interval. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Moxifloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> have both been associated with ventricular arrhythmias and have comparable cardiac safety profiles in older adult patients requiring hospitalization for treatment of CAP.

Like the fluoroquinolones, the macrolides have also been associated with prolongation of the QT interval. They have also been associated with a small increased risk of cardiovascular death.

(See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Combination therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based upon the available data, patients with CAP should be treated for a minimum of five days if they are afebrile for 48 to 72 hours and have no more than one CAP-associated sign of clinical instability; because of the prolonged half-life of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>, a shorter duration may be indicated for this agent.
