For example, a child might have problems learning to read, write, or do math. Learning disabilities do not have anything to do with how smart a child is. Children with learning disabilities can be just as smart or smarter than other children their age. But they have brain differences that make it hard for them to learn, remember, and use information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1833309788\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of learning disabilities?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is not being able to learn as well as other children. For example, a child with a learning disability might not be able to read, write, or do math as well as other children who are the same age or in the same grade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1833309803\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your child will likely have a number of different tests. The tests check for any problems in the following areas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IQ &ndash; IQ stands for &quot;intelligence quotient.&quot; This test measures how well a person solves problems and understands things.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speech</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor skills &ndash; These tests check how well a child can move large muscles (such as in the legs and arms) and small muscles (such as in the fingers).</p><p/><p>The tests also include a review of the child's school records and watching how he or she acts in a classroom. Different experts, including special education teachers, social workers, or guidance counselors, can do these tests.</p><p>A doctor, nurse, or other expert might also test your child for health or emotional problems, such as worrying or feeling sad or depressed. Problems in those areas can affect how well a child can learn.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1833309820\"><span class=\"h1\">How are learning disabilities treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Learning disabilities are treated with &quot;special education.&quot; This is when a child learns from a teacher with special training. Special education uses different ways to teach children with disabilities. The methods depend on the learning disability. Examples include using pictures along with written or spoken words to explain things. Teachers might also give the child tips on how to remember things or help them stay organized. Children with learning disabilities might be given extra time to solve problems or take tests.</p><p>The earlier your child gets tested and treated for learning disabilities, the better he or she will do in school in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1833309835\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asperger-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asperger syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Autism spectrum disorder (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dyslexia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dyslexia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptoms-and-diagnosis-of-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Symptoms and diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Autism spectrum disorder (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
