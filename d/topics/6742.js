The gastrointestinal and urologic causes of abdominal pain are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute abdominal pain in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation of acute pelvic pain in older women is also discussed separately.

However, gynecologic conditions become more prevalent as etiologies for pelvic pain, especially during late adolescence. The gynecologic causes of acute pelvic pain in adolescent females are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75310 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13206042\"><span class=\"h2\">Life- or organ-threatening conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of pregnancy (eg, ectopic pregnancy, acute abruption, uterine rupture) comprise the most frequent life-threatening gynecologic causes of pelvic pain in adolescent females. Gastrointestinal causes of pelvic pain can be life-threatening if they lead to peritonitis and sepsis. Of these, appendicitis is most common and will be presented briefly here. Other conditions (eg, abscess, bowel obstruction) are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute abdominal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Life-threatening causes'</a>.)</p><p>Life-threatening pelvic trauma in female adolescents is usually the result of a high-energy mechanism, such as a fall from a height or motor vehicle crash. Injury patterns and management are similar to the approach in adults and are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Fracture types'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4155804\"><span class=\"h3\">Ectopic pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients usually present with vaginal bleeding and crampy pelvic pain approximately six to eight weeks after the last menstrual period although later presentation is possible, especially if the pregnancy is not in the fallopian tube. Incidence is increased in those with a prior history of ectopic pregnancy, tubal surgery, and pelvic infection, along with those who use an intrauterine device for contraception.<strong> </strong>Rupture may initially bring temporary relief of pain; however, massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage may ensue with high maternal mortality soon after rupture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Epidemiology, risk factors, and anatomic sites&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4155837\"><span class=\"h3\">Placental abruption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An acute, clinical abruption classically presents with vaginal bleeding, abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> back pain, and uterine contractions. Peak incidence is between the 24<sup>th</sup> and 26<sup>th</sup> week of gestation although placental abruption may occur at any time. The contractions are usually high frequency and low amplitude, but a mild to moderate contraction pattern is also possible. In the presence of a severe abruption (&ge;50 percent placental separation), both fetal and maternal compromise may occur. Acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) develops because blood is exposed to large amounts of tissue factor over a brief period of time. This exposure leads to massive generation of thrombin, resulting in the acute triggering of coagulation. The clinical consequence is a profound systemic bleeding diathesis in the mother and due to widespread intravascular fibrin deposition, tissue ischemic injury, and a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental abruption: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Acute abruption'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4155912\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs and symptoms of uterine rupture can include nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing or fetal death, uterine tenderness, peritoneal irritation, vaginal bleeding, loss of fetal station, and shock. Most uterine ruptures occur in laboring women with a prior cesarean delivery or prior uterine surgery. Rupture of the unscarred uterus during labor is rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women#H2065372767\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute abdominal pain in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;, section on 'Uterine rupture'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13206049\"><span class=\"h3\">Appendicitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute appendicitis is the most common cause for emergent abdominal surgery in children; incidence increases with age and peaks in adolescence. Initial periumbilical pain, which later localizes to the area of peritoneal irritation, usually the right lower quadrant, followed by fever, vomiting, and anorexia is the most common presentation. Obstruction of the appendiceal lumen can lead to thrombosis, necrosis, and if untreated, perforation. Complications involve ileus, abscess formation, intestinal obstruction, peritonitis, sepsis, and shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3093327\"><span class=\"h3\">Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian torsion refers to twisting of the adnexa upon its pedicle and typically presents with an acute onset of sharp, intermittent abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. Formation of ovarian cysts may predispose to torsion, and therefore, torsion has a higher incidence in adolescents than prepubertal girls. This condition requires prompt surgical intervention to prevent necrosis and loss of the ovary. Although typically not life-threatening, ovarian torsion does present a significant risk to the viability of the ovary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion#H327710\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.) </p><p>There have been a number of case reports of fallopian tube torsion in both pre- and post-menarchal females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-the-adolescent-female/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Fallopian tube torsion appears to present in a similar manner as ovarian torsion, but with normal imaging of the ovary itself with discovery of the condition during surgical exploration. As with ovarian torsion, prompt consideration of this diagnosis and surgical detorsion may prevent irreversible ischemic damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion&quot;, section on 'Isolated fallopian tube torsion'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13206084\"><span class=\"h2\">Common conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecologic cause of pelvic pain during adolescence. Pelvic inflammatory disease and mittelschmerz are also frequent. Urinary tract infections (cystitis, pyelonephritis) are very common causes of lower abdominal pain. Nephrolithiasis is an increasingly common cause of pelvic pain in adolescents. Other common urologic etiologies (eg, urinary tract infection) as well as gastrointestinal conditions (eg, constipation, gastrointestinal infection, functional abdominal pain) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute abdominal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Common causes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4156466\"><span class=\"h3\">Dysmenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Menstrual<strong> </strong>pain affects at least two-thirds of postmenarchal females in the United States, some of whom experience severe pain sufficient to affect daily activities. Dysmenorrhea is<strong> </strong>usually crampy and intermittent. Nausea, vomiting,<strong> </strong>diarrhea, headache, dizziness, or back pain may accompany the crampy abdominal pain. The pain and associated symptoms typically begin several hours prior to the onset<strong> </strong>of menstruation and continue for one to three days. The severity of the disorder can be categorized by a grading system based upon the degree of menstrual pain, presence of systemic symptoms, and impact on daily activities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65347 \">table 2</a>).<strong> </strong>Dysmenorrhea can be divided into primary causes (absence of any pelvic pathology and the more common form which typically begins during adolescence) or secondary causes (underlying pelvic pathology, such as endometriosis).<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents#H33859972\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary dysmenorrhea in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4156418\"><span class=\"h3\">Mittelschmerz</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This ovulatory event causes recurrent midcycle pain in females with regular ovulatory cycles. This pain is caused by normal follicular enlargement just prior to ovulation or to normal follicular bleeding at ovulation. The pain is typically mild and unilateral; it occurs midway between menstrual periods and lasts for a few hours to a couple of days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of ruptured ovarian cyst&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4156366\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic inflammatory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is most commonly caused by <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, both of which have the highest prevalence in the adolescent population. PID is an infection of the upper genital tract in females and includes endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic peritonitis.</p><p>Lower abdominal pain is the cardinal presenting symptom in adolescents with PID, although the character of the pain may be quite subtle. The recent onset of pain that worsens during coitus or with jarring movement may be the only presenting symptom of PID; the onset of pain during or shortly after menses is particularly suggestive. About half of patients with PID have fever. On pelvic examination, the findings of a purulent endocervical discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute cervical motion and adnexal tenderness with bimanual examination are strongly suggestive of the diagnosis. Additional nonspecific symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, dysmenorrhea, vaginal discharge, or gastrointestinal symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4156405\"><span class=\"h3\">Ruptured ovarian cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ovarian cyst that ruptures can cause sudden, severe, unilateral pelvic pain without fever or any gastrointestinal, urinary, or vaginal symptoms. Historically, they occur preceding a menstrual period. The pain often begins during strenuous physical activity, such as exercise or sexual intercourse. Blood from the rupture site may seep into the ovary, which can cause pain from stretching of the ovarian cortex, or it may flow into the abdomen, which has an irritant effect on the peritoneum. Significant hemorrhage leading to shock is rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of ruptured ovarian cyst&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4156549\"><span class=\"h3\">Nephrolithiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kidney stones, an increasingly common cause of pelvic pain in adolescents, typically presents with intense, paroxysmal flank pain, which may radiate<strong> </strong>to the lower abdomen and groin regions. The pain is usually colicky and causes the patient to writhe about because they are unable to find a position of comfort. Nausea, vomiting, and urinary symptoms may accompany the pain. The diagnosis of nephrolithiasis is initially suspected by the presentation and clinical evaluation (including urinalysis). It is confirmed by the detection of a stone on imaging studies or by retrieval of a passed stone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H832927\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary tract infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic cystitis causes suprapubic pain and dysuria. Fever, urinary urgency, frequency, and hesitancy may also be present. Pyelonephritis frequently presents with fever, vomiting, flank, and upper back pain. Symptoms of cystitis may also be present. Rapid urine dipstick tests <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> microscopic urinalysis establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-infants-and-children-older-than-one-month-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections in infants and children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Older children'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13206115\"><span class=\"h2\">Other gynecologic conditions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> &ndash; Intrauterine pregnancy is the most common diagnosis for the presentation of secondary amenorrhea. Other common symptoms include morning sickness, breast tenderness, urinary frequency, weight gain, fatigue, and abdominal pain. Pelvic pain is an uncommon primary presenting symptom for pregnancy, although round ligament pain, pubic symphysis separation, or pelvic girdle pain (sacroiliac joint pain) is relatively common. Care must be taken not to miss other causes of pelvic pain (eg, appendicitis, ovarian torsion) in pregnant females. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of early pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-musculoskeletal-changes-and-pain#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Musculoskeletal changes and pain&quot;, section on 'Pelvic girdle pain'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spontaneous abortion</strong> &ndash; Abortion is the outcome of at least 20 percent of all pregnancies, presenting with crampy pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, and passage of some or all of the products of conception. In the face of a nonsterile abortive procedure or incomplete evacuation of all fetal and placental tissue, sepsis may develop. Clinical findings of a septic abortion include fever, diffuse pelvic pain, and malodorous vaginal discharge. Complications, such as septic shock and rarely, pelvic thrombophlebitis, can occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous abortion: Risk factors, etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Developmental anomalies of the M&uuml;llerian duct</strong> &ndash; Anomalies of the M&uuml;llerian duct may cause pelvic pain that first presents at puberty. Of these anomalies, imperforate hymen<strong> </strong>is the most common outflow tract obstruction, and it is most often diagnosed at puberty when menstrual fluid collects. Imperforate hymen can cause primary amenorrhea, a pelvic mass, hydrometrocolpos (dilatation of the uterus and vagina), and pelvic pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of congenital anomalies of the vagina&quot;, section on 'Anomalies of the hymen'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endometriosis</strong> &ndash; Endometrial tissue found outside of the uterus in ectopic locations can cause crampy pelvic pain associated with menses. It has even been known to cause painful defecation and dyspareunia, depending on its location. Though more commonly found in adult women, detection of endometriosis in adolescents is increasing and should be included in the differential. Early diagnosis may impact disease progression and long-term prognosis, especially concerning fertility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis in adolescents: Diagnosis and treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2622939357\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Patient presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reproductive organ and vulvar tumors </strong>&ndash; Neoplasm is rare in the pediatric population, but includes ovarian, uterine, cervical, vaginal, and even vulvar disease. Ovarian tumors occur in approximately 2 percent of adolescents and young adult women. Germ cell tumors are the most common histologically, and the most common of these is the dermoid cyst, or mature cystic teratoma, a benign neoplastic cyst. These tumors contain ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal tissue (ie, hair, bone, teeth, brain, adipose tissue, skin, etc). They can present with dull abdominal pain or a mass, but they are frequently asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging due to calcification or increased echogenicity. They may be bilateral in 7 percent of adolescents. They may also increase the risk of ovarian torsion, and approximately 1 to 3 percent can rupture. There are numerous other malignancies, and though rare, several peak during adolescence, such as immature teratomas, endodermal sinus tumors, mixed germ cell tumors, and gonadoblastoma. These usually present with pelvic pain, a palpable mass, or abdominal distention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian germ cell tumors: Pathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vaginal foreign bodies</strong> &ndash; Foreign bodies include &quot;lost&quot; intrauterine devices, contraceptive rings, condoms, tampons, or other objects intentionally placed in the vaginal cavity. Pelvic pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> purulent vaginal discharge can ensue, especially if significant vaginal wall irritation or trauma ensues. Complications, such as abscess formation or vaginal or uterine perforation, rarely occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chemical irritants</strong> &ndash; Spermicides, lubricants, douching material, or bath products may cause vaginal irritation and pelvic pain. Douching predisposes to bacterial vaginosis and is not necessary for good vulvovaginal hygiene. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sexual assault</strong> &ndash; Pelvic pain may indicate vaginal contusions, bruising, laceration or perforation in adolescents who have been sexually assaulted. The breasts, external genitalia, anus, and rectum should also be carefully examined for signs of injury. Detectable trauma is more likely in adolescent females who are virginal or report vaginal or anal penetration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of adult and adolescent sexual assault victims&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sexual abuse</strong> &ndash; The possibility of abuse, recent or past, absolutely must be included in any differential of acute or chronic pelvic pain. Previous psychological trauma, such as emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, can manifest itself as chronic functional pelvic pain. Depression and anxiety, as a result of abuse or as separate diseases in themselves, may be associated with chronic pelvic pain as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-the-adolescent-female/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Somaticization</strong> &ndash; Feigned symptoms<strong> </strong>should be considered in the absence of organic disease and an inconsistent historical and clinical picture. Psychosocial issues should be investigated, as well as any concern for abuse.
