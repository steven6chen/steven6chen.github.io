Thyroid tissue has a unique ability to take up iodine from blood. Like iodine, radioiodine is taken up and concentrated in thyroid follicular cells because they have a membrane sodium-iodide transporter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Compared with normal thyroid follicular cells, thyroid cancer cells have reduced expression of the transporter, which may account for the low iodine-131 (131-I) uptake in thyroid cancer tissue.</p><p>131-I causes acute thyroid-cell death by emission of short path-length (1 to 2 mm) beta particles. The uptake of 131-I by thyroid tissue can be visualized by scanning to detect the gamma radiation that is also emitted by the isotope. 131-I must be taken up by thyroid tissue to be effective. As a result, it is of no value in patients whose thyroid cancers do not concentrate iodide, for example patients with medullary cancer, lymphoma, or anaplastic cancer.</p><p>Radioiodine therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer will be reviewed here. Surgery, the primary therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer, and an overview of the management of thyroid cancer are discussed separately.

The efficacy of radioiodine depends upon tumor-specific characteristics, sites of disease, patient preparation, and dose. Because of the careful risk stratification used in some studies, it is possible to identify specific patient and tumor characteristics which suggest that radioiodine may be beneficial. Our approach outlined below is in agreement with the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines on the role of postoperative radioiodine ablation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F107641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107641 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263350009\"><span class=\"h2\">Low risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not routinely administer radioiodine after lobectomy or total thyroidectomy to low-risk patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52272 \">table 1</a>).

As an example, in a retrospective analysis of 1129 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer and received radioiodine based upon risk assessment, the majority of patients with low-risk local disease (age &lt;45 years, papillary cancer &lt;4 cm without extrathyroidal extension, and without distant metastases) had low rates of recurrence and high rates of survival when managed without radioiodine (five-year recurrence-free survival &gt;97 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In a study using the National Cancer Database registry, which included 21,870 patients with intermediate-risk papillary thyroid cancer who had total thyroidectomy with or without radioiodine, patients who received radioiodine had improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.62-0.82) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In the National Thyroid Cancer Treatment Cooperative Study Group, a multicenter thyroid cancer registry that has analyzed the outcomes of nearly 5000 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, multivariate analysis showed that radioiodine ablation was associated with improvement in overall survival in stage II patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67832 \">table 4</a>), but this did not reach statistical significance (relative risk [RR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.36-1.28) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H792785728\"><span class=\"h2\">High risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We routinely treat high-risk patients with radioiodine after total thyroidectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F107641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107641 \">table 2</a>), including patients with distant metastases, macroscopic tumor invasion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> incomplete tumor resection with gross residual disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52272 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In the National Thyroid Cancer Treatment Cooperative Study Group, radioiodine was associated with improved overall survival in stage III patients (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.98), with similar but nonsignificant improvement in stage IV (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.46-1.10) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67832 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In addition, data prospectively collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database showed benefit from radioiodine in patients older than 45 years with primary tumors &gt;2 cm, with disease in the lymph nodes at initial diagnosis, and with distant metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The benefits and dose limits of iodine-131 (131-I) therapy for metastatic disease were evaluated in a retrospective analysis of 444 patients treated between 1953 and 1994 (analysis of whole-body iodine scans and conventional radiographs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Fetal thyroid tissue is functional by 10 to 12 weeks and could be destroyed by the radioiodine, resulting in cretinism. Radioiodine should only be administered if a woman has a negative pregnancy test 72 hours before treatment is given or if the possibility of pregnancy is excluded by a history of surgical sterilization in the patient.</p><p>There is increased sodium iodide symporter activity in estrogenized breast tissue, resulting in breast uptake of radioiodine. Breastfeeding should be stopped at least six to eight weeks prior to radioiodine therapy so as to reduce uptake of radioiodine by breast tissue. There are reports of utilization of dopamine agonist drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a> to decrease serum prolactin and hence shorten the time that is required before iodine-131 (131-I) can be administered safely to lactating women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radioiodine causes cytotoxicity by the emission of short path-length (1 to 2 mm) beta radiation. Radioiodine uptake is dependent upon adequate stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and is reduced by the presence of excess stable iodide. Therefore, whenever radioiodine imaging and treatment are planned, the patient should be instructed to avoid all iodine-containing medications and to limit dietary intake of iodine for at least one week (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75830 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Low-iodine diet'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, the intravenous contrast used for computed tomography (CT) scans contains a large iodine load and may interfere with radioiodine scanning and therapy for several months.

There are two methods for increasing TSH, thyroid hormone withdrawal or administration of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH [thyrotropin alfa]). We prefer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>rhTSH for routine radioiodine remnant ablation (destruction of residual normal thyroid tissue) and follow-up scanning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>rhTSH when radioiodine is given as adjuvant therapy (destruction of microscopic residual disease) in low and intermediate-risk patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid hormone withdrawal when radioiodine is given as therapy for known gross residual disease or as adjuvant therapy in high-risk patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, we use rhTSH for such patients in whom severe hypothyroidism might be relatively contraindicated (eg, older adults, patients with depression, congestive heart failure, or severe sleep apnea), allowing them to remain on thyroid hormone therapy.</p><p/><p>This approach is consistent with the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>There are no long-term randomized trial data on recurrence and disease-specific survival to guide choice of preparation. In randomized trials and a meta-analysis, short-term rates of successful remnant ablation were similar after withdrawal of thyroid hormone or after administration of rhTSH (91 to 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/14-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-21</a>]. Two of the larger randomized trials in the meta-analysis compared thyroid hormone withdrawal versus rhTSH and low and high-dose radioiodine:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter trial, 752 patients with low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary or follicular; TNM [Tumor Node Metastasis] stage T1 [&lt;1 cm] and N1 or NX, T1 &gt;1 to 2 cm with any N, or T2N0; absence of distant metastases [M0]) were randomly assigned in a two-by-two factorial design to low or high-dose iodine-131 (131-I) (30 versus 100 mCi [1.1 versus 3.7 GBq]) and to ablation with thyroid hormone withdrawal versus administration of rhTSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The rates of complete ablation at 6 to 10 months were similar (89.1 and 88.9 percent in patients receiving rhTSH and in those undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal, respectively). The results did not change when the analysis was restricted to the 684 patients who received radioiodine and could be evaluated (91.7 and 92.9 percent, respectively).

The rates of successful ablation were similar (87.2 and 86.8 percent for those who received rhTSH versus thyroid hormone withdrawal).

Similarly, a retrospective study with median follow-up of nine years demonstrated similar effectiveness of rhTSH and thyroid hormone withdrawal in low, intermediate, and high-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In addition, two small prospective studies suggest that rhTSH-stimulated radioiodine therapy is effective in destroying microscopic metastatic disease, typically in cervical nodes or pulmonary micrometastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and is associated with a similar five-year survival as thyroid hormone withdrawal in the setting of macroscopic radioiodine-avid distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Thyroid hormone withdrawal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of 131-I treatment of residual tumor or metastatic disease, thyroid hormone withdrawal remains the standard approach to raising TSH levels for adequate radioiodine uptake. Thyroid hormone should be withdrawn three to four weeks prior to radioiodine therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. After thyroidectomy or cessation of T4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>) therapy, the patient's serum thyroxine (T4) concentration must decline sufficiently to allow the serum TSH concentration to rise to above 25 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>To minimize hypothyroid symptoms for patients withdrawing from thyroid hormone, our approach is to reduce the dose of oral T4 by 50 percent for four weeks and then discontinue the T4 for one week prior to administration of radioiodine. Serum TSH should be measured immediately before any 131-I is given to confirm that the concentration is high. One study found that with this approach, the majority of patients taking half-dose T4 achieved a serum TSH concentration of 25 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> by five weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Lower doses (eg, 10 to 12.5 mcg two or three times per day) should be used in older patients and those with ischemic heart disease. After cessation of T3, the serum TSH concentration should rise to 25 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> within one to two weeks. Thus, the interval during which the patient receives no thyroid hormone is shortened.</p><p>One randomized trial comparing administration of placebo or T3 for three weeks following T4 withdrawal found no symptomatic benefit of T3 during thyroid hormone withdrawal and confirmed that a two to three-week period of withdrawal was adequate time duration to see a sufficient rise in TSH to allow radioiodine ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Recombinant human TSH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients treated with radioiodine for thyroid remnant ablation, hypothyroidism can be avoided altogether by administering rhTSH before administration of 131-I.</p><p>With this method, the patient continues their usual dose of T4; rhTSH (0.9 mg) is administered by intramuscular injection on two consecutive days, followed by administration of radioiodine on the day following the second injection (ie, the third day).

For patients with diffuse pulmonary metastases in whom pulmonary fibrosis could be a complication of radioiodine therapy, dosimetry can be used to limit the whole-body radioiodine retention to 80 mCi at 48 hours, which will minimize pulmonary damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>In patients with renal failure or on hemodialysis, there are two dosing approaches to radioiodine therapy: a substantially lower dose of radioiodine followed by the patient's usual dialysis schedule, or a standard radioiodine dose followed by more frequent dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3312575357\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING AFTER RADIOIODINE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-treatment scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor uptake of the treatment dose of radioiodine should be confirmed by performing a whole-body scan two to eight days after radioiodine treatment. In about 6 to 13 percent of these post-treatment scans, foci of uptake that were not seen on the corresponding low-dose iodine-131 (131-I) pre-therapy scan are seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/51,89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,89,90</a>].

If significant uptake is seen within the thyroid bed (&gt;1 percent), one more treatment with 100 to 150 mCi (3.7 to 5.6 GBq) of 131-I may be given to complete the ablation; generally, we are reluctant to repeat treatment of minor thyroid bed uptake (&lt;1 percent) in the absence of clear evidence of residual cancer by other imaging techniques, such as ultrasound.</p><p>If there is uptake outside of the thyroid bed, we give doses of 131-I appropriate to the site of uptake. Prior to incorporating stimulated Tg testing into diagnostic algorithms, a common approach was to continue scanning to obtain two successive negative 131-I scans, which predicted a 97 percent 10-year relapse-free survival compared with 91 percent after only one negative scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>With the advent of stimulated Tg testing either by hormone withdrawal or recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH [thyrotropin alfa]), a single negative <span class=\"nowrap\">scan/Tg</span> combination may be sufficient in stage III or IV patients, and lower-risk patients with negative Tg levels may not require follow-up scanning at all.

Since radioiodine is washed out rapidly after the administration of lemon juice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>], additional studies are needed to determine optimal timing of administration to reduce delivery of radioiodine to the salivary glands and provide optimal washout.</p><p>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually adequate for relieving symptoms of acute sialadenitis; glucocorticoids are rarely required but are effective in more severe cases.

The treated patient should remain &ge;1.8 m (six feet) away from family members, caregivers, and the general public as much as possible for approximately 24 hours after treatment. Adult caregivers may be closer than 1 m (three feet) for brief intervals. In general, the treated patient should be instructed to avoid public transportation and extended time in public places and should not stay overnight in a hotel or motel within 24 hours of 131-I treatment.</p><p>To protect household members from radiation exposure, the treated patient should avoid the following during the restricted period:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleeping in the same bed with another adult, pregnant woman, infant, or child</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual contact</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kissing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sharing cups, utensils, towels, razors, toothbrushes</p><p/><p>The duration of the restricted period depends upon the dose received, amount of thyroid tissue, and rate of clearance.

Dishes and utensils can be washed by hand or in a dishwasher. Flushable waste can be flushed down the toilet. Non-flushable waste (ie, incontinence pads) should be disposed of in a plastic trash bag devoted to radiation waste. Caregivers should wear disposable plastic gloves during clean-up.
