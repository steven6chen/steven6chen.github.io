Although a great deal is known about the abnormalities in immune, endothelial, and fibroblast cell function in SSc, it is unclear how these pathogenic pathways are initiated.</p><p>The etiology of SSc is unknown. The remarkable complexity of its pathogenesis suggests that no single gene or environmental trigger is, by itself, likely to be responsible for the development of SSc. Genetic factors clearly influence disease susceptibility as well as patterns of disease expression. The occurrence of SSc-like disease in response to certain environmental agents and the possible relationship of SSc to environmental exposures suggest that certain triggers lead to variable disease expression in genetically susceptible hosts.</p><p>A review of the risk factors for and possible causes of SSc is presented here. The pathogenesis of SSc, including vascular and endothelial changes, fibroblast activity, and the role of different cytokines, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to viruses or to certain environmental toxins and drugs appears to trigger the development of disease in genetically susceptible hosts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence for genetic factors contributing to disease susceptibility in systemic sclerosis (SSc) comes from a variety of studies. Studies of the Choctaw Native Americans in Oklahoma showed that the prevalence of SSc was 20 times higher than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Furthermore, disease expression was remarkably homogeneous, with diffuse skin disease, lung involvement, and anti-topoisomerase I (Scl-70) antibodies detected in almost all affected individuals. The risk of SSc in first-degree relatives of individuals with SSc is markedly increased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidate genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the Choctaw Native-American population, the presence of anti-topoisomerase I antibodies is strongly linked to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and, more specifically, to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype DQ7, DR2 (DRB1*1602) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Other risk-associated alleles are DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0301 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Subsequent studies showed a link between the fibrillin-1 gene, implicated in a putative mouse model of inherited scleroderma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and SSc in this Native-American population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but not in Caucasian French or Italian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Neither the MHC nor the fibrillin-1 gene shows a perfect association with the disease; there are affected individuals without the suspect genes and unaffected individuals with these genes.</p><p>Genes in the MHC influence disease susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. As an example, the HLA-DQA1*0501 allele was found in 42 percent of Caucasian men with diffuse cutaneous SSc but in only 29 percent of healthy men from the same geographic area (odds ratio 3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Risk associations have also been suggested to exist between SSc and <span class=\"nowrap\">HLA-DR5/11</span> and DR3 haplotypes in Caucasians, DR2 haplotypes in Japanese, and, as noted above, DR2 (DRB1*1602) in the Choctaw population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>There is also an association between HLA and certain SSc-specific autoantibodies. These include antibodies directed against fibrillarin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], anticentromere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], anti-PM-Scl [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and topoisomerase I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/2,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14,15</a>].</p><p>Genetic polymorphisms in the genes for angiotensin converting enzyme (<em>ACE</em>), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (<em>eNOS</em>), the B cell surface protein associated with the antigen receptor (<em>CD19</em>), and <em>PTPN22</em> have been suggested to confer risk for SSc in general or for some specific subsets (eg, anticentromere-positive and anti-topoisomerase-positive SSc and the <em>PTPN22</em> R620W allele) in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. However, the putative association between <em>ACE</em> and <em>eNOS</em> polymorphisms and SSc could not be independently confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88469500\"><span class=\"h2\">Genome-wide association studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genome-wide screening in a case-control study in the Choctaw population confirmed earlier candidate gene regions (eg, MHC and the fibrillin gene) and identified other sites dispersed on several chromosomes that were associated with disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These sites are near the genes for secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (<em>SPARC</em>) and topoisomerase I, a target for SSc autoantibodies.</p><p>The largest genome-wide screening study examined 2753 patients with SSc (mostly of European ancestry) and 5171 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Several susceptibility loci were identified, including the HLA locus and gene regions for <em>CD247</em>, interferon regulatory factor 5 (<em>IRF5</em>), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (<em>STAT4</em>). Each of these SSc-susceptibility loci is involved in immune recognition, in innate immunity, or in immune cell signaling. Interestingly, a majority of gene variants associated with SSc have also been linked to other autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4251370\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial clustering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further support for a genetic basis of SSc is provided by familial clustering of SSc or autoimmune disorders. One study of 710 families with one member having SSc reported a 1.4 percent incidence in another family member [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Similar frequencies have been observed in other studies (1.5 to 2.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The increased risk is similar for siblings and other first-degree relatives of affected patients (15- and 13-fold higher, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Familial studies of autoantibodies in SSc are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic factors determine whether disease develops and which phenotype is expressed. Although monozygotic twins are only modestly concordant for SSc (4.7 percent), they are 90 percent concordant for antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity (titer of &ge;1:40) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/2,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26</a>]. Similarly, family members of patients with SSc are much more likely to have ANA than are healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-HLA gene associations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1645998773\"><span class=\"h3\">PTPN22 gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A polymorphism of the <em>PTPN22</em> gene was associated with the finding of anticentromere and anti-topoisomerase antibodies in SSc patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/19,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29</a>]. This gene has also been reported to be important in a number of other autoimmune conditions, including diabetes mellitus-type I, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, Grave disease, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2021575972\"><span class=\"h3\">IRF8 gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A polymorphism in the <em>IRF8</em> gene was found by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to be protective for SSc disease susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2499067463\"><span class=\"h3\">TNFAIP3 (A20) gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A polymorphism of the <em>TNFAIP3</em> gene was found to be associated with diffuse cutaneous SSc and was further associated with interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Carriage of the risk allele was also associated with an increased risk of fibrosing alveolitis in this population of Western European Caucasian ancestry. International GWAS have identified <em>IRF5</em> as a susceptibility locus for SSc in a European population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other recurrent genes associated with SSc or specific SSc subsets include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>STAT4</em>, the signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>], is a transcription factor implicated in inflammatory signaling. Several studies have indicated an association of polymorphisms in <em>STAT4</em> with SSc.

Thus, one hypothesis is that infection, particularly with a virus, may trigger a cascade of events in a genetically susceptible host leading to systemic sclerosis (SSc).</p><p>One possibility is that infection with a virus harboring amino acid sequences similar to those found within host proteins may initiate the disease process. This general phenomenon, not unique to SSc, is called molecular mimicry. One study described a common epitope shared between topoisomerase I, a key target autoantigen in SSc, and certain retroviruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Latent viral infection may also accelerate or promote disease in the susceptible host.

One of the earliest associations, with silica dust, was discovered because of the high frequency of SSc among stone masons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Similar clustering has been observed among gold miners in South Africa and among coal miners in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>However, a careful case-control study from the United Kingdom did not support an association of SSc with occupational silica exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Since the use of vibrating machinery is associated with the Raynaud phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] and since silica may cause interstitial lung disease (silicosis), some cases described as SSc may instead have had the confluence of these two disorders.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 16 observational studies, which examined the risk of occupational silica exposure, found that such exposure was associated with significant risk for the development of SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Although the risk in males was significant (combined estimator of relative risk [CERR] 3, 95% CI 1.2-7.4), the risk in females was not (CERR 1, 95% CI 0.7-1.4). The risk estimate in cohort studies was higher than the estimate in case-control studies (CERR 15.4 versus 2.2).</p><p>There was concern about a possible relationship between silicone exposure, primarily in breast implant recipients, and SSc or SSc-like disease. However, multiple large epidemiologic studies and a meta-analysis failed to provide evidence supporting a causative relationship. In one study, the prevalence rates for SSc and other autoimmune disorders were compared among 1576 women with breast implants (of whom 1112 had received silicone gel-filled implants) and 726 control individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

This illness, characterized by fasciitis and dermal induration, occurred in individuals consuming the nutritional supplement L-tryptophan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. Affected individuals showed chronic diffuse skin induration, as well as neuropathy and myopathic features, but, in marked distinction to SSc, they did not have the Raynaud phenomenon, SSc-specific autoantibodies, or visceral disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>The syndrome showed certain clinical similarities to the toxic oil syndrome described above. Its development was linked to the consumption of specific batches of L-tryptophan originating from a single manufacturer in Japan. Analysis of the implicated batches of L-tryptophan revealed the presence of trace amounts of 1,1'-ethylidenebis(tryptophan), a contaminant apparently introduced during the process of bacterial fermentation.</p><p>A well-documented post-epidemic case of EMS has been reported in an individual who used L-tryptophan subsequent to the 2005 lifting of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ban on L-tryptophan in the United States that had followed the identification of the syndrome and its link to the specific contaminant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This case highlights the continued occurrence of L-tryptophan-associated EMS. Sporadic cases meeting surveillance criteria for EMS but lacking L-tryptophan exposure have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>In addition to a significant positive association with L-tryptophan dose and increased age, both increased risk of EMS and protection following exposure have been associated with several class II histocompatibility gene polymorphisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Another dietary supplement, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-OHTrp) has been associated with an EMS-like disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

Exposure to environmental triggers, including viruses or certain unidentified toxins, may lead to variable disease expression in genetically susceptible hosts. In some individuals, genetic factors may be sufficiently strong to lead to disease expression. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An important role for genetic influences in SSc is suggested by associations of a number of different genes with the development in SSc in different populations and by evidence of familial clustering of disease. The genetic findings include associations with certain major histocompatibility antigen (MHC) class II alleles and other genes involved in immune recognition or signaling. There is also an association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and certain SSc-specific autoantibodies. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Candidate genes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other genes linked to SSc susceptibility include non-HLA genes such as the <em>TNFAIP3</em>, <em>CD247</em>, and <em>PTPN22</em> genes and genes for interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Non-HLA gene associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotheses that include a role for infection in SSc pathogenesis have suggested mechanisms related to molecular mimicry or more direct cellular effects of latent viral infection, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), which may induce the vascular, fibrotic, and immunologic features of SSc via effects on various cell types. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Infectious agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of environmental agents have been implicated in SSc, based upon case clustering or formal epidemiological studies. Occupational silica exposure in men is associated with a significant increase in risk. There is no evidence of a relationship between silicone exposure from breast implants and the development of SSc or SSc-like disease. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Noninfectious environmental factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A relationship between certain toxic exposures and SSc or SSc-like syndromes has been observed for several substances. Exposure to organic solvents has been associated with both SSc and undifferentiated connective tissue disease. SSc-like disorders may occur in patients exposed to vinyl chloride or to contaminated rapeseed oil. The SSc-like eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (EMS) was reported in individuals exposed to contaminated L-tryptophan. A chemotherapeutic agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, and several other medications have also been associated with the development of SSc or SSc-like disorders. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Petroleum-based products'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Vinyl chloride'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Contaminated rapeseed oil'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'L-tryptophan'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some studies have suggested a potential role for increased microchimerism in SSc.
