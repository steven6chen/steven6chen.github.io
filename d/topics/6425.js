The spots often have a dark center surrounded by pale red rings, like a target or bull's-eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66481\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66481 \">picture 1</a>). Sometimes, the spots have blisters.</p><p>The spots can appear in different places on the body, including the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arms and legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest and back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Face and neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palms of the hands</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soles of the feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lips, tongue, and gums</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Near the eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genital area</p><p/><p>The spots might itch or burn. Some people have a fever and feel tired and achy before the spots appear. The spots usually show up over 3 to 5 days. They disappear in about 2 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6064960\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes erythema multiforme?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the time, erythema multiforme is caused by an infection. But medicines can cause erythema multiforme, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6064975\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your nurse or doctor should be able to tell if you have erythema multiforme by looking at your skin and doing an exam. He or she might also take a small skin sample and a blood sample. These samples will help your doctor make sure your symptoms aren't being caused by another medical condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6064992\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can try putting a cool, damp cloth on the area with the spots. You can also take over-the-counter medicines such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Diphenhydramine</a> (sample brand name: Benadryl) for itching and swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) for fever and discomfort</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6065007\"><span class=\"h1\">How is erythema multiforme treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include medicines to ease itching and pain. Some medicines are creams that you rub on your skin. Others are pills.</p><p>If you have spots in your mouth, your doctor might give you a special mouthwash to help relieve the pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6065022\"><span class=\"h1\">Can erythema multiforme be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your condition was caused by a medicine, do not take that medicine again. Talk to your doctor or nurse about switching to a different medicine.</p><p>Some people who are infected with a certain virus keep getting erythema multiforme over and over again. If you get erythema multiforme more than several times a year, talk with your doctor or nurse. He or she might give you a medicine to take every day that will help keep you from getting it so often.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
