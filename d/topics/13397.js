Many complications are mechanical (eg, papillary muscle rupture or left ventricular wall rupture, ventricular septal defect) and are related to the extent of myocardial injury, while other post-MI complications are immunologic, inflammatory, or iatrogenic.</p><p>Three major types of pericardial complications can occur in patients following a myocardial infarction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early infarct-associated pericarditis (often termed peri-infarction pericarditis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial effusion (with or without tamponade), including hemopericardium (due to myocardial rupture)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postcardiac injury (Dressler's) syndrome</p><p/><p>Each of these complications is related to infarct size and, as will be described below, has declined in incidence in the revascularization era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of pericardial complications of MI will be presented here. Details of the non-pericardial complications of MI are discussed separately.

The parietal layer forms a closed sac with the visceral layer. The pericardium is reflected from the pulmonary veins and caval vessels as they enter the heart. The parietal pericardium has attachments to the sternum and to the diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Normally, a small amount of serous fluid (less than 25 to 50 mL) is contained within the pericardial sac.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233207440\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiology of cardiac tamponade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cardiac tamponade, the primary abnormality is compression of all cardiac chambers due to increased pericardial pressure. The pericardium has some degree of elasticity; but once its elastic limit is reached, the heart must compete with the intrapericardial fluid for the relatively fixed total intrapericardial volume. Very little additional fluid needs to accumulate to produce cardiac tamponade once the pericardium can no longer stretch. As cardiac tamponade progresses, the cardiac chambers become smaller, further compromising the cardiac output.</p><p>A full discussion of the physiology of cardiac tamponade is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;, section on 'Physiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PERI-INFARCTION PERICARDITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute pericarditis may complicate the course of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Peri-infarction pericarditis (PIP) usually occurs soon following the MI and is transient and self-limited. One study of MI without reperfusion found that 68 percent of audible pericardial rubs were heard on day 1 or 2, 85 percent were audible for less than three days, and persistence of the rub was rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2058507375\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology of PIP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of PIP appears to have decreased following the widespread use of fibrinolytic or mechanical reperfusion therapy. Pericarditis has been reported in approximately 5 percent of patients treated with fibrinolytic agents versus 12 to 20 percent in those not receiving fibrinolytic (or mechanical) reperfusion therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1,2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5</a>]. There are no large-scale studies reporting the incidence of PIP in the era of primary percutaneous coronary intervention.</p><p>The efficacy of reperfusion (or lack of reperfusion) is consistent with other observations suggesting that the appearance of a friction rub in the first two or three days after an acute MI is strongly associated with larger infarct size, as manifested by higher creatine kinase and troponin levels, lower ejection fraction, more frequent anterior location of the MI, and increased in-hospital and one-year mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1,2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation and diagnosis of PIP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a pericardial friction rub is diagnostic of peri-infarction pericarditis. Pleuritic chest pain and especially pain in one or both trapezius ridges is also consistent with the diagnosis. In contrast to acute pericarditis occurring in other settings, electrocardiogram (ECG) findings in patients with suspect PIP may be less obvious and dependent on the changes seen on the ECG following the MI.</p><p>PIP can present in a variety of ways, most of which are similar to the presentation of acute pericarditis of other etiologies. The major clinical manifestations of PIP include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain &ndash; Typically sharp, pleuritic, and centrally located; the pain is improved by sitting up and leaning forward.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial friction rub &ndash; A superficial scratchy or squeaking sound best heard with the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the left sternal border; the rub is frequently intermittent and may be difficult to appreciate, but is diagnostic when present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECG changes &ndash; New widespread ST elevation or PR depression which extend beyond a typically anatomic regional boundary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial effusion.</p><p/><p>The typical ECG changes seen with other presentations of pericarditis are often overshadowed by the changes due to the MI. However, ST segments that remain elevated, with persistence of upright T waves, may suggest PIP or early onset post-cardiac injury syndrome (PCIS), as may T waves that become upright again after having been inverted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of PIP is often suspected based on a history of characteristic pleuritic chest pain within days post-MI, and confirmed if a pericardial friction rub is present. It is not unusual for PIP to be asymptomatic, with only a pericardial rub signaling its presence. Additional testing, which typically includes blood work, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography, can support the diagnosis but is frequently normal or unrevealing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>While the absence of pericardial effusion by echocardiography does not exclude PIP, echocardiography should be performed in patients suspected of having PIP specifically to evaluate for the presence of a pericardial effusion which may be related to other potential post-MI complications. Patients with a post-MI pericardial effusion greater than 10 mm in thickness are at significantly increased risk of free wall rupture or may have already had a rupture that is subacute and contained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Blood that has coagulated within the pericardial space has a distinct appearance of &quot;jelly&quot; floating. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Post-MI pericardial effusion'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Rupture of the left ventricular free wall'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of PIP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to patients with PIP, which is usually self-limited, is to avoid using anti-inflammatory drugs for 7 to 10 days after an acute MI (other than once daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> as prescribed for secondary prevention following the MI). For patients with significant symptoms who require analgesia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> may be employed as initial treatment. If this does not suffice and, for patients who remain symptomatic after the initial 7 to 10 days, we recommend aspirin 650 mg every six to eight hours rather than other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or glucocorticoids. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine coadministration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> (along with aspirin) in this population.</p><p>In contrast with viral or acute idiopathic pericarditis, treatment with routine anti-inflammatory therapy is generally avoided in patients with PIP. The treatment of PIP is supportive, with administration of analgesic medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> as needed, as almost all cases are self-limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, a minority of patients have symptoms that require more than supportive care. For patients with persistent symptoms of PIP despite conservative measures, we recommend using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 650 to 1000 mg three times daily.</p><p>There is no evidence that any anti-inflammatory drug favorably alters the outcome of PIP. Accordingly, the 2013 guidelines of the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) gave nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) and glucocorticoids a class III recommendation (harmful) in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. We agree with this approach and avoid these drugs for the treatment of PIP.</p><p>In contrast to post-cardiac injury syndromes, there is no published experience on the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> in PIP, in part reflecting the fact that so few cases persist long enough to warrant consideration of treatment other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. In such unusual cases, based on indirect evidence of the efficacy of colchicine in the treatment of pericarditis from other etiologies, a trial of colchicine may be warranted.

There is a theoretical concern that antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy might promote the development of a hemorrhagic pericardial effusion in patients with PIP. However, such a relationship has never been established, and the risk-benefit ratio overwhelmingly favors the continuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other anticoagulants, as needed.</p><p>It is common practice <strong>not</strong> to alter antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy in most patients with PIP. One analysis of patients with acute MI treated with fibrinolysis reported that 40 of 810 patients developed pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, cardiac tamponade did not occur clinically in any patient who developed a friction rub. In addition, the benefits of antiplatelet therapy post-MI, particularly following percutaneous revascularization with stent placement, are well proven and discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-for-the-secondary-prevention-of-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-for-elective-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-general-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy for elective percutaneous coronary intervention: General use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is little evidence to guide the use of antiplatelet therapy in patients with a large pericardial effusion. However, for most patients with PIP and a large pericardial effusion, we do not routinely modify antiplatelet therapy. We do monitor the size of the pericardial effusion and the patient's hemodynamic status to assess for signs of cardiac tamponade. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-MI PERICARDIAL EFFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericardial effusion is common in the early course of transmural myocardial infarction (MI). However, clinically significant post-MI pericardial effusions leading to signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade remain rare, particularly in the era of primary reperfusion therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3708270138\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial echocardiographic studies have shown that pericardial effusion occurs in approximately one-third of cases of acute ST elevation MI (STEMI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]. In a review of 330 patients with an acute STEMI before the era of widespread reperfusion therapy, 83 (25 percent) had a pericardial effusion on the third day, more than one-half of whom did not have a pericardial friction rub [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The major risk factor for development of a pericardial effusion was poor hemodynamic function (presumably reflecting larger infarct size).</p><p>The pericardial effusion is most often minimal or mild. As with peri-infarction pericarditis (PIP), however, an effusion post-MI is associated with higher morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. In a retrospective study of 228 consecutive patients (48 percent treated with thrombolysis or primary percutaneous revascularization) who developed post-MI pericardial effusions that were moderate-to-large in size (10 mm or greater thickness), 30-day mortality was higher (43 percent) compared with those with smaller effusions or no effusion (10 and 6 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a post-MI pericardial effusion are usually asymptomatic, and the accrual of pericardial fluid is typically self-limited. However, if pericardial fluid continues to accumulate and intrapericardial pressure exceeds left ventricular filling pressures, patients develop dyspnea, chest discomfort or fullness, peripheral edema, fatigability, or other symptoms referable to increased filling pressures and limited cardiac output. A number of findings may be present on physical examination, most commonly sinus tachycardia, although none of the findings alone are highly sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. All patients with suspected cardiac tamponade should undergo echocardiography to assess for the presence and hemodynamic impact of a pericardial effusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade#H242973994\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p>Most patients with a post-MI pericardial effusion are asymptomatic, with the presence of a pericardial effusion identified incidentally on an echocardiogram performed for other reasons (eg, evaluation of left ventricular function post-MI, etc). The rate of resorption is surprisingly slow, with one echocardiographic study reporting a prevalence of persistent pericardial effusion at one day, three days, 10 days, three months, and six months of 17, 25, 21, 11, and 8 percent respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A small number of effusions persisted beyond one year.</p><p>Rarely, large pericardial effusions can develop along with symptoms suggestive of cardiac tamponade (eg, dyspnea, chest discomfort or fullness, peripheral edema, fatigability). Data from a combined clinical trials database of over 100,000 patients with a STEMI who were treated with fibrinolytic therapy found an incidence of isolated (no ventricular septal rupture, no acute mitral regurgitation) cardiac tamponade of 0.85 percent during the initial hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peri-infarct pericarditis (PIP) usually occurs soon following the MI and is usually transient and self-limited. The presence of a pericardial friction rub is diagnostic of PIP, while pleuritic chest pain is also consistent with the diagnosis. In contrast to acute pericarditis that occurs in other settings, ECG findings in patients with suspect PIP may be less obvious and depend on the changes seen due to the MI itself. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and diagnosis of PIP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to patients with PIP, which is usually self-limited, is to avoid using anti-inflammatory drugs for 7 to 10 days after an acute MI (other than once daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> as prescribed for secondary prevention following the MI). For patients with symptoms who require early anti-inflammatory therapy, or patients who remain symptomatic after the initial 7 to 10 days, we recommend aspirin at higher doses rather than other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine coadministration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> (along with aspirin) in this population, although based on indirect evidence in the treatment of pericarditis from other etiologies, a trial of colchicine may be warranted in occasional patients with difficult to manage or unusually protracted symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Management of PIP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial effusion is common in the early course of transmural MI. Patients with a post-MI pericardial effusion are typically asymptomatic, and the accrual of pericardial fluid is typically self-limited. However, if pericardial fluid continues to accumulate and intrapericardial pressure exceeds left ventricular filling pressures, signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade may develop. All patients with suspected cardiac tamponade should undergo echocardiography to assess for the presence and hemodynamic impact of a pericardial effusion. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal management of post-MI pericardial effusion varies depending upon the etiology of the effusion as well as the presence or absence of symptoms felt to be related to the effusion. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Management of post-MI pericardial effusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a post-MI pericardial effusion that is suspected to be related to a mechanical complication (ie, free wall rupture), urgent surgical repair is typically required for any chance of survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a pericardial effusion and no suspected mechanical complication who are symptomatic due to cardiac tamponade, definitive treatment requires drainage of the pericardial fluid, which is almost always accomplished percutaneously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a pericardial effusion and no suspected mechanical complication who have an incidentally found pericardial effusion and no evidence of cardiac tamponade, no specific therapy is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The postcardiac injury syndrome (PCIS), also called Dressler's syndrome, postpericardiotomy syndrome, and, when occurring after MI, postmyocardial infarction syndrome, typically has a longer latency period and is thought to be immune-mediated. Patients who develop PCIS present with signs and symptoms similar to those seen in patients with acute pericarditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pericardial effusion in other clinical settings.
