It is important to understand that leakage is not a normal part of aging and that treatments are available to reduce or eliminate the problem. Your health care clinician can help you with treatment if you are bothered by leaking urine, having to rush to the toilet frequently, or getting up from sleeping to go to the toilet.</p><p>This article discusses treatments for the two main types of leakage in women, stress incontinence and urgency incontinence. These treatments also apply to women who have a combination of urgency and stress incontinence, called mixed incontinence. Information about the different types of urinary incontinence and the causes, symptoms, and diagnosis of urinary incontinence is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary incontinence in women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More detailed information about incontinence in women as well as information about lower urinary tract symptoms in men is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urinary incontinence in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower urinary tract symptoms in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1220534567\"><span class=\"h1\">BEFORE STARTING TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain health conditions can worsen urine leakage. You should talk to your health care provider about treating these conditions and any medications that might be worsening your urinary leakage. Your primary care clinician can help you initiate treatment, but you should seek treatment from a continence specialist if you experience blood in the urine, multiple infections (three or more in one year), fevers, pain, or vaginal prolapse (a bulge) beyond the opening of the vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following treatments may be helpful for women with stress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urgency incontinence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605399943\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some changes in your lifestyle may help symptoms of urinary leakage.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weight loss </strong>&ndash; If you are overweight or obese, talk to your health care provider about strategies to lose weight. In people who are obese or overweight, losing weight often helps to reduce urine leakage in addition to improving other chronic medical conditions that are associated with incontinence (eg, diabetes and hypertension).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluid management </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>If you drink large amounts of fluids, you may find that cutting back on fluids will reduce your leakage. A total of 64 ounces of all liquids (water, juice, milk, etc) per day is sufficient for most people; you may need more fluid when you are active and sweating or if it is hot. If you drink too little fluid, your urine may become very concentrated and darker than usual; this can irritate your bladder and increase the urgency to urinate. One recommendation is to drink small amounts of fluid at regular intervals throughout the day (rather than drinking larger amounts all at once).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We also suggest reducing the amount of alcoholic, caffeinated, and carbonated beverages you drink. This may help decrease urinary urgency and leakage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If you get up frequently during the night to urinate, stop drinking fluids three to four hours before you go to bed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoiding constipation </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Constipation can make urinary leakage worse. Increasing the amount of fiber in your diet to 30 grams per day may prevent constipation. Treatment of constipation is discussed in a separate topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Constipation in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scheduled voiding</strong> &ndash; Emptying your bladder (&quot;voiding&quot;) at regular intervals, rather than waiting until your bladder is very full, can decrease episodes of urgency incontinence and prevent stress leakage during physical activity with a full bladder. Try urinating every three to four hours regularly throughout the day.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605400014\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic muscle exercises</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic muscle exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, strengthen the muscles involved in controlling urine leakage. This is explained in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F81507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81507 \">table 1</a>). (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-floor-muscle-exercises-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>).</p><p>Practicing these exercises on a regular basis helps to strengthen the muscles used to support the urethra and prevent leakage caused by stress incontinence (eg, coughing, laughing, sneezing). If you have sudden urges to urinate, you can also perform these exercises to help temporarily control the urge. To do this, you need to stop what you are doing and do three quick pelvic floor contractions until the urgency subsides. Using this &ldquo;freeze and squeeze&rdquo; technique can reduce bladder contractions and give you more time to get to the toilet. If you have difficulty doing these exercises, talk to your health care provider to see what options are available to help you do the exercises better.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605400065\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder training can help you learn to go to the bathroom less frequently by &quot;retraining&quot; your bladder to hold more urine.Bladder training has two components: going to the bathroom on a schedule while you are awake and using strategies to control sudden urges. A table describes a method for bladder training (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66056\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66056 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You begin by going to the bathroom at specific intervals during the day, starting with a short time interval between trips to the bathroom.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have an urgent need to urinate before it is time to go the bathroom again, try to suppress the urge by standing or sitting still, performing the pelvic muscle exercise described above (&ldquo;freeze and squeeze&quot;), and thinking of the urge as a wave that is fading away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When your urine control improves, increase the time between bathroom trips by 15 minutes. Your goal is to slowly increase this time up to a more normal interval. It is normal to urinate approximately every three to four hours during the day and for older adults to wake from sleeping to urinate up to once per night.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1049564891\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical vaginal estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal estrogen may be helpful for women who are near menopause or have recently gone through menopause and have urinary incontinence and vaginal atrophy (dryness). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-dryness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaginal dryness (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605400115\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENTS FOR STRESS INCONTINENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you continue to have symptoms despite the initial treatments for stress urinary incontinence, you can discuss other options with your health care provider.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supervised pelvic floor physical therapy &ndash; If you are not performing Kegel exercises effectively, you may benefit from formal instruction on how to do them. There are nurses and physical therapists specifically trained to assist with these exercises for your pelvic floor muscles, like having a &ldquo;personal trainer.&rdquo;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vaginal pessaries </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>A vaginal pessary is a flexible device made of silicone that can be worn in the vagina. A pessary can help to reduce or eliminate stress incontinence. A pessary is a reasonable treatment if you want to delay or avoid surgery. When fit properly, you will not feel any discomfort with the pessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The pessary must be removed and cleaned with soap and water periodically. Many women can learn to do this on their own and are advised to remove it overnight once every week or two. For those women who cannot remove the device, the pessary can be monitored, cleaned, and replaced by a health care provider every three to six months. There is a small risk that the pessary can cause irritation or an erosion of the skin inside the vagina. If this occurs, vaginal estrogen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> more frequent removal can resolve the problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medications </strong>&ndash; In the United States, there are no medications that have been approved for stress incontinence. Multiple medications have been evaluated for stress incontinence. You should talk to your health care provider about whether or not there are any medication options that are appropriate for you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Surgery offers the highest cure rate of any treatment for stress urinary incontinence, even in older women. There are several surgical procedures for the treatment of stress incontinence. Each procedure has its own risks, benefits, complications, and chance of failure. These issues should be discussed in detail with a surgeon who is experienced in performing procedures to treat incontinence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, surgery for stress urinary incontinence is not recommended until you are finished having children because pregnancy and childbirth can cause damage, potentially allowing leakage to recur.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENTS FOR URGENCY INCONTINENCE AND OVERACTIVE BLADDER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you continue to have symptoms despite initial treatments for urgency incontinence, you can discuss other options, such as medication, with your health care provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some people, urgency incontinence is more severe and a medicine is needed to get symptoms under control. Examples of these medications include darifenacin (brand name: Enablex), fesoterodine (brand name: Toviaz), mirabegron (brand name: Myrbetriq), oxybutynin (sample brand names: Ditropan, Oxytrol, Gelnique), solifenacin (brand name: VESIcare), tolterodine (sample brand name: Detrol), and trospium (Sanctura and others).</p><p>Some people take medicine temporarily, until symptoms improve, while others take medication indefinitely.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common side effects of these medications are dry mouth, constipation, and heartburn. The Oxytrol patch is associated with the least amount of these side effects and is available over the counter without a prescription. In the United States, tolterodine is also available without a prescription, whereas the other medications require a prescription. Mirabegron works differently than the other medications and does not cause dry mouth and constipation side effects but may raise blood pressure, so you should have your blood pressure monitored carefully while taking this medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several strategies to prevent and treat dry mouth and constipation. These include sucking on sugar-free candy or chewing gum and using over-the-counter oral lubricants. Constipation can be managed typically with fiber supplementation and dietary options such as prunes and prune juice. It is important not to drink more water to combat these symptoms, as excessive fluid intake can result in more urine leakage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a small risk of urinary retention (not being able to empty the bladder completely) with these medications, especially in older people. If you develop difficulty urinating or feel like you are not completely emptying your bladder, you should follow up with your provider for evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605400152\"><span class=\"h2\">Other therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If medications are not enough to improve your symptoms, there are other options for treatment that you can discuss with your health care provider.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acupuncture</strong> &ndash; Acupuncture might improve urinary incontinence in some women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Botox </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Botulinum toxin A, also known as Botox, is a toxin produced by a bacteria that temporarily paralyzes muscles. Studies have examined using injections of Botox into the bladder as a treatment for urgency incontinence, for people who have not responded to other treatments. Botulinum toxin A is as effective as oral medication in decreasing leakage and more effective in eliminating leakage altogether [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-treatments-for-women-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, there is a risk that botulinum toxin A will prevent the bladder from emptying. If this happened, you would need to insert a catheter (a thin tube) into your bladder several times per day to empty. However, the side effects are usually temporary. The decrease in leakage with botulinum toxin A injection can last six months or longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, there is a risk that botulinum toxin A will prevent the bladder from emptying. If this happened, you would need to insert a catheter (a thin tube) into your bladder several times per day to empty. However, the side effects are usually temporary. The decrease in leakage with botulinum toxin A injection can last six to nine months or longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation</strong> &ndash; This treatment involves placing a hair-thin needle (like acupuncture) into a nerve near the ankle. This nerve is connected to nerves in the lower back that affect your bladder. The needle is connected to a small device that sends electrical pulses to the nerve. The treatment is not painful. This treatment is performed in a health care clinician's office once per week for 12 weeks and, if needed, can be continued monthly for maintenance. However, you must not use this treatment (it is &ldquo;contraindicated&rdquo;) if you have a cardiac pacemaker or infection or severe swelling of your ankles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sacral neuromodulation </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>A sacral nerve stimulator (SNS) is a device, about the size of a pacemaker, which can be surgically implanted. The device is placed under the skin in the upper buttock and is connected with wires to a nerve (the sacral nerve) in the lower back. The device sends electrical pulses to the sacral nerve, which helps people with urgency incontinence, urgency and frequency, or urinary retention who have not improved with other treatments. It is similar to Botox in treating incontinence and can be tested first before the permanent implant is placed. After you have the implant, it is generally not considered safe to ever have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to the components in the implant; however, check with your clinician to see if it may possibly be considered safe depending on the type of implant and MRI being considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Potential risks of the surgery include pain at the site where the unit is implanted (in the buttocks), movement of the device over time, infection, and others. More detailed information about sacral nerve stimulation is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome-beyond-the-basics#H17\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Electrical stimulation for painful bladder'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER MEASURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Pads</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While pads are not a recommended treatment for incontinence, they are necessary in some cases. Pads and protective undergarments are available in a variety of sizes and absorbencies, depending upon how much you leak. Pads designed for menstrual bleeding are usually not typically adequate.</p><p>Information on pad varieties and other urinary incontinence supplies is available from medical supply companies and urinary incontinence advocacy groups (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Where to get more information'</a> below). The United States National Association for Continence has an <a href=\"https://www.nafc.org/female-products/?rq=pad&amp;token=wEsKVFvqlKzpT+qOtddW/+CQwtBfZKjjS+mpwE4PyL51lwq7aqnwgmJfAAUPUPqFbDZ5mq6FAaqOS9LbQlmWKw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=14611\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">online tool</a> that can help you to choose a protective garment.</p><p>Whatever pad you choose, it is important to keep your skin dry and to control urine odor. If your skin is exposed to urine for long periods, it can become irritated and can potentially develop skin burns or infection. Use of zinc-based barrier products can help protect the skin (ie, zinc oxide). Protective products for the bed or other furniture may also be needed.</p><p>Pads are expensive and are not usually covered by insurance; in the United States, some state Medicaid plans cover the cost of pads for people with very limited incomes. In other countries, pads may be obtained for no or little cost through continence advisor nurses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Portable toilet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have difficulty walking, talk to your health care clinician. You may benefit from a portable toilet that can be placed close to your bed or living area. In addition, move electrical cords, throw rugs, or furniture out of hallways and walkways so that you do not trip or fall on the way to the bathroom.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare clinician is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=14611\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
