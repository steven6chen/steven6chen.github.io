The exact definition of these clinical syndromes is unclear as different criteria and terminologies are frequently used. Most clinical trials do not report the details of pulmonary toxicity, and literature reports may describe pulmonary toxicity based upon clinical or radiographic criteria (eg, acute lung injury, pneumonitis, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)) or on pathologic findings (eg, diffuse alveolar damage, organizing pneumonia, neutrophilic alveolitis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60543 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of most of these syndromes are nonspecific and include cough, dyspnea, low-grade fever, and hypoxemia. Chills and sputum production are rarely reported, while constitutional symptoms, such as weight loss, may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-systemic-antineoplastic-therapy-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Lung auscultation may reveal bibasilar crackles, but is often normal. Wheezing is rare, but when present, suggests a hypersensitivity mechanism with a component of bronchoconstriction. A concomitant morbilliform rash would provide evidence of hypersensitivity to a drug, such as drug-induced hypersensitivity (DIHS), also known as drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-pathogenesis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'IVb'</a>.)</p><p>The timing of the clinical manifestations is variable; they may present early during the first cycle of therapy or with subsequent treatment courses.

Depending on the clinical scenario, discontinuation of an agent on suspicion alone may deprive the patient of a potentially life-prolonging treatment (eg, a patient who develops pulmonary infiltrates while receiving adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> for HER2-positive early breast cancer).

In general, suspicion of significant lung toxicity justifies discontinuation of the drug. However, the clinician involved in the decision-making process must carefully weigh risks and benefits, as well as the availability of alternative treatments, as drug discontinuation may result in elimination of a highly effective agent.</p><p>An exception to this rule is the differentiation syndrome seen in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who are treated with a differentiating agent (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arsenic-trioxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arsenic trioxide</a>).

The evidence to support benefit of glucocorticoids in the setting of drug-induced lung toxicity is largely observational [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-systemic-antineoplastic-therapy-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Additional support comes from the observation that a histopathologic pattern consistent with glucocorticoid responsiveness (eg, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia) is often observed in patients with acute or subacute onset of pulmonary toxicity who undergo lung biopsy. However, clinicians are often faced with choosing whether to initiate systemic glucocorticoids before a histopathologic diagnosis is available.</p><p>For patients who have stable or improving pneumonitis, with the exception of the differentiation syndrome described above, glucocorticoids are generally withheld while observing for spontaneous improvement, as resolution of pulmonary toxicity often accompanies drug discontinuation.</p><p>In contrast, empiric glucocorticoid therapy is usually initiated in a patient who has rapidly progressive or more severe pulmonary toxicity, although evidence from randomized trials to support this practice is lacking. Severe lung toxicity is characterized by dyspnea at rest, a decrease in oxygen saturation below 90 percent or more than a 4 percent decrease from baseline, worsening clinical status, or the need for ventilatory support. According to the National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria (NCI-CTC) used to grade the severity of <span class=\"nowrap\">pneumonitis/pulmonary</span> infiltrates, this severity constitutes grade 3 or 4 toxicity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61493 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Possible exceptions to the empiric use of glucocorticoids would include patients with a strong contraindication to glucocorticoids and those with evidence of a disease process that is unlikely to be glucocorticoid-responsive, such as veno-occlusive disease or advanced usual interstitial pneumonia.

If the patient's response permits, tapering of the oral dose can be carried out over one to two months. Systemic glucocorticoid therapy is associated with a number of adverse effects, including opportunistic infection. Depending on the degree of immunosuppression due to concomitant agents, hematopoietic cell transplantation, underlying malignancy, or AIDS, prophylaxis may be indicated.

Several authors recommend that bleomycin be discontinued if the DLCO falls to less than 60 percent of an individual's baseline value. The US Food and Drug Administration-approved package insert recommends frequent chest radiographs in patients receiving bleomycin, and optional monthly determinations of DLCO with discontinuation of drug when the DLCO falls to below 30 to 35 percent of the pretreatment value. However, many other institutions do not routinely monitor DLCO during bleomycin therapy. </p><p>Monitoring of uptake on 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is being evaluated as another potential screening method. Increased uptake on PET scanning has been reported in patients with pneumonitis caused by several different antineoplastic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-systemic-antineoplastic-therapy-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>].

A lung biopsy is indicated when the patient has progressive or severe disease and the cause of the pneumonitis is uncertain. Drug-induced lung disease can cause a broad spectrum of histologic patterns.
