This number is expected to grow due to improvements in cancer screening, increases in life expectancy following definitive cancer treatment, and the aging of the population. Despite these improvements, the late effects of treatment, in particular those related to chemotherapy, have become more concerning to patients. These late effects may include what patients have termed &quot;chemobrain&quot; or &quot;chemofog,&quot; which can persist in some patients long after treatment has ended.</p><p>This topic will discuss cognitive function changes after cancer treatment, particularly as they relate to chemotherapy. Cognitive function following craniospinal irradiation, as well as other issues in cancer survivorship, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed complications of cranial irradiation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H171367\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT OF CANCER AND CANCER TREATMENT ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H811910843\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurobiologic basis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms by which cancer and cancer treatment impact cognitive function have not been elucidated. Some investigators have proposed that cancer treatment can either shift the trajectory of normal cognitive aging or accelerate the aging process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Evidence that chemotherapy-related cognitive dysfunction is accompanied by structural changes in the central nervous system comes from cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, most of which included breast cancer patients who were treated with chemotherapy months to years earlier; the control groups consisted of healthy individuals and breast cancer patients not treated with chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Patients who received chemotherapy were more likely than controls to manifest a long-term persisting diffuse decrease in gray matter and white matter volumes post-treatment, and these changes correlated with neurocognitive deficits. <br/><br/>New research suggests that chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment may be related not only to altered neuronal integrity, but also to disruption of brain structural networks that process and integrate information across the brain. In a prospective study of 64 men with newly diagnosed testicular cancer who underwent orchiectomy, patients underwent baseline and six-month follow-up neurocognitive testing and MRI scanning, which provided data to construct theoretical brain structure networks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Twenty-two men received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> and 42 had surveillance only. At six-month follow-up, compared with the surveillance group, men who had chemotherapy exhibited altered neuronal integrity and disruption of structural networks, as well as poorer cognitive performance. Patients with lower cognitive reserve appeared to be more vulnerable to these changes and to postchemotherapy cognitive decline. </p><p>It is likely that many mechanisms contribute to cognitive decline in cancer patients, including inflammation, direct neurotoxic effects of treatments, and damage to progenitor cells, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, it is also likely that the observed cognitive dysfunction in some patients reflects an <strong>interaction</strong> between multiple factors. As an example, in one review of the literature, the multifactorial nature of cognitive deficits in breast cancer patients was discussed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Factors other than chemotherapy were deemed to be important beyond the impact from surgery or medical therapy. These included psychological states (eg, depression, anxiety), the presence of fatigue or menopause, and other comorbid conditions. The authors highlighted the need for larger studies to better understand both the magnitude and mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in this population. Another potential interacting factor is lower pretreatment cognitive reserve, which may make patients more vulnerable to postchemotherapy cognitive decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,9</a>]. </p><p>It is important to note that the incidence of cognitive changes (due to chemotherapy predominantly) has been primarily conducted in patients treated with either hematological or breast malignancies. Earlier studies were retrospective and primarily within a year of undergoing treatment. Later studies have included prospective designs and longer follow-ups, with attempts to identify risk factors for developing chemotherapy-related cognitive changes as well as identify the underlying mechanisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H171447\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific cognitive complaints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals who have been treated with chemotherapy may bring out issues related to cognition in a variety of ways. As examples, patient complaints taken from our practice include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;I have complete memory blocks&quot; </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;My mind feels like jello&hellip;&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Some days I feel like a ditz&quot; </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;I cannot multi-task&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;I lose my place and attention when trying to read&quot;</p><p/><p>While the complaints may be subtle, they should be taken seriously by the patient&rsquo;s clinicians and medical providers. If the complaints persist months after the cessation of treatment and are impacting a patient&rsquo;s quality of life, including performance at work or home, a referral for neuropsychological evaluation is indicated in order to help with the differential with respect to the etiology of the cognitive issues and to help guide subsequent management.</p><p>Studies have reported a fairly consistent pattern regarding the experience of cognitive impairment, such that declines tend to be in the realms of memory, processing speed, and complex attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, there has been a lack of consistency between studies assessing cognitive outcomes in cancer patients with respect to design and defining cognitive impairment. For example, one comprehensive review of the literature highlighted the discrepancies in the assessment of cognitive functioning, particularly among patients who have undergone chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lack of a set standard to define cognitive impairment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variability in which neuropsychological tests were utilized </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The range of statistical analyses employed across studies</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H171492\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATING COGNITIVE FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The routine assessment of cognitive function (either before or after treatment) is not a standard practice, and evaluation is typically reserved for patients in whom cognitive impairment is negatively impacting quality of life or functional performance.</p><p>In general, assessments are mostly done as part of clinical research rather than as part of routine clinical practice. Most investigators include measures of neuropsychological functioning that characterize both cognitive domains and intellectual function at baseline, during treatment, and into follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As with most clinical research, control for bias is important, which is done through the use of prospective designs, incorporating control groups, and assessing for any cognitive decline compared with baseline using validated measures.</p><p>There are a number of methods to assess changes in cognitive function. One example is called the reliable change index (RCI). The RCI is the difference between two obtained scores for an individual divided by the standard error of the difference of the test utilized. It is a quantification of how much an individual score has changed and whether or not that change is reliable and clinically significant. It was initially described by Jacobson and Truax and has since been utilized by a variety of researchers. However, other investigators have made adjustments to the index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In order to help further our understanding of the cognitive late effects of cancer treatment, an international task force has proposed a set of core neuropsychological tests and recommended guidelines for assessing cognitive change and standardizing cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The data associated with cognitive impairment and these tumors are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21781044\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few studies assessing the cognitive impact from the treatment of brain tumors, as it is difficult to parcel out the roles of the tumor itself and cranial irradiation effects with respect to any neuropsychological changes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation#H4139131\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed complications of cranial irradiation&quot;, section on 'Neurocognitive effects'</a>.)</p><p>However, as the disease-free survival rate improves for these patients with the use of adjunctive chemotherapy, the cognitive outcomes will likely become more important to assess. The impact of treatment on cognition was shown in a phase II study in patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> (Avastin), all of whom underwent neuropsychological testing at baseline and every six weeks posttreatment to assess cognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Those who showed an objective response and survival over six months showed cognitive impairments at baseline relative to the general population, but had improved scores at the 24-week time point. Those who had progressive disease showed a decline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21781050\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematologic malignancies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may develop evidence of post-transplant cognitive decline, although in many cases, baseline cognitive dysfunction is present prior to HCT, possibly because they have previously received chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. As an example, in one prospective study where a fairly liberal definition of cognitive decline was utilized (performance one standard deviation below the mean compared with normative data), 58 percent of patients were classified as having a baseline cognitive impairment prior to HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>In the setting of HCT, at least some data suggest that the intensity of the conditioning regimen influences the risk and timing of post-treatment cognitive impairment. In a longitudinal prospective study of 477 HCT recipients (236 autologous, 128 reduced-intensity allogeneic, 113 standard myeloablative allogeneic), those undergoing a full-intensity allogeneic HCT were at greatest risk of cognitive decline post-treatment, which was present at six months and persisted beyond three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Individuals undergoing reduced-intensity allogeneic HCT had evidence of delayed decline in cognitive functioning (primarily in visual memory and fine motor dexterity) that did not emerge until three years post-transplant, and cognitive functioning was largely spared in most patients after autologous HCT. At three years post-HCT, global cognitive impairment was present in 19 percent of autologous HCT recipients compared with 36 percent of allogeneic HCT recipients. Older age, male sex, lower education, income, and pretreatment cognitive reserve were all associated with post-HCT cognitive impairment. </p><p>Others have noted the following risk factors for post-treatment cognitive decline: cognitive reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], educational level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], disease and health status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/8,16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16,19</a>], use of total body irradiation (TBI) as a component of the conditioning regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], chronic graft-versus-host disease, and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Affective state has not necessarily emerged as a contributor to cognitive <span class=\"nowrap\">changes/impairments</span> in group studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18</a>], though in individual patients, this can certainly be a factor. </p><p>Follow-up studies have shown that cognitive dysfunction may improve over time, but this has mainly been observed in individuals undergoing autologous HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/8,19,21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19,21-26</a>]. Studies that focused on allogenic HCT mostly show a decline in cognitive impairment over time with limited recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/20,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,27,28</a>]. Special care must be given to the psychological health of the transplant survivor and that of their <span class=\"nowrap\">spouse/partner,</span> and involvement of mental health providers in the long-term care of the transplant survivor is essential. Recommendations for post-transplant evaluation and management are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship#H94492458\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The approach to hematopoietic cell transplantation survivorship&quot;, section on 'Psychosocial and neurologic health'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21781056\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cognitive late effects of chemotherapy have been studied extensively in patients treated for breast cancer. As examples:</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 17 studies focusing on survivors treated with standard-dose chemotherapy for longer than six months, the authors found evidence for cognitive impairment, primarily in the domains of verbal and visuospatial abilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Relevant modifiers (age, education, time since treatment, adjunct hormonal treatment) did not emerge as significant modifiers.</p><p>As an example of the scope of the problem, in one case-control study involving 581 patients with breast cancer and 364 noncancer controls, 37 percent of patients reported a decline in cognitive function at six months follow-up after chemotherapy relative to pretreatment, versus 14 percent of controls over the same time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a longitudinal study, declines in processing speed were noted in women treated with chemotherapy compared with control groups, notably in those individuals who were older and had a lower cognitive reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Beyond chemotherapy, data suggest that endocrine therapy (eg, selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors) can negatively impact cognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. However, the data have not been consistently reported and require further evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Imaging studies in this patient population have also been conducted and provide additional evidence of the potential impact of cytotoxic chemotherapy on the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/36-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-41</a>].</p><p>Studies have identified clinical factors associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline. For example, studies have shown that baseline fatigue, anxiety, depression, and decreased cognitive reserve and functional well-being predict cognitive decline in patients treated with chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In one study, older individuals with lower cognitive reserve exposed to chemotherapy had lower scores on tests of processing speed compared with controls and a group that did not have chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, potential molecular factors may predict for an increased predisposition to cognitive difficulties. While still quite preliminary, apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/14,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,42,43</a>] and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-valine genotype have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H942168680\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence suggests that some patients may experience cognitive decline with chemotherapy treatments for ovarian cancer, though further study is needed to identify those patients at highest risk of impairment.</p><p>A study of 230 patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer utilized web-based cognitive screening assessments and self-reporting to examine processing speed, attention, and motor reaction times before, during, and after chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In this study, approximately 25 percent of patients experienced a decline in at least one of these areas during treatment, though the proportion fell to 18 percent six months following therapy. Typically, impairments were limited to just one area of function. Exploratory analyses suggested that cognitive decline with chemotherapy was associated with patient&rsquo;s age and education level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3160405118\"><span class=\"h2\">Colon cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with colorectal cancer may experience cognitive decline relative to healthy controls irrespective of chemotherapy treatment and stage of disease.</p><p>A study of almost 300 patients with localized colorectal cancer and approximately 70 healthy controls assessed the effect of colorectal cancer on cognition using neuropsychological assessments at baseline (prior to chemotherapy, if given) and at six-month intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Cognitive impairment was more frequent at baseline among the colorectal cancer patients than the healthy controls (43 versus 15 percent), and the difference persisted at the later assessments (6 and 12 months). Attention, memory, verbal learning, and processing speed were the most affected parameters. Among patients with colorectal cancer, there were no differences in cognitive assessments at any time point between those who received chemotherapy and those who did not. Additionally, 73 patients with metastatic cancer were compared with the patients with localized cancer and found to have similar levels of cognitive impairment. There were no associations between other modifiers (cognitive symptoms, fatigue, cytokine levels, and APOE4 allele) and cognitive impairment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21781062\"><span class=\"h2\">Childhood cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, individuals who were treated at a young age with higher doses of cranial irradiation may incur greater deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Fortunately, due to changes in treatment protocols, the late cognitive effects in individuals treated for leukemia tend to be lower today than the original reports that dated back to the early 1980s. Multiple factors are associated with the reported incidence of cognitive decline, including the age of the child during treatment and type of treatment received. In addition, a preexisting history of a learning disability may make someone more vulnerable to developing late cognitive effects. These issues are particularly relevant given other data suggesting that childhood cancer survivors may have an increasing incidence of frailty, which may represent a more rapid aging process compared with their peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>In adolescent and adult survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), neuropsychological late effects may be apparent and seem to be dependent on the factors as above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In studies assessing the late effects of chemotherapy (which is used as a central nervous system [CNS] prophylaxis), primarily intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (IT-MTX), the results are variable.

While there are studies assessing its usefulness in improving the quality of life in cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], there are no studies looking at its efficacy in improving cognition per se.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical exercise programs &ndash; Although physical exercise is associated with improved cognition in a variety of studies (notably in children and older adults), studies in patients who have undergone chemotherapy are lacking. Still, given the overall benefits of exercise in these patients, it is a reasonable recommendation for patients with cognitive concerns. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-roles-of-diet-physical-activity-and-body-weight-in-cancer-survivorship\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The roles of diet, physical activity, and body weight in cancer survivorship&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occupational therapy &ndash; This is usually referred to as cognitive rehabilitation, which is typically done by some speech therapists, occupational therapists, and neuropsychologists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-rehabilitation-for-cancer-survivors#H1241192\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical rehabilitation for cancer survivors&quot;, section on 'Cognitive dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain-training programs &ndash; Brain-training computer-based programs (sometimes referred to as neurobics) aim to use repetitive mental exercises to increase the brain&rsquo;s performance. These are commercially available and may be quite expensive. Memory and speed of processing computer training was assessed in a group of breast cancer patients compared with a wait-list control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. While both showed some efficacy, speed of processing improvements resulted in transfer to other domains.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electroencephalography (EEG) biofeedback &ndash; This technique, also termed neurofeedback, was assessed in a small group of breast cancer patients with self-reported cognitive impairments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The treatment resulted in improvement in cognitive measures, fatigue, psychological scales, and sleep. These improvements were maintained at four weeks posttreatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group cognitive rehabilitation intervention &ndash; A randomized clinical study of 48 cancer survivors demonstrated that small-group intervention, including psychoeducation and cognitive exercises, led to improvements in patients&rsquo; self-reported cognitive complaints as well as memory on neurocognitive testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychoeducation &ndash; This entails educating patients regarding the possible cognitive late effects of treatment and is important as they transition from cancer patients to cancer survivors.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172698\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacological treatment may be an appropriate intervention in order to improve cognition in patients previously treated for cancer. However, the data to support its use are limited, and no randomized clinical trials have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/72-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-75</a>]. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Modafinil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> are two CNS stimulants that have been evaluated in patients with cognitive declines after cancer treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/72,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,74,75</a>]. The limited data suggest they may improve cognitive function, although formal randomized trials specifically evaluating their impact on cognitive function have not been performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=donepezil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Donepezil</a> &ndash; Donepezil is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor indicated to treat Alzheimer-type dementia. In one phase II trial that included 35 patients with a brain tumor, treatment with donepezil significantly improved multiple areas of cognition (including <span class=\"nowrap\">attention/concentration,</span> verbal and figural memory) at 24 weeks compared with baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-function-after-cancer-and-cancer-treatment/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172826\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with cancer, the late effects of treatment, in particular those related to chemotherapy, may include cognitive problems, which have been termed &quot;chemobrain&quot; or &quot;chemofog.&quot; These issues can persist in some patients long after treatment has ended. (See <a href=\"#H21781038\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanism by which cancer and cancer treatment impacts cognition has not been entirely elucidated. Some propose that cancer and cancer treatment may have an adverse effect on age-related cognitive changes. Others have conceptualized the interaction as a &quot;soil, seed, and pesticides&quot; model. In this model (see <a href=\"#H171367\" class=\"local\">'Impact of cancer and cancer treatment on cognitive function'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The &quot;soil&quot; includes host-related factors (ie, what the individuals themselves provide in the development and treatment reactivity to cancer) such as genetics, immune reactivity, nutrition, and cognitive reserve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The &quot;seed&quot; refers to disease-related factors, including the cancer itself. It also includes tumor genetics, mutations, cytokines, and paraneoplastic disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The &quot;pesticides&quot; include treatments for the cancer. Although chemotherapy is used in the model, one could also extend it to include hormonal treatments and radiation therapy (RT). The mechanisms by which chemotherapy can impact cognition and brain function are not entirely understood. Many factors have been suggested, but none are mutually exclusive to the risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The routine assessment of cognitive function (either before or after treatment) is not standard clinical practice, and evaluation is reserved for patients in whom cognitive impairment is negatively impacting quality of life or functional performance. (See <a href=\"#H171492\" class=\"local\">'Evaluating cognitive function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive dysfunction can be apparent in various cancers at the time of diagnosis and can range from as high as 90 percent in patients with a brain tumor, 20 to 30 percent in adult patients with leukemia, to between 17 and 75 percent in patients with breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H171427\" class=\"local\">'Specific cancers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A combination of both behavioral and pharmacological treatments is likely to result in improved cognitive functioning and perceived improvement in quality of life in cancer survivors. In addition, psychoeducation of patients and partners has been shown to help improve affective state and develop coping strategies.
