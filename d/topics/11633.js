It is characterized by two primary features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thickening and hardening of the skin overlying the extremities and trunk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked expansion and fibrosis of the dermis in association with CD34-positive fibrocytes</p><p/><p>NSF was originally named nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD) because of the characteristic skin findings. However, subsequent studies showed that some patients had fibrosis of deeper structures, including muscle, fascia, lungs, and heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Because of the systemic findings, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is preferred to nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Systemic involvement'</a> below.)</p><p>NSF has also been called dialysis-associated systemic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, this term is too narrow since the disease is not limited to patients on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSF occurs exclusively in patients with kidney failure. The first cases were noted between 1997 and 2000 in hemodialysis patients or patients with failed renal allografts who developed severe skin induration that was histologically thought to be scleromyxedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Subsequent reports have mostly involved patients on hemodialysis but also included patients on peritoneal dialysis, renal transplant recipients (typically with reduced allograft function), patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), and patients with acute renal failure not requiring dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/4,9-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9-17</a>].</p><p>The number of cases has declined dramatically since initial reports, most certainly due to the avoidance of gadolinium-containing agents among at-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. As of January 2013, over 400 cases of NSF had been reported to the International NSF Registry at Yale University [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Almost all cases were in adults, but children were also affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. By 2010, the number of cases reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Events Reporting System peaked at over 500, but the overwhelming majority of cases reported in 2010 related to events that occurred much earlier. By 2011, the number of reported cases decreased to approximately 150 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F86395\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86395 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Due to limitations of the Adverse Events Reporting System, reported cases are not necessarily confirmed cases, and duplicate reporting of a single case cannot be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Cases have been reported many years after exposure, which highlights the need to consider the diagnosis if clinical features are present, even if exposure was not recent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>There is no predilection to NSF by gender, race, or age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]; etiology of kidney disease; or duration of renal failure. However, patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, compared with hemodialysis, may be at higher risk. As an example, a case-control study found that, over a four-year period, the attack rate after exposure to gadolinium was higher for peritoneal dialysis than for hemodialysis patients (4.6 cases per 100 peritoneal dialysis patients versus 0.61 cases per 100 hemodialysis patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The relationship between time of dialysis initiation to diagnosis of NSF can vary, ranging from 2 months to 15 years in one series of 12 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Cases have been reported in the United States, Europe, and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Clustering of cases suggests that NSF is underdiagnosed by clinicians who are unfamiliar with the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A retrospective analysis of two large tissue repositories failed to identify any cases presenting before 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These observations suggest that NSF is truly a new disease, which is probably due to exposure of patients with advanced renal failure to a new medication, infectious agent, or toxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Increasing evidence has implicated gadolinium-containing contrast agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gadolinium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gadolinium (Gd) is a nonradioactive, paramagnetic element in the lanthanide series. Gd<sup>+3</sup> ions closely approximate Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in size, and, consequently, gadolinium ions are effective (and toxic) calcium channel blockers. Gadolinium is the active element of several nontissue-specific, hyperosmolal (650 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span> contrast agents that are primarily administered during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or MR angiography studies. Because of its toxicity, Gd<sup>+3</sup> is bound to a proprietary ligand (or chelate). The chelates can be ionic or nonionic and linear or cyclical. Generally, ionic and cyclic chelates bind gadolinium more strongly than nonionic or linear chelates, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Binding of Gd<sup>+3</sup> ions reduces their interaction with tissues and facilitates their excretion.</p><p>Gadolinium-containing contrast agents differ by biochemical structure and charge and can be divided into three groups based on thermodynamic and kinetic stability, which in order from least to most stable are ionic linear, nonionic linear, and macrocyclic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30</a>]. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents and their stability constants are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F109092\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109092 \">table 1</a>)<em>.</em> Higher values of the stability constant indicate a lower rate of dissociation of free gadolinium ion (Gd<sup>3+</sup>) from its ligand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Most gadolinium-containing contrast agents are excreted unchanged almost exclusively by the kidney. Their half-life is 1.3 hours in healthy volunteers, 10 hours at an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> and 34 hours in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, the half-life is reduced dramatically to between 1.9 to 2.6 hours if hemodialysis follows the administration of gadolinium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. A discussion of issues surrounding dialysis after gadolinium exposure is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'If gadolinium must be given'</a> below.)</p><p>One agent, gadoxetic acid (Eovist or Primovist) undergoes significant biliary clearance, which may make it desirable for patients with mild to moderated reduced kidney function. In a small pharmacokinetic study of patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> the elimination half-life of gadoxetic acid was 2.8 hours as compared with 1.8 hours in healthy controls, and there was a nonsignificant trend towards a greater fractional excretion via the biliary system in these respective patient groups (41 versus 31 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, similar to other gadolinium-based contrast agents, the half-life of gadoxetic acid in ESRD patients was markedly elevated at 20 hours, and, thus, dialysis would still be needed if it were to be administered to an ESRD patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'If gadolinium must be given'</a> below.)</p><p>At physiologic pH, macrocyclic chelates are less likely to dissociate than linear chelates, although NSF has been noted with both types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This has led to the hypothesis that excess exposure to free Gd<sup>3+</sup> in patients with kidney disease leads to tissue damage. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Role of free gadolinium'</a> below.)</p><p>Support for the pathogenic role of gadolinium comes from the demonstration of gadolinium deposition in tissue specimens of some patients with NSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/17,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,35-38</a>]. In one report, for example, gadolinium was noted in 4 of 13 specimens in seven patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. It was suggested that gadolinium had a tissue residence time of 4 to 11 months.</p><p>The first published report that suggested an association of gadolinium with NSF appeared in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Between 2006 and 2008, more than 300 cases linking gadolinium with NFD were published.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case series from Austria, NSF developed in five of nine hemodialysis patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadodiamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadodiamide</a> (Omniscan) for MR angiography, a technique that may require up to three times the contrast dose used in routine MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

There was no correlation with age, sex, underlying renal disease, drug therapy, dialysis modality, or comorbid conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case series from Denmark, 13 patients with ESRD (7 on hemodialysis, 1 on peritoneal dialysis, and 5 not requiring dialysis) developed symptoms of NSF a mean of 25 days (range 2 to 75 days) after exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadodiamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadodiamide</a> (Omniscan) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There was no correlation between gadodiamide dose and NSF severity. No other exposure or event could be identified that was common to more than a minority of the patients. Of note, 6 of the 13 patients had been previously exposed to gadolinium without developing NSF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a detailed review of 75 cases of NSF performed by the US FDA, all had received a gadolinium-based contrast agent for an MR study 2 days to 18 months before disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Similar findings were noted by the International NSF registry: More than 95 percent of cases reported to the registry had been exposed to gadolinium within two to three months of disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective cohort study from Denmark, among 565 patients with renal insufficiency who were exposed to gadolinium-based contrast agents, 17 cases of NSF were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. By contrast, there were no cases of NSF among age- and sex-matched controls who had renal insufficiency but were not exposed to such agents. The prevalence of NSF was highest among patients with eGFR &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, including those on dialysis. However, three cases involved patients with eGFR between 15 and 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p/><p>NSF has been reported after the administration of the five most commonly used FDA-approved gadolinium-chelates in the United States (Magnevist, MultiHance, Omniscan, OptiMARK, and ProHance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The FDA added a boxed warning and new warnings to the product labeling about the risk of NSF with all gadolinium-based agents in 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>There is strong evidence that the risk of NSF is greater with linear than with macrocyclic preparations. As an example, in the United States, among cases in which the type of gadolinium preparation was reported, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadodiamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadodiamide</a> causes more than 80 percent of cases, with the remainder mostly due to gadopentetate. This cannot be explained by relative market share since gadopentetate has the highest share in the United States.</p><p>In addition, a retrospective study of the Veterans Affairs Electronic Medical Records found no cases of NSF among 141 patients with 198 single-agent exposures to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadoteridol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadoteridol</a> (a macrocyclic agent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The author also further analyzed MedWatch data reporting that 283, 125, 20, 10, and 9 cases were associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadodiamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadodiamide</a>, gadopentetate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadoversetamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadoversetamide</a>, gadobenate, and gadoteridol, respectively. These results may be explained in part by low market share for some formulations and significantly more exposures with gadopentetate compared with other formulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, there was only one case of NSF due to single-agent exposure to gadoteridol. The FDA revised the boxed warning in 2010, advising practitioners against the use of gadodiamide, gadoversetamide, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadopentetate-dimeglumine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadopentetate dimeglumine</a> (all linear agents) in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) with eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A separate issue is the magnitude of the risk after exposure to gadolinium, which varies by level of GFR. Most of the cases have been reported in chronic dialysis patients. The reported risk has ranged between 2.5 and 5 percent in studies of approximately 400 to 500 dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. Cases have been reported in patients with AKI. The risk in individuals with eGFR of 15 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> remains undefined, but cases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Risk of NSF is low in patients with CKD exposed to linear gadolinium agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a large, single-center, observational series of 3819 patients with severe CKD (eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) exposed to a linear gadolinium agent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadobenate-dimeglumine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadobenate dimeglumine</a>), no cases of NSF were observed during long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Similarly, there were no cases of NSF in two smaller cohorts of patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>There is some evidence that a dose-response relationship exists. This was illustrated in a report of 301 MRI studies with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadodiamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadodiamide</a> in dialysis patients: 207 were done with a double dose (0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg)</span> and 94 with a single dose (0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. All 12 NSF patients (8 chronic dialysis patients and 4 with acute hepatorenal syndrome) had received a double dose. The odds ratio for the development of NSF after a double versus single dose of gadodiamide was calculated at 22.3 (95% CI 1.3-378).</p><p>In another study, the cumulative dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadodiamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadodiamide</a> was higher among patients with more severe NSF (lifetime dose 0.5&plusmn;0.09 versus 0.33&plusmn;0.04 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The odds ratio for developing NSF after a 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span> gadodiamide dose compared with a 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span> dose (the maximum recommended dose) was estimated in another series as 12.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/3,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,47</a>].</p><p>Many centers have stopped using gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients on dialysis with eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> or immediately dialyze patients afterwards. A study from Johns Hopkins University reports a decrease in the incidence rate of NSF after increased screening, restricting use, reducing doses, and dialyzing immediately post-dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

This prompted researchers to examine the effect of gadolinium chelates on the expression and production of a panel of profibrotic and proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors by normal human peripheral blood monocytes in vitro. In response to the gadolinium chelates, a marked increase in expression was noted for interleukin (IL)-13, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13. There was also increased expression of TGF-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In contrast, the expression levels of two other cytokines examined, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, were not affected by exposure to any of the gadolinium-containing compounds. This indicated that the upregulation observed for the other cytokines and growth factors was not a nonspecific effect, but reflected a real monocyte response.

Brain deposition was first suggested by the findings of progressive T1 enhancement of the dentate nucleus and global pallidi (areas of the brain that are particularly vulnerable to heavy metal deposition) among patients undergoing repeated contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (MRIs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/99-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-101</a>]. Mass spectrometry of postmortem brain specimens from 13 individuals with normal kidney function who had undergone at least four contrast-enhanced MRIs confirmed histologic gadolinium deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

Macrocyclic compounds are preferred agents if a gadolinium-based contrast agent must be used and especially if repeated exposures are anticipated.</p><p>The amount of tissue deposition of gadolinium would be expected to be greater in patients with reduced kidney function given delayed excretion and elevated serum phosphate levels that may promote gadolinium dissociation from its ligand. Recommendations regarding the use of gadolinium among patients with reduced kidney function are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a fibrosing disorder seen only in patients with moderate to severe kidney failure, particularly patients on dialysis. As of January 2013, nearly 400 cases of NSF had been reported to the International NSF Registry at Yale University. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing evidence has implicated gadolinium-containing contrast agents, which are excreted exclusively by the kidney, as the cause of NSF. More than 95 percent of patients have had recent exposure to gadolinium, and the best estimate of risk of NSF after gadolinium exposure is approximately 2.5 to 5 percent among patients with severely impaired renal function. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine light microscopy of a skin biopsy will reveal a subtle proliferation of dermal fibrocytes in early lesions or marked thickening of the dermis with severe disease. Special testing may show gadolinium, which, in itself, does not establish a diagnosis of NSF. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inciting event is most likely the tissue deposition of gadolinium. This may result in exaggerated local tissue fibrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the direct stimulation of bone marrow to produce CD34+ circulating fibrocytes. The latter cells subsequently accumulate in the affected tissue and produce collagen. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin involvement occurs in all patients, while only some have systemic manifestations. The latent period between exposure to gadolinium and disease onset is usually two to four weeks. The skin disease presents with plaques, papules, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nodules, with the affected skin becoming thickened and firm and possibly assuming a <em>peau d' orange</em> (orange peel-like) appearance. Manifestations of systemic involvement may include muscle induration, joint contracture, and fibrosis of the lungs, pleura, diaphragm, myocardium, pericardium, and dura mater. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is based upon histopathologic examination of a biopsy of an involved site. Although thickening and hardening of the skin overlying the extremities and trunk can simulate a variety of other disorders such as scleroderma, scleromyxedema, and eosinophilic fasciitis, a history of a temporally associated gadolinium exposure in the setting of advanced kidney failure is strongly suggestive of NSF. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> or those on dialysis, we recommend <strong>NOT</strong> administering gadolinium-containing contrast agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>), unless clinical conditions make gadolinium-based imaging absolutely necessary. In general, among patients with this degree of renal dysfunction, we prefer the risk of radiocontrast nephropathy with iodinated contrast media (using all of the preventive measures that are available) to the risk of the much more severe complication of NSF. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of gadolinium'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-contrast-nephropathy-associated-with-angiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of contrast nephropathy associated with angiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no consensus among the authors and reviewers of this topic as to whether or not gadolinium-based contrast agents should be administered to patients with an eGFR of 30 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. In general, it seems advisable to limit exposure of any patient with marginal renal function to the three gadolinium-based contrast agents deemed the highest risk. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The GFR can be estimated from the serum creatinine concentration but <strong>ONLY</strong> in patients who have a stable value.

In this setting, we suggest the following approach:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The patient should be informed of the benefits, risks, and alternatives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Given that the great majority of cases of NSF have followed imaging with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadodiamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadodiamide</a> (Omniscan), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadoversetamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadoversetamide</a> (OptiMARK), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadopentetate-dimeglumine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadopentetate dimeglumine</a> (Magnevist), we suggest giving one of the other commercially available gadolinium preparations (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadoteridol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadoteridol</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The lowest dose that is deemed necessary should be given.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among patients undergoing chronic or acute dialysis (both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) and patients not on dialysis who have an eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and a functioning chronic hemodialysis vascular access, we recommend initiating a hemodialysis session as soon as possible (within hours, not days) after gadolinium administration (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter should be performed in peritoneal dialysis patients without a functioning vascular access.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Given the time required to place a hemodialysis catheter and perform hemodialysis, an attempt should be made to schedule elective imaging studies at a time at which the patient has a functioning access so that hemodialysis can be performed just after the gadolinium is administered. A second hemodialysis session at 24 hours may be performed, if clinically safe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among patients with chronic or acute kidney failure who have an eGFR &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> are not on dialysis, and do not have a functioning vascular access, we suggest initiating a hemodialysis session as soon as possible after gadolinium administration (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gadolinium can deposit in tissues other than the skin, including the brain and bone, in a dose-dependent fashion in individuals with normal kidney function.
