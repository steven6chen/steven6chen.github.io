The procedure is typically performed by a urologist in the office setting.</p><p>Prostate biopsy techniques and periprocedural management will be reviewed here. Screening for prostate cancer and the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of prostate cancer are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although generally considered safe, prostate biopsy is an invasive procedure and recommendations for its use are limited to a defined subset of patients. However, the definition of this subset continues to evolve. Screening the general population for prostate cancer remains a controversial issue, since improved patient outcomes have not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. When screening is warranted, it is accomplished with digital rectal examination and measurement of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Findings on digital rectal examination that may indicate a need for prostate biopsy include the presence of nodules, induration, or asymmetry. Repeat biopsies may be indicated for inadequate initial sampling or continued high clinical suspicion for prostate cancer after initial negative biopsy based upon rising PSA levels or a variety of other PSA-based parameters (eg, PSA velocity, PSA density). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Improving the performance of PSA'</a> and <a href=\"#H2924776\" class=\"local\">'Need for repeat biopsy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer#H36\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Frequency and method of screening'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PROSTATE ANATOMY AND IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prostate gland is a firm walnut-shaped structure located at the base of the urinary bladder; the apex is caudal and the base cranial. The prostate is composed of both glandular and muscular tissue. Secretions from the prostate, vas deferens, and seminal vesicle empty into the prostatic urethra (ie, section of the urethra that traverses the prostate); each of these structures contributes to the composition of the semen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54803\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54803 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Zones of the prostate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prostate gland is divided into three general zones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57801\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57801 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral &ndash; Approximately 70 percent of the prostate gland is contained within the peripheral zone, and the majority of prostate cancers originate within this zone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central &ndash; The central zone comprises 25 percent of the volume of the normal prostate. The stroma of the prostate gland is the densest in this zone. Approximately 5 percent of prostate cancers originate within the central zone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transition &ndash; The transition zone comprises 5 percent of the normal volume of the prostate and is the site of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Approximately 10 percent of cancers originate within the transition zone</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging to guide biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostate biopsy can be performed with manual guidance, but accuracy is improved with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance, which is easy to perform, widely available, and generally well-tolerated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66789\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66789 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Although ultrasound alone has been the primary imaging modality used, other imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance (MR) imaging or computed tomography (CT), can also be used. Endorectal coil MR provides superior resolution of prostate anatomy and potential targets for biopsy (especially anterior tumors) compared with other noninvasive imaging procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, MR-targeted biopsy is limited by its long examination time, requirement for radiologic expertise, and lack of general availability. (See <a href=\"#H119732198\" class=\"local\">'MR-targeted biopsy'</a> below.) </p><p>For some patients (prior rectal resection or severe stenosis), a transrectal approach may not be possible necessitating CT or MR imaging to perform a transperineal biopsy (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Transperineal'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281620070\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two-dimensional TRUS is typically used for measuring prostate volume. Prostate height and width are measured in a longitudinal plane, and then the probe orientation is switched on the machine to measure length and width in the transverse plane. The software contains an algorithm that reliably computes prostate volume based upon these measurements. Three-dimensional TRUS can provide additional information about the location and extent of prostate cancer (eg, seminal vesicle invasion, extension through the prostatic capsule); however, three-dimensional imaging devices are not widely available in the office setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>The ultrasonographic characteristics of the prostate and its surrounding tissues correlate with underlying prostate histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The normal prostate has a uniform echotexture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76064\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76064 \">image 1</a>). The prostate should be visualized in both the sagittal and longitudinal planes and the overall echotexture of the prostate and seminal vesicles are assessed and correlated with the findings of digital rectal exam. Hypoechoic lesions and those that correlate with an abnormality on digital rectal ultrasound have a higher likelihood of harboring cancer; however, up to one-third of (and possibly more) of prostate cancers are isoechoic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Hyperechoic areas represent areas of prostatic calcification (ie, stones).</p><p>Prostate measurements are recorded. Prostate volume and PSA density (PSA <span class=\"nowrap\">level/prostate</span> volume) are easily determined and may aid in determining the sample size on prostate biopsy. Patients with larger prostates (eg, those with benign prostatic hypertrophy) may have higher than normal PSA levels due to increased prostate volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-prostate-specific-antigen#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of prostate-specific antigen&quot;, section on 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-prostate-specific-antigen#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of prostate-specific antigen&quot;, section on 'PSA density'</a>.)</p><p>Enhanced ultrasound techniques including contrast enhanced Doppler ultrasound and elastosonography have been introduced to manage some of the limitations of traditional grayscale ultrasound-guided biopsy techniques, primarily the relatively low sensitivity for prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/12,16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16-20</a>]. </p><p>One technique uses Doppler imaging to identify areas of increased vascularity, which can be further augmented using contrast agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/21-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-28</a>]. Another technique, elastosonography, evaluates differences in tissue response to manual compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. Elastosonography has shown promise for enhancing the resolving power of ultrasound, and, although results are conflicting, several reports indicate that elastosonography is capable of identifying foci of cancer, with improved sensitivity for higher-grade cancers. Potential limitations of this technology include the need for specialized ultrasound probes and the reliance upon operator skill to define areas of differential elasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119732198\"><span class=\"h3\">MR-targeted biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MR-defined lesions can be targeted for biopsy in several ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/38-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-50</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive targeting refers to a method in which the physician identifies the lesion on MR and uses the anatomic information to select the area during TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeting within the magnet (in-bore targeting) is a technique in which MR is used to directly guide prostate biopsy in real-time. Guided biopsy under endorectal coil MRI has been advocated as an alternative for men with persistently elevated serum PSA and negative TRUS-guided biopsies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of registration or fusion software (eg, Koelis urostation) allows a lesion targeted on MR to be identified again during a later TRUS-guided biopsy procedure, either with or without a tracking device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p/><p>Among the MR-guided options listed above, the most useful for urologists, who perform the majority of prostate biopsies, may be the <span class=\"nowrap\">MRI/ultrasound</span> fusion-guided technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/47,49,52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,49,52-54</a>]. This technique may also enhance the ability to detect cancer among men with elevated PSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>Major technical improvements in prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with standard approach to interpretation using the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) have rapidly expanded the role of MRI in prostate cancer management in many clinical contexts, both prior to and following diagnosis, which is discussed in detail elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/50,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,56</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two main anatomic approaches to prostate biopsy are transrectal and transperineal. The transurethral approach can also be used to resect the prostate for pathologic analysis. Transrectal ultrasound-guided approaches are typically performed in the office setting, while CT or MRI-guided transperineal procedures are most often performed in an outpatient hospital setting by a radiologist alone or in conjunction with a urologist. Staging biopsy can be performed with any approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/10,11,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,57,58</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Transrectal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy is the most common approach for prostate sampling and is described in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'TRUS Biopsy procedure'</a> below.)</p><p>To improve the diagnostic accuracy of TRUS-guided biopsy, a template-guided TRUS technique (TargetScan) has been introduced to ensure more uniformly distributed sampling of the prostate. This technique, which is not widely available, is highly accurate in providing localizing information that correlates highly with abnormal pathologic findings identified in radical prostatectomy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Transperineal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative to transrectal biopsy of the prostate is a transperineal approach that can be used to perform a prostate biopsy in men who cannot undergo a transrectal procedure (eg, those with a prior abdominoperineal resection or severe anal stenosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/58,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,60</a>]. Transperineal biopsy can be performed with ultrasound, CT, or MR guidance and the overall diagnostic accuracy appears to be equivalent to that of TRUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>], but it is associated with an overall higher rate of complications compared with TRUS. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H399724752\"><span class=\"h3\">Template-guided</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A template-guided transperineal approach combines transrectal ultrasound with transperineal biopsy guided by a brachytherapy template [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. This enhanced localization augments the biopsy technique and may prove especially beneficial for repeat biopsy when premalignant pathology is found on initial biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H2924776\" class=\"local\">'Need for repeat biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p>Core samples are obtained at 5 mm intervals throughout the prostate. This approach may potentially provide more accurate staging in patients harboring prostate cancer, and its ability to accurately define tumor location may render this approach particularly helpful for determining suitability for focal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In addition, one study found that, in patients with rising prostate specific antigen (PSA), transperineal biopsy was able to detect prostate cancer in 39 percent of patients undergoing repeat biopsy with this technique after an initially negative transrectal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Potential disadvantages of this approach are the need for anesthesia, and a higher complication rate than with transrectal biopsy (7.7 percent in one report, with two patients requiring bladder irrigation for hematuria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1240595\"><span class=\"h2\">Transurethral resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in whom suspicion for prostate cancer remains high in spite of aggressive negative sampling, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. In a retrospective review, TURP detected cancer in 35 of 375 patients (9.3 percent) with one prior negative biopsy and in 6 of 35 patients with two prior negative biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are understandably anxious and may benefit from administration of an anxiolytic prior to undergoing prostate biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The presence of bacteriuria or an indwelling catheter at the time of biopsy increases the risk of postbiopsy urinary tract infection and other infectious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/69-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-72</a>]. Thus, a urinalysis should be performed prior to biopsy. If the urinary findings are suspicious for urinary tract infection (eg, pyuria with or without bacteriuria), the biopsy is postponed, urine cultures obtained, and a short course (five to seven days) of culture-appropriate antibiotics is administered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Genitourinary surgery'</a> and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended prior to prostate biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/73-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-76</a>]. The main effect of antibiotic prophylaxis is a lowered incidence of postbiopsy bacteriuria. Although not all patients with bacteriuria are symptomatic, all patients who develop infectious complications following rectal biopsy are bacteriuric. </p><p>Prostate biopsy performed without antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with increased rates of bacteriuria (8 to 44 percent) and bacteremia (16 to 70 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/69,70,77-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70,77-85</a>]. Major infectious complications, such as sepsis, Fournier gangrene, and urinary tract infection requiring hospital admission have been reported in patients who did not receive prophylactic antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. A metaanalysis of nine trials found that antibiotic administration prior to prostate biopsy significantly reduces the risk of bacteriuria (risk ratio [RR] 0.25, 95% CI, 0.15-0.42), bacteremia (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.92), fever (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23-0.64), urinary tract infection (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22-0.62), and the need for hospitalization (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.55) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. </p><p>Selection of antibiotics for genitourinary procedures is based upon coverage of skin and urinary tract flora which includes both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87199 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. In the metaanalysis, there were no significant differences between several classes of antibiotics for the outcomes tested (bacteriuria, bacteremia, fever and the need for hospitalization). No differences were identified for oral versus systemic (intravenous or intramuscular) antibiotics. Seven trials reported a one-day versus a three-day course of antibiotics. A single day of antibiotics was associated with an increased risk of bacteriuria (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.18-3.33) but there were no significant differences in the incidences of more important clinical outcomes. The data were insufficient to recommend multiple doses or a longer course of treatment. </p><p>Fluoroquinolones are the most widely used antibiotic for prophylaxis due to their broad spectrum of activity, easy oral administration, good penetration to prostate gland tissue, and long-lasting bactericidal activity. We use a single dose of an oral fluoroquinolone one hour prior to prostate biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87199 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>].

In a multinational study, fluoroquinolones were administered to 92.5 percent of patients. Post-biopsy urine culture was positive in 37 percent of symptomatic cases and 6 out of 10 of the bacterial isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. The increase in the incidence of antibiotic-resistant infections following prostate biopsy is felt to be responsible for an increasing need for hospitalization after prostate biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. A retrospective study evaluated the addition of an aminoglycoside (240 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>) to fluoroquinolone (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a>) and found significantly decreased infection rates after transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (0.6 versus 3.4 percent); the effect was not significant for gentamicin doses of 80 or 160 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Some have suggested rectal swab culture to isolate and characterize fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms prior to prostate biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/97-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-100</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.) </p><p>For procedures in which ultrasonography is performed, sterile ultrasound transmission gel should be used. Outbreaks of infection due to resistant organisms have been traced to contaminated gel from multiple-use tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Some authors have recommended formalin disinfection of the biopsy needle after each core is taken to minimize postbiopsy infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Rectal cleansing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rectal cleansing with enemas, suppositories, or iodine lavage is not necessary as long as appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis is provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. The potential benefit of enema administration or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a> lavage prior to prostate biopsy is based upon the supposition that these measures will reduce infectious complication due to transmission of bacteria from the rectal vault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. In patients who have received antibiotic prophylaxis, a clinically significant benefit from rectal cleansing has not been found. In addition to lack of benefit, improper or incomplete enema technique may hinder visualization and increase patient discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. </p><p>A systematic review identified four trials evaluating rectal preparation and found no significant differences for any outcome (bacteriuria, bacteremia, fever, urinary tract infection, the need for hospitalization) for prophylactic antibiotics versus enema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. A decreased risk of bacteremia, however, was found for the use of 'antibiotic plus enema' versus 'antibiotic' (relative risk 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.75). However, the authors noted that the quality of the evidence for these comparisons was overall poor because of the limited number of studies, patients and events. A subsequent randomized trial also did not find a significant benefit for rectal cleansing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiplatelet therapy/anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most men undergoing prostate biopsy are middle-aged or elderly with significant cardiovascular risk factors.

A preprocedure transrectal ultrasound and digital rectal examination are performed to confirm previous findings. The patient is placed in a lateral decubitus position, with the knees and hips flexed 90-degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. With appropriate lubrication, the ultrasound probe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75517\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75517 \">figure 3</a>) is gently inserted into the rectum. The application of a topical perianal or intrarectal anesthetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> gel, glyceryl trinitrate ointment) may reduce pain related to probe insertion, but does not provide adequate analgesia for prostate biopsy.

In addition, the administration of local analgesia does not appear to increase the rate of complications following prostate biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/117,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">117,120</a>].</p><p>Traditionally, pain control with local anesthesia has been achieved with the administration of plain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> (2.5 mL of 1% or 2%) injected at each junction between the seminal vesicle and the prostate (peri-prostatic nerve block), which is easily seen with ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/121,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">121,122</a>]. Some investigators have found that the addition of intraprostatic lidocaine administration may provide better analgesia than peri-prostatic blockade alone, despite the risk of increased pain at the time of administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/123-125\" class=\"abstract_t\">123-125</a>]. Periprostatic nerve block combined with various topical or local anesthetics significantly controlled pain better than nerve block alone in a systematic review that included 18 studies involving 2076 men undergoing ultrasound-guided biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>].

However, this method misses approximately 30 percent of clinically significant cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/134-137\" class=\"abstract_t\">134-137</a>]. Because of these data, sextant biopsy has been largely replaced by extended core biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18433713\"><span class=\"h3\">Extended core</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extended core biopsy is performed by obtaining five to seven evenly-distributed specimens from each side, sampling more extensively from the lateral aspects of the prostate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/49,136,138,139\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,136,138,139</a>]. A systematic review of 87 studies found that an increasing number of cores were significantly associated with increased detection of prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. Schemes with 12 core samples that took additional laterally directed cores detected 31 percent more cancers (95% CI 25-37) compared with a six-core approach.</p><p>Another method extends initial biopsy to include 18 cores. This approach may be more effective in detecting premalignant pathology, but the overall success in diagnosing true cancer appears to be equivalent to a 12 core biopsy, except for those patients with prostate volume exceeding 55 cm<sup>3</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>].</p><p>Compared with six core biopsy, extended core biopsy is not associated with an increased risk of infection, abdominal or rectal pain, or voiding difficulties. However, rectal bleeding and hematospermia may be more frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/140,142\" class=\"abstract_t\">140,142</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Prostate volume should also be taken into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/143,144\" class=\"abstract_t\">143,144</a>]. In a study of 500 men, for example, an eight-core prostate biopsy was sufficient for the detection of cancer in men whose prostate volume was less than 35 cm<sup>3</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. Including prostate volume may be best used in patients with a large prostate for whom the risk of prostate cancer may be sufficiently reduced such that proceeding with biopsy is not favored. As an example, a 65-year-old with PSA of 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and a prostate volume of 25 cc would have a predicted risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">cancer/high-grade</span> cancer of 60.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/20</span>.7 percent for a 6-core biopsy, and 68.<span class=\"nowrap\">3/39</span>.0 percent for 12-core biopsy, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>], whereas, if prostate volume were 90 cc, these predicted risks would decrease to 16.<span class=\"nowrap\">1/5</span>.1 percent for 6-core biopsy, and 21.<span class=\"nowrap\">1/11</span>.6 percent, respectively, for 12-core biopsy. </p><p>Age may also play an important role in guiding the number of core samples obtained. The Vienna nomogram, developed from a large European cohort of men with a serum PSA between 2 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> suggested that at a given prostate volume, fewer cores are needed as age increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>].</p><p>Issues related to repeat prostate biopsy are discussed below.

Saturation techniques do not provide increased cancer detection when used for first-time biopsy, but may provide increased sensitivity when repeat biopsies are performed and should be considered after two negative TRUS-biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/146-149\" class=\"abstract_t\">146-149</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2924776\" class=\"local\">'Need for repeat biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p>Saturation biopsy is typically performed in the outpatient setting under regional or general anesthesia due to concerns for pain control, and because it is thought to be associated with an increased incidence of morbidity (eg, severe hematuria) requiring hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/150,151\" class=\"abstract_t\">150,151</a>]. However, a systematic review that identified eight studies comparing saturation with extended biopsy found no significant differences in infection, hematuria, or bleeding between the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>].

As a result, some premalignant histology cannot be adequately distinguished from prostate cancer, even by an experienced pathologist. FNA of the prostate gland is particularly unreliable in men who have undergone hormonal or radiation therapy. However, FNA may have a role in confirming advanced prostate cancer or metastatic disease in men with a prior history of localized cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound-guided procedure and specimen handling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An 18 gauge spring-loaded core biopsy needle (eg, Tru-Cut) is advanced into the rectum adjacent to the ultrasound probe and guided into the prostate to obtain core samples, one at a time. Extended core biopsy is indicated for most patients, although a smaller number of cores may be adequate for patients with low prostate volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18433713\" class=\"local\">'Extended core'</a> above.)</p><p>The specimen is removed from the biopsy gun and examined. The core should measure 0.1 cm in diameter and 1.0 to 1.5 cm in length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. Inadequate cores require resampling from the same region. The specimens are labeled according to location before being sent for pathologic analysis.</p><p>For stereotactic biopsy, the cores are coded to a grid pinpointing both their &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; location and their depth. Using newer systematic transrectal biopsy approaches (ie, TargetScan biopsy), a machine that controls the ultrasound probe records the precise position of the probe for each biopsy site, allowing precise localization of prostate cancer and reproducible positioning on repeat biopsy.

Routine use of stool softeners after uncomplicated TRUS-guided biopsy is not necessary, although patients who develop prostatitis or urinary tract obstruction may benefit from their use.

A small amount of bright red blood per rectum is expected, but persistent rectal bleeding warrants immediate evaluation. Similar considerations apply to moderate hematuria, which should also be self-limited. Hematospermia is common after prostate biopsy, and discoloration of the semen may persist for weeks.

In contrast, face-to-face consultation with an appropriate specialist is warranted in patients with positive or suspicious pathology. Patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer will require additional staging prior to treatment.

When interpreting the pathology report, it should be determined whether an appropriate number of core samples were of adequate quality; a core sample is not adequate if prostatic glands or stroma are not visualized. Patients with a negative biopsy who have undergone inadequate (ie, low number of quality cores) or prior limited (ie, sextant) biopsy are at increased risk for a missed diagnosis of prostate cancer and should be considered for repeat biopsy. Another indication for repeat biopsy is the finding of abnormal but nonmalignant pathology (eg, small acinar proliferation).</p><p>The potential yield of a repeat biopsy was illustrated by a series of 10,400 men undergoing prostate biopsy in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) and Medicare database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]. The overall proportion of repeat biopsies found to contain prostate cancer was 32 percent and increased with age: 26 percent at 65 to 69 years; 31 percent at 70 to 74 years; 35 percent at 75 to 79 years; and 41 percent at &ge;80 years. Among men whose first recorded biopsy did not detect prostate cancer, the need to have a subsequent biopsy was 12 percent at one year and 38 percent at five years.</p><p>Similar findings were noted in other studies as prostate cancer was detected in up to 39 percent of patients at second biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/156-160\" class=\"abstract_t\">156-160</a>].

A majority of pathologists will not comment on findings of low-grade PIN, as evidence suggests that this histologic pattern is not premalignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. </p><p>High-grade PIN is a premalignant condition and is noted in 2 to 22 percent of extended core prostate biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/162,167,169\" class=\"abstract_t\">162,167,169</a>]. However, it is commonly overdiagnosed.

Among men enrolled in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Screening (PLCO) trial who underwent biopsy (negative biopsy result), the incidences of any complication, postbiopsy infection, and noninfectious complications were 2.0, 0.78, and 1.3 percent respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/185\" class=\"abstract_t\">185</a>]. On multivariate analysis, a history of prostate inflammation or enlargement (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% CI 1.6-4.3), and black race (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.9) were significantly associated with higher rates for any complication, while repeat biopsy was associated with a lower rate of noninfectious complications (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9). In a study of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, the rate of hospitalization within 30 days of undergoing a prostate biopsy was 6.9 percent compared with 2.7 in a control population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The need to perform repeat biopsy in itself is not associated with a greater risk of serious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/186\" class=\"abstract_t\">186</a>]. The need for hospitalization was primarily due to infectious complications. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p>A higher rate of complications has been reported for transperineal biopsy. In a study that included 3000 patients, the overall rate of complications following a free-hand transperineal biopsy guided by transrectal ultrasound was 40 percent (hematuria, hemospermia, urinary tract infection), but only 1.2 percent of patients required admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/187\" class=\"abstract_t\">187</a>]. As with transrectal biopsy, complications were directly correlated with the number of needle cores at 31.5 percent for 12 cores, 41.8 percent for 18 cores, and 57.4 percent for more than 24 cores. In a separate study using a template-guided method in 87 patients, the overall rate of complications was similar at 42.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/188\" class=\"abstract_t\">188</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor urinary or rectal bleeding is to be expected after prostate biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/189,190\" class=\"abstract_t\">189,190</a>]. Bleeding is generally self-limited and requires no intervention. Blood streaks on the ultrasound probe are noted in 17 to 27 percent of patients undergoing the procedure. Visible hematuria following biopsy is common with reported rates ranging from 10 to 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/190\" class=\"abstract_t\">190</a>]. In a retrospective review of 5802 transurethral ultrasound-guided sextant biopsies, hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematospermia occurred in approximately 50 percent of patients and lasted more than three days in 23 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/191\" class=\"abstract_t\">191</a>]. The risk of rectal bleeding increases with an increasing numbers of sample cores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/142,190,192\" class=\"abstract_t\">142,190,192</a>], but severe rectal bleeding requiring intervention occurs in less than 1 percent of procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/190,193\" class=\"abstract_t\">190,193</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of rectal hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the hemodynamically stable patient who is experiencing brisk rectal bleeding, manual digital compression of the prostate is the first line strategy; rectal packing with gauze can also be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/194\" class=\"abstract_t\">194</a>]. As direct pressure is being applied, the patient's vital signs are monitored and coagulation parameters checked and corrected, as needed. In the event that bleeding continues or the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, consultation for endoscopic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection, Endoclip&trade;) or surgical (ie, ligation) intervention should be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/194,195\" class=\"abstract_t\">194,195</a>].</p><p>A randomized trial of 275 patients evaluated the efficacy of placement of a rectal Foley catheter inflated to 50 mL in an attempt to prevent rectal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/196\" class=\"abstract_t\">196</a>]. Placement of the catheter was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of any amount of rectal bleeding compared to controls (1.5 versus 17.7 percent). We do not advocate the routine use of this technique for prevention, since it may cause undue discomfort for a marginal benefit. However, it may be useful for temporary control of significant rectal bleeding while awaiting consultation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary tract infection is the most common infectious complication of prostate biopsy, occurring in 1 to 11 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/70,94,103,190,197,198\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,94,103,190,197,198</a>]. A multinational, prospective study found a high rate of symptomatic urinary tract infections (5.2 percent) but lower rate of hospitalization (3.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. No statistically significant differences were found comparing the infection rate in Africa, Asia, or Europe. </p><p>Antibiotic prophylaxis before biopsy decreases the rate of urinary tract infection, but some patients are at risk for serious infectious complications independent of prophylaxis. In an observational study of 2023 patients who received antibiotics prior to prostate biopsy, 3 percent became septic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/199\" class=\"abstract_t\">199</a>]. Predictive risk factors for sepsis included presence of an indwelling urethral catheter, diabetes mellitus, or biopsy with more than ten cores. In other reviews, these factors and others including hospitalization in the month prior to biopsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a history of recent antibiotic usage or international travel, were identified as increasing the risk for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/200,201\" class=\"abstract_t\">200,201</a>].</p><p>Treatment of urinary infection following prostate biopsy with oral antibiotics (eg, fluoroquinolone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>) is generally sufficient, though hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/77,192\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,192</a>]. Antibiotic treatment may be altered based upon the clinical response and the results of urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in men&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Acute postbiopsy prostatitis is a relatively uncommon, but potentially life-threatening complication that warrants immediate evaluation and intervention. Prior fluoroquinolone use and extended post-biopsy antibiotic regimens appear to increase the risk for post-biopsy prostatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/92,202,203\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,202,203</a>]. Issues related to acute prostatitis are presented separately.

Alpha-blocker therapy can be initiated for patients with residual urine volumes of less than 100 mL, while insertion of a small-caliber (12 to 16 Fr) urethral catheter (or suprapubic catheter) is warranted in patients with higher residual volumes. The patient should also be placed on stool softeners to ease mechanical strain on the prostate during bowel movements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-urinary-retention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute urinary retention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1240755\"><span class=\"h2\">Rare tumor seeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common patient concern is the possibility of spreading cancer cells with prostate. Although isolated cases of tumor seeding the needle tract have been reported, these are rare and more often associated with the transperineal compared with a transrectal approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-biopsy/abstract/204,205\" class=\"abstract_t\">204,205</a>]. The very low risk of tumor seeding should not preclude an indicated biopsy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostate biopsy is a safe and effective sampling technique in which tissue is obtained in a minimally-invasive fashion from the prostate gland for the purpose of detecting cancer. Prostate biopsy is performed on patients with abnormal prostate specific antigen levels or abnormal digital rectal examination. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy is the preferred approach for most patients. This procedure is usually performed in an office setting with local anesthesia. Other approaches, including transperineal prostate biopsy, are used under special circumstances with ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) may occasionally be used to obtain a tissue specimen. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend antibiotic prophylaxis prior to prostate biopsy with a single dose of a fluoroquinolone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). With antibiotic prophylaxis, the rate of serious infectious complications (eg, urosepsis) is low. Cleansing enemas are unnecessary provided patients have received appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic antibiotics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Rectal cleansing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For first-time prostate biopsy, we suggest extended-core biopsy rather than sextant biopsy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Extended core biopsy as a means to sample the prostate increases the detection of prostate pathology; however, it remains unclear whether the benefits of increased detection outweigh the risks for over diagnosis and subsequent treatment complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer#H42\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a small prostate volume, a smaller number of core samples may be appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Sampling methods'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2924776\" class=\"local\">'Need for repeat biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a histologic diagnosis of atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP), we suggest repeat biopsy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The need to perform repeat biopsy in patients with other premalignant pathology is individualized. A larger number of core samples should be obtained during repeat biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H2924776\" class=\"local\">'Need for repeat biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minor urinary or rectal bleeding is common after prostate biopsy, is generally self-limited and only on rare occasion requires some form of intervention. The risk of rectal bleeding increases with an increasing numbers of sample cores. The continued use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in the periprocedural period has not been associated with an increased risk of clinically significant hemorrhage.
