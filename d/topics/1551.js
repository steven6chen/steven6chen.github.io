Exposure to ultraviolet light most likely contributes to the development of AFX. </p><p>The relationship between AFX, pleomorphic dermal sarcoma, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), a soft tissue neoplasm that shares many histologic features with AFX, is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. While some authors consider AFX a less aggressive, superficial variant of pleomorphic dermal sarcoma and UPS, many others view AFX as a distinct malignancy. </p><p>The recommended treatment for AFX is surgical removal of the entire tumor with Mohs surgery or wide local excision. AFX generally has a good prognosis. Metastasis is a rare event. </p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of AFX are discussed here. Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma is reviewed separately.

The results of a retrospective study of surgical logs for Mohs surgery (a common treatment for AFX) from five practices in Texas offers support for the infrequent occurrence of this tumor. Out of 42,279 skin cancers treated with Mohs surgery, only 105 (0.2 percent) were AFX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>AFX most commonly occurs in older adults (usually seventh or eighth decade of life) and has a predilection for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Consistent with these assertions, a retrospective study of 91 patients with AFX found an average age of diagnosis of 72 years and 75 patients (82 percent) were men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a German study of 53 patients, the mean age was 80 years (range 52 to 99 years) and 45 (85 percent) were men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Although AFX may occur in individuals of any racial background, most reported cases have occurred in non-Hispanic white individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. A personal history of prior basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma is common in patients with AFX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172378600\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms that lead to the development of atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) are not well-understood. Ultraviolet light exposure has been proposed as a major contributing factor based upon several observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AFX most frequently occurs on sun-exposed skin of the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/5,6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,8,9</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar to nonmelanoma skin cancers promoted by ultraviolet light exposure, AFX is most common in older individuals, men, and the non-Hispanic white population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/5,6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,8,9</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>P53 mutations and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (UV photoproducts involved in skin cancer development) have been detected in AFX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with xeroderma pigmentosum have developed AFX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]</p><p/><p>Additional factors, including radiation therapy, immunosuppression, burns, and trauma have been proposed as contributors to AFX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/6,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15-17</a>]. However, there are few data to support these theories, resulting in uncertainty about the role of these factors in tumor development. </p><p>A potential role for radiation therapy was supported by a retrospective study of 140 patients with AFX in which at least six patients (4 percent) had a history of radiation treatment at the site of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The detection of AFX in 1 of 642 renal transplant recipients followed during a two year period at a Swiss university hospital (equivalent to an estimated risk for AFX of <span class=\"nowrap\">78/100,000</span> persons per year) suggested that the risk for AFX may be increased in immunosuppressed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, more data on the risk for AFX are necessary to confirm whether the risk exceeds the risk for the general population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172378879\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The origin of tumor cells in atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) has been debated. Immunohistochemical analyses suggest that AFX most likely originates from myofibroblasts or fibroblast-like cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6569835\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) usually presents as a solitary, pink or red, firm, papule or nodule that grows over the course of several months and may ulcerate or bleed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62531%7EDERM%2F89515\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62531 graphicRef89515 \">picture 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/1,6,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,19</a>]. Tumors are usually less than 2 cm in diameter, but occasionally reach several centimeters or more in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A rare pigmented variant of AFX has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>The head and neck are the most common sites for AFX. Truncal and extremity tumors are less common and may present as larger tumors. Rarely sites such as the eyelid or cornea are affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>Most AFX tumors are asymptomatic. Tenderness occurs in a minority. Pruritus is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6569849\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common histopathologic findings of atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89535%7EDERM%2F89516\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89535 graphicRef89516 \">picture 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Well-circumscribed, nonencapsulated dermal tumor that is contiguous with the epidermis or separated from epidermis by narrow zone of collagen (Grenz zone)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cellular proliferation of plump spindle cells with prominent nuclei, epithelioid cells, and multinucleated giant cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical mitoses and severe cellular pleomorphism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variable presence of thin or ulcerated epidermis, or peripheral epidermal collarette</p><p/><p>In addition to the classic features listed above, several histologic subtypes of AFX have been described in the literature.

A skin biopsy and immunohistochemical studies are required to confirm the diagnosis. AFX is a diagnosis of exclusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172378925\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An excisional biopsy is the preferred biopsy procedure for AFX. This procedure provides a large tissue sample that allows for visualization of the tumor architecture, which can help to differentiate AFX from undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), a tumor with a less favorable prognosis, but similar histologic features. However, because clinical suspicion for AFX is often low, a shave biopsy is sometimes the initial diagnostic procedure. The pathologic finding of a tumor composed of spindle cells and epithelioid cells that exhibits marked nuclear pleomorphism raises suspicion for a diagnosis of AFX. (See <a href=\"#H6569849\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;, section on 'Excision'</a> and <a href=\"#H259579315\" class=\"local\">'Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259579674\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunohistochemistry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunohistochemistry is a valuable tool for differentiating AFX from other spindle cell tumors with similar clinical and histologic findings, including spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma and desmoplastic melanoma. The key immunohistochemical stains employed to distinguish AFX from these tumors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytokeratin</strong> (negative in AFX, positive in spindle cell cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>S100</strong> (negative in AFX, positive in desmoplastic melanoma)</p><p/><p>Depending on the histologic differential, additional stains may aid with diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/1,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28-31</a>]. CD10, actin, and vimentin are often positive in AFX, though these stains are not exclusive to this tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/4,8,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,32,33</a>]. Rarely, melanocyte stains, such as microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), can be positive in AFX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma stains positively for the transcription factor p63; however, the p63 stain is negative in AFX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. P40 has been shown to be equally sensitive and more specific than p63 for the differentiation of spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma from AFX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172378965\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A report of the dermoscopic findings of three AFX tumors led to the identification of white areas and an atypical polymorphous vascular pattern characterized by linear, dotted, hairpin, arborescent, and highly tortuous vessels as dermoscopic features of AFX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These findings are not specific to AFX.

UPS is a soft tissue sarcoma that lacks an identifiable line of differentiation. </p><p>The replacement of the term UPS for MFH arose after it was recognized that with more extensive testing, many tumors previously identified as MFH could be classified as other tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Because of the pathologic similarities between AFX and UPS, some authors have questioned whether AFX represents a superficial, less aggressive variant of UPS, rather than a distinct tumor. </p><p>Several histologic characteristics have been proposed as features that may help to differentiate AFX and UPS in the clinical setting. Features that may favor a diagnosis of UPS over a diagnosis of AFX include involvement of the deep subcutis, penetration of fascia or muscle, necrosis, and vascular invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>A few studies have identified additional findings that suggest a valid distinction between AFX and UPS. In a study of seven AFX tumors and four tumors identified as MFH, the score for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (UV photoproducts that appear to play an important role in skin cancer development) was significantly greater in AFX than in MFH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, p53 mutations were more commonly detected in AFX (4 of 6 versus 1 of 4). Small studies have also reported genetic differences between AFX and <span class=\"nowrap\">UPS/MFH</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259579367\"><span class=\"h2\">Other disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disorders that may clinically resemble AFX include basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, amelanotic melanoma, pyogenic granuloma, and adnexal tumors. The rare pigmented form of AFX may be clinically mistaken for pigmented melanoma or pigmented basal cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>The histologic differential diagnosis for AFX includes other dermal tumors that contain spindle cells. Examples include spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma, desmoplastic melanoma, and leiomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemical studies are useful for distinguishing AFX from these disorders. (See <a href=\"#H259579674\" class=\"local\">'Immunohistochemistry'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348129416\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients diagnosed with atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) should receive a full skin examination that includes inspection of the tumor site to estimate the clinical extent of the tumor and palpation of the regional lymph nodes. The skin examination also serves to detect the presence of other cutaneous malignancies. </p><p>Radiologic imaging is not necessary for the evaluation of most patients with AFX. When the clinical examination suggests the possibility of extensive tissue invasion (large [eg, &ge;2 cm diameter], infiltrative [bound-down], or poorly-defined tumors), radiologic imaging can be useful for estimating the extent and depth of tumor invasion. Radiologic imaging of distant body sites is not indicated in the absence of signs or symptoms that suggest distant disease. (See <a href=\"#H6569870\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6569863\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the potential for metastatic spread of atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX), treatment of these tumors is recommended (see <a href=\"#H6569870\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below). Complete surgical removal with Mohs surgery or wide local excision is the recommended method of treatment. </p><p>Mohs surgery is a staged, tissue-sparing surgical procedure in which cutaneous tumors are removed in a manner that allows the surgeon to evaluate 100 percent of the excisional margin intraoperatively through the use of frozen sections. The narrow surgical margins taken during each stage of the procedure allows the surgeon to take the minimal margin of healthy tissue necessary for tumor removal. In patients with AFX, the procedure is facilitated by the marked cellular pleomorphism characteristic of AFX. This feature makes the identification of tumor cells on frozen tissue sections relatively easy. No high quality trials have compared the efficacy of Mohs surgery and wide local excision, leading to uncertainty about the comparative efficacy of these procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mohs-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mohs surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259580152\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although we consider both Mohs surgery and wide local excision to be acceptable options for the treatment of AFX, we prefer Mohs surgery as our treatment of choice for AFX on the head and neck because of the tissue-sparing effects of the procedure. The 2 cm margin suggested for wide local excision of AFX is often difficult to achieve in these areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Tumors located in other sites in which securing a 2 cm margin is difficult (eg, lower leg) can also benefit from the Mohs surgery procedure. (See <a href=\"#H4341968\" class=\"local\">'Mohs surgery'</a> below and <a href=\"#H172378998\" class=\"local\">'Wide local excision'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4341968\"><span class=\"h3\">Mohs surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of Mohs surgery for AFX is supported by several retrospective studies that have identified a low risk for tumor recurrence after this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/5,7,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,43,44</a>]. In the largest retrospective study of AFX tumors managed with Mohs surgery, among 58 tumors treated with Mohs surgery and followed for a median of 4.5 years (range 1 to 16.1 years), no recurrences were reported. In contrast, the possibility of treatment failure after Mohs surgery was illustrated in a retrospective study of 29 patients treated with Mohs surgery for AFX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Patients in this study were followed for a mean of 3.3 years (range 44 to 3818 days) and the recurrence rate after Mohs surgery was 7 percent. </p><p>Disadvantages of Mohs surgery compared with wide local excision include the longer duration of the procedure, higher cost, and the lower availability of the procedure. Mohs surgery requires a surgeon specifically trained in the procedure and specialized equipment for tissue examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mohs-surgery#H9314583\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mohs surgery&quot;, section on 'Surgical technique'</a>.)</p><p>A modification to Mohs surgery, staged excision with circumferential margin assessment (&ldquo;slow Mohs&rdquo;), in which formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tangential sections are examined to determine circumferential tumor-free margins prior to wound closure has also been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The efficacy of this procedure for AFX has not been compared to standard Mohs surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172378998\"><span class=\"h3\">Wide local excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although wide local excision can successfully treat AFX, only a small portion of the tumor margin is examined during pathologic examination. Tumors may recur if the margin used to excise the tumor is inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/5,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,44</a>]. </p><p>Data on the efficacy of wide local excision for the management of AFX are limited. Reported tumor recurrence rates following wide local excision typically have ranged between 0 and 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, in many reports of AFX treated with wide local excision, surgical margins have not been specified. Thus, the likelihood of successful treatment with any specific surgical excision marker is unclear. </p><p>Surgical margins of 2 cm are suggested based upon a retrospective study that found that in 59 tumors treated with Mohs surgery, margins of 2 cm or less cleared 97 percent of tumors. Due to the frequent location of AFX on the head and neck, such margins are often not feasible. Postoperative margin assessment by a pathologist should be performed after all AFX excisions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348129292\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy is an additional option for treatment of AFX that is typically reserved for adjuvant treatment of tumors that cannot be excised with clear surgical margins. Occasionally, radiation therapy is given as the primary mode of treatment for patients who are not candidates for surgery. (See <a href=\"#H4342028\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent tumors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4342007\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunosuppressed patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mohs surgery is our preferred method of treatment for AFX in immunosuppressed patients. In a retrospective study of 12 AFX tumors that occurred in solid organ transplant recipients, none of the six tumors initially treated with Mohs surgery recurred or metastasized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In contrast, three of five tumors removed with surgical excision recurred, including one that also metastasized. Of note, the surgical margins for the wide local excisions were not specified. If wide local excision is performed, we suggest excising the tumor with 2 cm margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4342028\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines for the management of recurrent tumors are lacking. We typically manage recurrent AFX tumors with Mohs surgery. If wide local excision is performed, we excise these tumors with 2 cm margins whenever feasible. Adjuvant radiation therapy is administered if complete excision of the recurrent tumor is not possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6569870\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) has a good prognosis. Recurrences usually develop within three years after excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Metastasis is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. The lymph nodes are often the initial site of metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a series of 53 patients with AFX treated with Mohs surgery, the relapse-free survival at 12 months was 91 percent; five patients had a relapse within two years and four developed metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a review of approximately 1500 published cases for which information on outcome was available, the overall recurrence rate was 7.6 percent; among 451 patients for whom complete follow-up data were available, the disease-specific survival was 98 percent at 5, 10, and 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Immunosuppressed patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma have a less favorable prognosis for this tumor than immunocompetent patients. There is concern that immunosuppressed patients with AFX also may have an increased risk for aggressive tumor behavior based upon a small retrospective study of published and unpublished cases that documented three tumor recurrences and one metastasis in 12 solid organ transplant recipients with AFX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Additional studies are necessary to confirm an increase in risk for aggressive tumor behavior in this population.</p><p>Involvement of the subcutis portends a worse prognosis and should prompt concern for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. However, rare cases of metastases and death have been reported with little or no subcutaneous involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Some authors have proposed labeling these more aggressive, superficial lesions as dermal pleomorphic sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348129402\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no standard guidelines for the follow-up regimen for patients with atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX). We perform a full skin examination every six months to check for tumor recurrence and additional cutaneous malignancies. We also palpate regional lymph nodes to evaluate for evidence of metastatic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348129619\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) is an uncommon cutaneous tumor that is most likely to occur on sun-damaged skin in elderly men. Ultraviolet light exposure is theorized to be a major risk factor for the development of AFX. (See <a href=\"#H6569821\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H172378600\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AFX usually presents as a solitary pink or red nodule. Tumors are often less than 2 cm in diameter, but may be larger. The head and neck are the most common sites for tumor development. (See <a href=\"#H6569835\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic pathologic findings of AFX are a dermal tumor composed of spindle cells, epithelioid cells, and multinucleated giant cells. Cellular pleomorphism is a prominent feature. (See <a href=\"#H6569849\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AFX is a diagnosis of exclusion. A skin biopsy and immunohistochemical studies are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry is particularly useful for differentiating AFX from other spindle cell tumors that may present with similar clinical and pathologic features, such as spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma and desmoplastic melanoma. (See <a href=\"#H4341939\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete surgical excision with Mohs surgery or wide local excision with a 2 cm margin is the treatment of choice for AFX. Because Mohs surgery is a tissue-sparing technique, we suggest treatment with Mohs surgery over wide local excision for AFX on the head, neck, or other sites in which conservation of healthy tissue is a high priority (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis for AFX is usually good. Tumors may recur if surgical margins are inadequate. Metastasis is rare. (See <a href=\"#H6569870\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-fibroxanthoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ziemer M.
