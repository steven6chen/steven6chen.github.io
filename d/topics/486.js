Clinical symptoms (infections) are generally first noted between 3 and 18 months of age.</p><p>XLA is due to defects in a signal transduction molecule called Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Patients who present because of clinical symptoms are usually initially identified by significant <span class=\"nowrap\">hypogammaglobulinemia/agammaglobulinemia</span> and the near absence of CD19+ B cells. The diagnosis is then confirmed with molecular studies identifying a mutation in the <em>BTK</em> gene.

However, results from a United States registry of patients with XLA provided a minimal estimate of approximately 1 in 379,000 live births (1 in 190,000 male births) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>XLA is caused by mutations in the <em>BTK</em> gene, named in honor of the clinician who described the first case in 1952, located on the long arm of the X chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/1-5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5,7</a>]. Approximately 40 percent of patients with XLA are born into a family with a previously affected family member [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This reiterates the importance of suspecting the diagnosis in patients with a phenotype consistent with XLA since approximately 60 percent of patients have a spontaneous mutation.</p><p>Btk is a member of the Tec family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, which are signal transduction molecules. Btk is expressed in all stages of B cell lineage development, as well as in myeloid and erythroid cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-humoral-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The humoral immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Impairment is also seen in T cell memory responses to mucosal-colonizing bacteria (eg, <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>) but not to obligate respiratory pathogens (eg, influenza virus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The T cell repertoire is altered compared with that of normal individuals, showing restricted diversity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients present with recurrent infection, although some are identified at an earlier stage due to a positive family history. Unfortunately, two-thirds of patients even with a positive family history are NOT diagnosed at or soon after birth but rather are diagnosed after they have presented with clinical symptoms. Nevertheless, the presence of a positive family history does influence the average age of diagnosis. It is 2.6 years in boys with a positive family history and 5.4 years in boys with a negative family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The term newborn with XLA is protected by maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) that is actively transported across the placenta during the last trimester of pregnancy. Hypogammaglobulinemia and an increased susceptibility to infection develop as the maternally acquired IgG is catabolized after birth and the infant is unable to make <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> own (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73913\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73913 \">figure 1</a>). Thus, patients generally do not present with clinical symptoms until after three months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Nearly 50 percent of patients develop clinical manifestations by one year of age, and well over 95 percent develop symptoms by five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of patients are diagnosed by two years of age. There are rare reports of individual patients with well-documented XLA who did not have sufficient clinical symptoms to be diagnosed with agammaglobulinemia until well into adult life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H712509040\"><span class=\"h3\">When to suspect XLA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major problem for the clinician is when to suspect X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) or any other primary immunodeficiency. The disorder is relatively uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], but many of the clinical manifestations of the disease, such as infections, are relatively common in the general population.</p><p>It is important to obtain a detailed family history in any patient since a substantial minority of patients (41 percent) has had an affected family member [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is critical to ask specifically if there have been previous relatives who were hospitalized as children, had significant illnesses as children, or died as children as these are important clues to the presence of significant inherited disorders. In patients with a positive family history, one may be able to make the diagnosis before the patient has had any infections.</p><p>The majority of patients with XLA, however, do not have a positive family history, and this is where the clinical skills of the clinician are critically important. There is no easy formula for the number of infections that should prompt a suspicion of a primary immunodeficiency. However, there are clinical settings in which the diagnosis should be considered. Chief among these are when the clinician suspects that the patient has an increased susceptibility to infection as defined by recurrent infections (ie, otitis media), unusually severe infections such as pneumonia requiring hospitalization, or infections that are atypical in their presentation or their causative organism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with recurrent infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is only one characteristic physical finding of XLA and that is the absence or near absence of the B cell-rich tonsils and adenoids. Palpable lymphoid tissue is absent in some patients. However, peripheral lymph nodes can appear normal because of hypertrophy of the T cells areas. Recurrent bacterial respiratory tract infections are the most common manifestation of XLA.</p><p>Clinical signs and symptoms of recurrent and chronic sinopulmonary infections and their sequelae include chronic cough, chronic rhinitis and postnasal drainage, and digital clubbing.

The infections are usually caused by encapsulated pyogenic bacteria, organisms for which opsonization by antibody is a primary host defense.</p><p>Several bacterial species account for the majority of episodes of sepsis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and central nervous system (CNS) infections in patients with XLA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type B</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Pseudomonas </em>species</p><p/><p>The specific infectious etiology of lower respiratory tract infections is usually unknown.

In a report of 254 children with community-acquired pneumonia who were screened for immunodeficiency, 2 of 132 males in the series were found to have XLA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. After diagnosis, pneumonia and acute and chronic sinusitis are the most common of the respiratory tract infections, even after replacement therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Bronchitis and pneumonia are of special significance since they can lead to chronic lung disease (bronchiectasis and airflow obstruction) and pulmonary insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/6,10,11,13,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,11,13,23-25</a>]. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest, along with pulmonary function testing in children old enough to complete the study, should be performed as part of the initial evaluation to ascertain the <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/extent</span> of bronchiectasis and to assess pulmonary functional status.

In fact, the first patient described presented with recurrent episodes of sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Systemic bloodborne bacterial infections have become less frequent with the advent of adequate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy, although these infections still occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Intravascular/lymphatic</span> infection caused by organisms of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Flexispiral/Helicobacter</span> family has been described in XLA patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. These infections are bloodborne and usually persistent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent. A clue to their diagnosis is the presence of characteristic brawny, indurated, violaceous cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions on the extremities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Viral, fungal, and parasitic infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with XLA are also more susceptible to certain viral, fungal, and parasitic infections.</p><p>Chronic and unremitting systemic infections with enteroviruses such as ECHOvirus and coxsackievirus can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

However, they still occur in some isolated cases, even in the face of adequate levels of IgG with replacement therapy. Enteroviral infections can take the form of chronic meningoencephalitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic hepatitis, or they may masquerade as dermatomyositis with direct infection of muscle and skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].

Unfortunately, none have provided reliable and consistent long-term improvement, although there are cases where each appeared to have some benefit. New enteroviral medications under study show promise in the treatment of life-threatening enteroviral infections in primary immunodeficiency diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Other, less common viral, fungal, and parasitic infections also occur. Lower respiratory infections caused by <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii </em>(formerly <em>P. carinii</em>) are usually only seen in patients who are debilitated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">Mycoplasma/ureaplasma</span> cause some cases of arthritis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> osteomyelitis, most often in patients receiving inadequate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy. Other examples include chronic rotavirus gastroenteritis, described in isolated cases, and <em>Giardia lamblia</em> gastrointestinal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/1-3,6,11,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,6,11,36</a>].</p><p>Patients with XLA are also prone to develop vaccine-related polio after receiving the live-attenuated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">poliovirus vaccine</a> directly or, less commonly, after close contact with an individual who received the live-attenuated vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/6,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,37</a>]. Vaccine-related poliomyelitis is characterized by a relatively long incubation period, a chronic encephalomyelitis, and a high mortality rate.

These include lymphoreticular malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/6,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,38</a>], gastric and colorectal adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>], and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

In another report, adenomatous polyps were found at a relatively young age in two of four patients with XLA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A single patient with XLA and precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was also reported. Due to the mild mutation in BTK in this patient, however, it is not possible to conclude that the lack of BTK led to an increased risk of ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agammaglobulinemia/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. The risk of malignancy is therefore uncertain, given the conflicting data in these reports.
