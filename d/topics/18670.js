In addition, wheezing with viral illnesses, particularly with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV), in infants and young children is associated with an increased risk of developing childhood asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms by which viral respiratory infections trigger wheezing and asthma exacerbations are reviewed here. The influence of viral infection on both the development and perpetuation of asthma is also discussed. Other issues relating to the pathogenesis of asthma are reviewed elsewhere. Treatment of virus-induced wheezing and asthma is also discussed separately.

Respiratory symptoms with viral infections most likely result from virus-induced damage of the airway epithelium, followed by airway inflammation in a predisposed individual. Immune responses triggered by viral respiratory tract infections include enhanced allergic inflammation, increased granulocyte recruitment, promotion of cytokine production, and upregulation of the parasympathetic response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75402 \">table 1</a>). These proinflammatory responses further influence the host responses to other microbial infections, allergens, stress, and pollutants.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epithelial cells</strong> &ndash; Respiratory epithelial cells are the initial site of viral inoculation and serve as the primary site of viral replication. Respiratory viruses, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cause cytopathic damage to airway epithelium, and these changes can affect the function of the epithelium and airway smooth muscle. In addition, disturbing the integrity of the epithelial layer may enhance mucosal permeability and increase exposure of inflammatory and antigen-presenting cells to allergens, other infections, and irritants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Approximately 90 percent of rhinovirus human rhinovirus-A (HRV-A) and human rhinovirus-B (HRV-B) serotypes bind to respiratory epithelial cells via the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1, also called CD54 [cluster of differentiation 54]), while a minority, belonging to the HRV-A group, bind to the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. CDHR3, a human cadherin-related family member 3 protein, mediates human rhinovirus-C (HRV-C) entry into host cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The receptor for HRV-C strains has not yet been identified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rhinoviruses, in contrast to other respiratory viruses, do not damage the epithelium. However, rhinovirus and other respiratory viruses can activate epithelial cells to upregulate the expression of ICAM-1 receptors, enhancing replication of HRV. They also induce epithelial cells to secrete a wide variety of chemokines and cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8 (also called CXCL8 [chemokine, C-X-C motif, ligand 8]), IL-11, and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normally T expressed, and presumably secreted; also called CCL5 [chemokine, C-C motif, ligand 5]), a chemoattractant for eosinophils, monocytes, and T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-21</a>]. In addition, viral infections may also induce the release of epithelial mediators such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-25, and IL-33, which promote T helper cell type 2 (Th2) inflammation, particularly in patients with atopy and asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many of these mediators have been identified in experimental or natural infections and can affect cell recruitment, cell activation, and the overall inflammatory response. Furthermore, in vitro work showing upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and costimulatory molecules, B-lymphocyte activation antigens B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86), in pulmonary epithelial cells after rhinovirus infection suggests that epithelial cells may play a role in antigen presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dendritic cells</strong> &ndash; Several investigations have implicated airway mucosa dendritic cells as potent antigen presenting cells and mediators of the synergistic inflammation induced by the presence of atopy and viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Specifically, upregulation and crosslinking of the FcEpsilon receptor on lung dendritic cells may promote Th2 inflammation and modulate type I interferon antiviral responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Airway inflammation</strong> &ndash; Respiratory viral infection and replication activate innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses, resulting in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the airway. Rhinovirus has shown few cytopathic effects on airway epithelium or other tissues in contrast to other respiratory viruses, such as RSV and influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. These observations raise the possibility that rhinovirus can induce and promote airway inflammation by its interaction with airway cells and the subsequent stimulation of cytokine production.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rhinovirus infection was experimentally induced in a number of studies, and the subsequent response to antigen challenge was evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/30-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-35</a>]. Experimental infections with rhinovirus lead to increased airway responsiveness, enhanced inflammatory responses, a higher likelihood for the development of the late-allergic reaction, and eosinophil recruitment to the airway following antigen challenge. The histologic changes seen with experimental infection are also seen in biopsies from individuals with naturally occurring rhinovirus colds. Collectively, these studies support the view that rhinovirus promotes lower airway inflammation to allergen and can thereby enhance existing allergic inflammation. The following studies are illustrative:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Two studies found increased airway responsiveness to histamine and augmentation of both the immediate- and late-phase responses to inhaled allergen following experimental rhinovirus infection in patients with allergic rhinitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79253\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79253 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In one of these reports, rhinovirus infection enhanced the allergic inflammatory reaction in the lower airway, as demonstrated by increased recruitment of eosinophils to the airway following segmental antigen challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased submucosal lymphocytes and epithelial eosinophils are demonstrated on biopsy of the lower airway during rhinovirus colds that are associated with increased airway responsiveness to histamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The increase in mucosal eosinophils persists well into the convalescent period in subjects with asthma. In another study, nasal lavage eosinophil counts prior to experimental rhinovirus infection were inversely correlated with the severity and duration of subsequent cold symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Studies have also shown that rhinovirus replicates equally well in the upper and lower airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In these studies, bronchial epithelial cells from patients with asthma show markedly increased rhinovirus replication compared with those without asthma. In addition, rhinovirus can enter the lower airway and stimulate <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages</span> and lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This interaction can lead to the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the airway and generation of proinflammatory and antiviral mediators.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Granulocytes</strong> &ndash; Neutrophils are the principal cells recruited to the airways during the acute phase of a viral infection and are also recruited to the lower airways during experimental rhinovirus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. During acute viral illness, HRV-infected adults with asthma have increased recruitment of neutrophils compared with HRV-infected adults without asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This response is, in part, regulated by IL-8 (CXCL8) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/15,38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,38-42</a>]. There is evidence that the recruited cells are activated. Levels of airway granulocyte enzymes (eg, myeloperoxidase) increase in parallel with the recruitment of neutrophils. The mechanism by which these cells are activated during the viral illness is not well understood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The interrelationship between eosinophils and viral infections is less well defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. There is little evidence from in vitro studies that rhinoviruses activate eosinophils, in contrast to in vivo observations. Eosinophils are increased in the bronchial epithelium in biopsies of both patients with asthma and controls during acute rhinovirus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Increased levels of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) are seen in nasal secretions of children with wheezing during RSV infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This finding suggests that eosinophil recruitment to the airway and activation events may be directly related to RSV actions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Macrophages and monocytes</strong> &ndash; Airway macrophages are the predominant airway cell and are probably involved in host responses to respiratory viruses. Nasal secretions obtained during upper respiratory tract infections contain IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/39,40,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40,47,48</a>]. A similar cytokine pattern is seen when macrophages are incubated with respiratory viruses in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/15,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,49-51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These cytokines are important in the development of acute symptoms, such as fever and myalgia. In addition, these mediators can stimulate epithelial cells to express adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. This upregulation of adhesion molecule expression can have a dual effect of increasing both receptor binding sites for rhinovirus and ligands for inflammatory cells. The end result is an increase in the inflammatory response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphocytes</strong> &ndash; Respiratory viruses can provoke specific and nonspecific responses in T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Natural killer cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells all participate in antiviral immune responses. As an example, CD8+ cells are a major source of TNF-alpha, which is important for antiviral effects, but can also stimulate epithelial cells to express ICAM-1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Virus-specific T-cell responses are not detected in the airway or blood until 7 to 10 days following inoculation. The timing of this response raises questions about the role of virus-specific T cells in acute wheezing episodes. In contrast, lung T cells are probably activated in an antigen or virus-independent manner through &quot;bystander&quot; effects. As an example, incubation of peripheral blood monocytes with rhinovirus leads to increased expression of the early activation marker, CD69, on approximately 50 percent of T cells. Associated with this response is an increase in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In mice, antigen-independent activation of T cells occurs during systemic viral infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, a viral surrogate that is used instead of RSV or HRV. Other examples exist and suggest that respiratory viruses can cause nonspecific T-cell recruitment and activation early in the course of a viral infection. The timing of this response suggests that it could serve to enhance existing airway inflammation and consequently exacerbate underlying asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytokine release</strong> &ndash; Viruses most likely enhance allergic inflammation and promote asthma exacerbations through the release of proinflammatory cytokines. A number of investigators have found increased concentrations of cytokines, including IL-1, IL-2, IFN-alpha, and IFN-gamma, in nasal aspirates and from activated peripheral blood cells at the time of a cold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/47,55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,55-58</a>]. These observations raise the possibility that rhinovirus either stimulates cytokine production, thereby changing the microenvironment of the lower airway, or enhances the capacity of cells to generate cytokines in response to other stimuli. The end result of this effect on cytokine production is an increased potential for allergic inflammation during an encounter with other factors, such as allergens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Virus-induced wheezing is also linked to deficiencies in antiviral innate immunity, specifically IFN production in response to viral infection. The interferons may play several roles in asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Type I interferons (IFN-alpha, IFN-beta) are important in antiviral immunity, and patients with asthma have decreased virus-induced IFN-beta compared with those without asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Furthermore, an inverse correlation was found between peak cold symptoms and the IFN-gamma to IL-5 mRNA ratio in atopic subjects with experimental rhinovirus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. The mechanisms for decreased IFN-production are not known, but may be related to deficient expression of Toll-like receptors, such as TLR3 and <span class=\"nowrap\">TLR7/8,</span> or in molecules involved in signaling cascades.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Abnormalities in IFN-lambda production are described in patients with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In vitro research has shown that baseline IFN-lambda<sub>1-3</sub> production is deficient in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages in patients with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. A prospective study in school-aged children with asthma reported increased IFN-lambda<sub>1</sub> production in acutely HRV-infected wheezing children compared with HRV-infected nonwheezers, suggesting that IFN-lambda<sub>1</sub> production may modulate HRV-induced asthma exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Further research is needed to determine the definitive role of IFN-lambda in virus-induced wheezing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">TSLP is released in HRV- and RSV-infected human bronchial epithelial cells, resulting in increased dendritic and mast cell expression and a potent Th2 inflammatory cascade. These effects can potentially lead to airway hyperreactivity in response to viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Parasympathetic hyperresponsiveness</strong> &ndash; In animal studies, other mechanisms have been identified to explain changes in airway function during viral respiratory infections. Two studies in guinea pigs and rats found that viral respiratory infections impair inhibitory subtype 2 muscarinic receptor (M<sub>2</sub>) function, producing parasympathetic hyperresponsiveness that leads to bronchoconstriction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82258 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. This effect may persist for weeks after resolution of the acute infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Glucocorticoid administration reverses the virus-associated changes in airway function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased immunoglobulin E (IgE)</strong> &ndash; One study demonstrated increases in IgE levels in subjects with allergic rhinitis, but not in subjects with nonallergic rhinitis after experimental rhinovirus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Other investigators have shown that RSV and parainfluenza virus can stimulate total IgE and virus-specific IgE in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>].

Bronchiolitis, or inflammation of the bronchioles, is a clinical syndrome characterized by wheezing, tachypnea, and hyperinflation of the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

In fact, another study showed that wheezing with rhinovirus infection during the first three years of life was a much stronger risk factor for asthma at six years of age than wheezing with RSV infection or aeroallergen sensitization in a high-risk birth cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Individual host factors, such as genetic factors and atopy, most likely interact with viral factors in susceptible patients, resulting in an increased risk of developing asthma. Specifically, studies suggest that allergic sensitization in the first year of life is the initial event that interacts with viral infections, particularly rhinovirus, to promote the development of asthma in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/79,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,117</a>]. This interaction does not appear to be bidirectional, since wheezing with a viral illness did not increase the subsequent rate of allergic sensitization. However, it still remains unclear whether viral infections (HRV and RSV) play causative roles in the development of asthma or are markers of predisposed individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evidence suggests that genetic susceptibility may also play a role.

Strong interactions with respect to subsequent risk of asthma were demonstrated between 17q21 genotypes and rhinovirus-induced wheezing. In addition, mutations in the gene encoding cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) may be linked to increasing wheezing illnesses in children by mediating increased human rhinovirus-C (HRV-C) entry into host cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview/abstract/14,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,119</a>].
