It can cause hearing loss and balance problems. Another name for a vestibular schwannoma is &quot;acoustic neuroma.&quot;</p><p>Vestibular schwannomas are more common in adults than children. They usually happen in just 1 ear, but a few people get them in both ears.</p><p>Some people have a higher risk of getting a vestibular schwannoma. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have a disease called &quot;neurofibromatosis type 2&quot; or NF2 &ndash; This disease causes growths in different parts of the body. It can run in families. If someone in your family has NF2, you have a higher risk of getting a vestibular schwannoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who spend a lot of time around loud noise &ndash; This can happen at work or from loud music.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who had head and neck radiation treatment in childhood &ndash; This can cause a vestibular schwannoma many years later.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200537\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a vestibular schwannoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing loss &ndash; This can happen over many years. A person might not realize he or she does not hear as well as before.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tinnitus &ndash; This is when a person has ringing, buzzing, hissing, or roaring sounds in 1 or both ears.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balance problems when walking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A feeling of tilting to one side</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Face symptoms &ndash; These can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Numbness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trouble moving part of the face</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200552\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for vestibular schwannoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will do an exam and learn about your symptoms. He or she can order the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called an &quot;audiogram&quot; &ndash; In this test, you put on a headset. A hearing specialist (called an &quot;audiologist&quot;) plays sounds in 1 ear at a time. He or she asks you to signal when you hear the sounds. The test shows if you have hearing loss that could be from a vestibular schwannoma or another condition. It also shows whether both ears are affected the same way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests, such as MRI or CT scans &ndash; These tests create pictures of the inside of the body. They can show a vestibular schwannoma or other growth that is causing symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200567\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a vestibular schwannoma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Taking out the vestibular schwannoma can help you keep the hearing you still have. But if you already lost some hearing, surgery will not usually bring it back.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation &ndash; This treatment uses high doses of X-rays to keep the vestibular schwannoma from growing and causing more symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watchful waiting &ndash; This means you wait to see if your symptoms change, but don't have treatment right away. You get an imaging test every year. You will probably also have regular hearing tests. You might have surgery or radiation if the vestibular schwannoma starts growing quickly or starts causing symptoms.</p><p/><p>Doctors might recommend surgery or radiation if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are younger than many people with vestibular schwannoma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a large vestibular schwannoma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a lot of hearing loss because of the vestibular schwannoma &ndash; Without treatment, you could lose all your hearing. This is more likely if the vestibular schwannoma grows quickly.</p><p/><p>Doctors might recommend watchful waiting if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are older</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a small vestibular schwannoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have not lost much hearing yet</p><p/><p>A vestibular schwannoma can come back after surgery or radiation. If you have either of these treatments, you will probably have an MRI or CT every year for up to 10 years. These imaging tests can show if the vestibular schwannoma is coming back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200582\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-hearing-loss-presbycusis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertigo-a-type-of-dizziness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vertigo (a type of dizziness) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dizziness-and-vertigo-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dizziness and vertigo (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
