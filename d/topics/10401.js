Exercise can help prevent cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, and reduces the risk for some forms of cancer (eg, colon, breast, prostate). Other benefits of regular exercise for patients with T1DM include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory fitness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced muscle mass and strength</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced adiposity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased bone mineral density</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved insulin sensitivity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved cardiovascular risk profile</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved sense of well-being</p><p/><p>On average, adolescents with T1DM have reduced exercise capacity and display alterations in muscle and cardiac function compared with nondiabetic control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Unfortunately, like other youth with a chronic disease, children and adolescents with T1DM tend to be less active than their peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nonetheless, regular physical activity and exercise training are associated with improved cardiovascular autonomic regulation in adolescents with T1DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and with increased life expectancy in patients living with T1DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A clear beneficial effect of regular physical activity on overall metabolic control in adults with T1DM has not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>]. However, cross sectional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>] and interventional studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] in children and adolescents with T1DM demonstrate that increased physical activity can lower HbA1c levels significantly (by about 0.5 percent). Reducing sedentary time (and in particular screen time) appears to be associated with improved metabolic control in this patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In one large cross-sectional investigation of patients ages 3 to 20 years, the patients doing no regular physical activity had the highest HbA1c levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and increased computer screen time is also associated with poorer metabolic control in this patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Having better cardiorespiratory fitness is not only associated with better glycemic control in adolescents with T1DM but also with reduced glycemic variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], improved health-related quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and improved renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Exercise training can improve the abnormal diastolic function observed in youth with T1DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It should also be noted, however, that a single bout of vigorous exercise temporarily increases microalbuminuria in youth with T1DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9383804\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9383813\"><span class=\"h2\">Aerobic versus anaerobic exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise can be described as either &quot;aerobic&quot; or &quot;anaerobic&quot; in nature. Activities that are continuous, rhythmic in nature, and with repeated movements of the same large muscle groups for at least 10 minutes at a time may be considered &quot;aerobic&quot;. Activities that are primarily resistance in nature, using muscular strength to move a weight or to work against a resistant load, may be considered &quot;anaerobic.&quot; In reality, most sporting activities and games are a combination of both aerobic and anaerobic actions. Both aerobic and anaerobic activities are beneficial for health in the growing child with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>In general, aerobic activities are associated with reductions in blood glucose (BG) concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114556\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114556 \">figure 1</a>). By contrast, anaerobic activities usually do not reduce BG concentrations, and may be associated with elevations in glycemia in certain circumstances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89957\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89957 \">table 1</a>). As an example, sprinting activity tends to increase BG concentrations because it is primarily fueled through anaerobic metabolism and is associated with an increase in plasma catecholamine levels, which promote elevations in glycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A short sprint (10 to 30 seconds) increases blood glucose concentrations in adolescents with T1DM, as long as pre-activity glucose is normal and insulin levels are at a basal concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Many forms of team and individual sports and children's playground activities (such as soccer and other field sports, basketball, and baseball) consist of brief periods of intermittent high intensity (anaerobic) exercise, intermixed with lower intensity (aerobic) activity. This type of mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">anaerobic/aerobic</span> activity tends to have moderating effects on glycemia compared with activities that are purely aerobic (such as walking, jogging, or cycling) or anaerobic (such as sprinting, diving, or weightlifting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9383820\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects of intensity and duration of exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main fuel sources for prolonged aerobic exercise are lipid and carbohydrate, which are derived from both within and outside of the muscle tissue (ie, muscle lipids, muscle glycogen, blood lipids from adipose tissue stores and BG released from liver or from carbohydrate ingestion). The mix of fuel utilization during aerobic exercise (and the amount of disturbance to BG levels) primarily depends on the intensity and duration of the activity as well as the nutrient status of the individual. Initially, the energy used for muscular contraction is derived from stores within the muscle itself, including a very small amount of stored energy in the form of high energy phosphates (adenosine triphosphate [ATP] and phosphocreatine), and a somewhat larger store of glycogen. With increased exercise duration, there is a gradual shift to fuels from outside of the muscle, including plasma free fatty acids (FFA) and BG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. During prolonged exercise, the main sources of BG are from the breakdown of liver glycogen or ingested carbohydrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. With increasing exercise intensity, there is an increasing reliance on carbohydrate as fuel, with reduction in the amount of lipids oxidized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89958\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89958 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>This pattern of fuel utilization is similar between children and adults, except that children and adolescents have a higher relative capacity for fat utilization at nearly all exercise intensities, and are less able to use muscle glycogen as a fuel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The pattern of fuel utilization in individuals with T1DM is similar to those without diabetes, except that the capacity to oxidize orally ingested carbohydrates is slightly impaired, and there may be a slightly higher reliance on muscle glycogen and on lipids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89958\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89958 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p>Glucose oxidation rates are as high as 1.5 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram body mass per hour of activity in children and adolescents with T1DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], yet only about 3 to 4 grams of glucose is stored in the bloodstream of a healthy adolescent at a given point in time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Glycogen stores in liver (40 to 60 grams for a 35 to 50 kg child) and skeletal muscle (150 to 400 grams, depending on the size of the child) represent the main sites of endogenous carbohydrate to fuel exercise. During prolonged exercise, these sources must rapidly restore the circulating supply of glucose to prevent hypoglycemia. Because prolonged moderate-to-high intensity exercise primarily relies on carbohydrate as a fuel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], this type of activity often poses the greatest threat for hypoglycemia and preventive actions are typically required for the patient with T1DM, as discussed below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9383827\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal regulation and counterregulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In non-diabetic humans at rest, progressive decreases in BG concentrations trigger changes in counterregulatory hormones that counteract the fall in glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BG &lt;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> &ndash; Reduction in insulin secretion </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BG &lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> &ndash; Increased secretion of glucagon and epinephrine </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BG &lt;67 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> &ndash; Secretion of norepinephrine and growth hormone (GH) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BG &lt;65 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> &ndash; Secretion of cortisol </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BG &lt;55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> &ndash; Autonomic symptoms develop (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90202\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90202 \">table 2</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BG &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> &ndash; Cognitive function is impaired </p><p/><p>Similar mechanisms are entrained during exercise to maintain normal BG concentrations in the face of elevated glucose disposal into working muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. At the onset of aerobic exercise, insulin release by the beta cells is reduced and there are gradual increases in the glucose counterregulatory hormones (glucagon, catecholamines, GH, and cortisol). This change in hormonal profile increases glucose production and maintains circulating glucose concentrations in a normal range during exercise (approximately 70 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [4.0 to 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. As a result of this redundant counterregulatory system, hypoglycemia rarely occurs during exercise in non-diabetic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. If hypoglycemia does occur, then the counterregulatory hormone response is amplified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. During prolonged exercise, the same counterregulatory hormones help mobilize fuels while limiting peripheral glucose disposal to maintain euglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Other than not being able to lower insulin secretion at the onset of exercise, youth with T1DM appear to have normal counterregulatory hormone responses (glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, GH, and cortisol) to both aerobic and anaerobic exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, the counterregulatory response to developing hypoglycemia during exercise may be impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9383834\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9383843\"><span class=\"h2\">Relative hyperinsulinemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In nondiabetic individuals, exercise induces a rapid decrease in the rate of insulin secretion into the portal vein. This sensitizes the liver to glucagon, thereby allowing for a rapid increase in hepatic glucose production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), it is impossible to mimic this coordinated hormonal response to exercise, because systemic and portal venous concentrations of insulin administered subcutaneously tend to lag behind changes in the physiologic need. As a result, individuals with T1DM tend to have systemic and portal venous hyperinsulinemia during exercise: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic hyperinsulinemia &ndash; In diabetic individuals, the circulating plasma insulin concentration required for good glycemic control at rest results in relative hyperinsulinemia during aerobic exercise. Typically, postprandial insulin levels during exercise may be two- to three-fold higher in the systemic circulation in the adolescent with T1DM than in nondiabetic youth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These elevated insulin concentrations promote peripheral glucose disposal and reduce hepatic glucose production, causing a rapid reduction in blood glucose (BG) concentrations at the onset of exercise. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Portal hyperinsulinemia &ndash; In diabetic individuals, there is little variation in portal venous insulin concentrations because the insulin is typically administered subcutaneously. In particular, changes in insulin concentrations in the portal circulation occur only gradually. At the onset of exercise, these individuals do not experience the rapid decrease in plasma insulin concentration in the portal vein that would normally sensitize the liver to glucagon and increase hepatic glucose production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,40</a>]. </p><p/><p>Because of systemic and portal venous hyperinsulinemia, children with T1DM are at risk for hypoglycemia during exercise. Since the total amount of glucose in the circulation is only about 3 to 4 grams in an exercising child and because exercise increases glucose utilization rates five- to six-fold above the resting rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], hypoglycemia can ensue within minutes if circulating insulin levels are not adjusted for the activity or if exogenous carbohydrates are not consumed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8777344\"><span class=\"h2\">Counterregulatory failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the relative hyperinsulinemia described above, a number of other possible endocrine disturbances may exist in the young patient with T1DM that may place them at an increased risk for exercise-associated hypoglycemia. Young children and adolescents with T1DM have a blunted counterregulatory hormone response to hypoglycemia, even if they have good glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In addition, a recent episode of exercise or hypoglycemia may further impair the glucagon response to exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Factors such as an impaired adrenergic response to hypoglycemia during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] or a reduced level of liver glycogen because of recent hypoinsulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] may also contribute to exercise-associated hypoglycemia in the young patients with type 1 diabetes. A number of factors blunt the counterregulatory hormone response to subsequent exercise and to subsequent hypoglycemia, which may contribute to a vicious cycle that predisposes the individual to a further deterioration in glucose control (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89583\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89583 \">figure 3</a>). Physical exercise appears to increase absorption of subcutaneous insulin, even in patients on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64441725\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9383850\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased physical activity increases hypoglycemia risk by about 30 to 50 percent both during and after exercise (for up to about 12 hours) in children and adolescents with T1DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,46</a>]. This is because exercise enhances insulin sensitivity, in a pattern that depends largely on the time of day and the type and duration of exercise performed. Exercise performed late in the day is associated with a biphasic change in insulin sensitivity, such that heightened insulin sensitivity occurs during the exercise and again 7 to 11 hours later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This increases the risk for hypoglycemia late in recovery, usually when the child or adolescent is sleeping, because of multiple impairments in the counterregulatory response to exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] and to hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], as described above. In contrast, exercise performed earlier in the day does not appear to follow this biphasic pattern of increased insulin sensitivity; instead, heightened insulin sensitivity is sustained for at least 11 hours after the exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. For a given bout of exercise, afternoon exercise appears to increase hypoglycemia risk compared with morning exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. As an example, 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise performed in the late afternoon in youth with T1DM is associated with a 30 percent increased risk for hypoglycemia during the night and following day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9383857\"><span class=\"h3\">Immediate hypoglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even moderate exercise causes hypoglycemia in a substantial number of children with T1DM. In one study of 50 children and adolescents with T1DM performing mild exercise (four 15 minute bouts of walking on a treadmill, each separated by five minute rest periods), 30 percent developed hypoglycemia during the activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Among those with a pre-exercise blood glucose (BG) &lt;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> 86 percent became hypoglycemic.

The risk in children appears to be greater than for adults with T1DM, perhaps because children tend to be much more physically active than adults. </p><p>Nocturnal hypoglycemia is most likely to occur during the early morning hours (around 2 to 3 AM), although it can occur at any time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/48,55,58-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,55,58-62</a>]. This pattern can be triggered, in particular, by exercise during the afternoon, which increases insulin sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] and blunts glucose counterregulatory hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. As an example, in a study of 50 adolescents performing just 60 minutes of mild exercise in the afternoon, 48 percent developed nocturnal hypoglycemia (with a nadir at approximately 2 AM), or required carbohydrate treatment to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Hyperglycemia and excessive ketosis during exercise are particularly undesirable as they can cause dehydration and may decrease blood pH, both of which impair exercise performance and place the child at risk for metabolic deterioration into ketoacidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

Management of glycemia is further complicated by participation in team sports that require bursts of intense activity punctuated by rests in play (eg, baseball, basketball, or hockey), in which case the periods of inactivity also contribute to the risk for hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,69</a>]. Short bouts of intense resistance-type exercise also increases BG levels, which can be corrected with judicious insulin administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychological stress of competition &ndash; Psychological stress also may induce cortisol, catecholamines, and interleukin-6 release and promote insulin resistance in youth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Even the stress of video game playing can promote increases in glucose counterregulatory hormones and hyperglycemia in youth with T1DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. The clinical relevance of this phenomenon is that patients may develop hyperglycemia just before competition even if they are able to maintain good glycemic control in the preceding days. This means that some individuals may need to compensate for psychological stress during competition by taking slightly more insulin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reducing carbohydrate intake, as compared with their standard glycemia management for exercise. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Environmental factors &ndash; Some individuals find that training or competing in warm and humid environments also elevates BG concentration, likely because of excessive increases in circulating plasma catecholamines, glucagon, cortisol, and GH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. On the other hand, exercise in warm environments also increases subcutaneous insulin absorption rates, which accelerates the insulin's hypoglycemic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. As a result, the effect of a warm environment on BG may not be consistent or predictable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Errors in insulin and carbohydrate management &ndash; Hyperglycemia during or after sport can also be caused by excessive consumption of carbohydrates, insufficient insulin administration, excessive reductions in basal or bolus insulin delivery, prolonged insulin pump removal (&gt;2 hours), a blocked infusion set in patients on an insulin pump, or from missed insulin injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/67,76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,76,77</a>].</p><p/><p>Hyperglycemia that occurs during exercise must be managed cautiously; a full insulin correction bolus in an attempt to correct the hyperglycemia at the start of exercise may lead to hypoglycemia during or after the activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/47,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,76</a>]. If BG levels rise above 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> during exercise, a partial insulin bolus correction may be warranted (eg, use 50 percent of the usual correction bolus), followed by frequent BG monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Post-exercise hyperglycemia is also a common phenomenon, because glucose uptake into muscle slows while glucose production is maintained at a high rate as a result of reduced circulating serum insulin levels (if adjustments in insulin are performed) and increases in glucose counterregulatory hormone and circulating lipid levels. Patients using an insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, CSII) appear to have a smaller rise in BG at the end of exercise as compared with those on multiple daily injection (MDI) treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9384126\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR EXERCISE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The child or adolescent with T1DM should be encouraged to engage in a wide variety of physical activities, with minimal restrictions, but with careful management to avoid the risks for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that are outlined above.

If ketones are negative and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels are &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> then mild to moderate exercise can be performed, since this will typically lower glycemia. However, intense exercise (sprinting, resistance training, etc.) should be delayed even if ketones are not present until glucose levels are improved (ie, &lt;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> since intense exercise may exaggerate the hyperglycemia.

The rapid production of ketone bodies during intense exercise may precipitate ketoacidotic abdominal pain and vomiting. If these symptoms occur, exercise should be terminated and the individual should be promptly evaluated and treated.

Carbohydrates are the predominant substrate utilized during high-intensity exercise. The carbohydrate supply in the circulation is minimal and must be continuously replenished during exercise, primarily from the much larger stores of endogenous carbohydrates in the liver and skeletal muscle. </p><p>Strategies to enhance the available stores of carbohydrates during exercise include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in exogenous insulin dose &ndash; Reducing the insulin dose given prior to exercise reduces the risk for hypoglycemia and the need for exogenous carbohydrates. (See <a href=\"#H9383951\" class=\"local\">'Insulin management and adjustments'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consumption of extra carbohydrates &ndash; Children or adolescents with T1DM generally need to consume extra carbohydrates prior to, during, and after exercise activity that lasts more than 60 minutes. This strategy also is most practical for the spontaneously active child, for whom exercise is not always predictable. The quantity and timing of the extra doses of carbohydrates depend on many factors, including the intensity and duration of the exercise, as detailed in the following sections. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9383923\"><span class=\"h3\">Carbohydrate intake before and during exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If no insulin adjustments are made in anticipation of exercise, then additional carbohydrates are usually needed to prevent hypoglycemia. The carbohydrate requirements vary widely, ranging from 15 to 40 grams of carbohydrates per 30 minutes of activity. At least a portion of this should be consumed about 15 to 30 minutes before the activity if BG is in the normal range or just slightly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-84</a>]. In one small study of youth with T1DM, 0.5 grams of <span class=\"nowrap\">carbohydrate/kg</span> body mass per hour of exercise (about 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/lb</span> body mass per hour of exercise) helped to maintain BG concentrations during aerobic exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The type of carbohydrate (fast-acting versus slow-acting) should also be considered; a rapidly absorbed simple carbohydrate (eg, dextrose) will appear in the blood stream within minutes of consumption, while a low glycemic index meal or snack (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maltodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">maltodextrin</a>) will help to prevent hypoglycemia for up to several hours because of its slow breakdown in the gastrointestinal system. The wide range in pre-exercise carbohydrate requirement typically reflects the size of the child and the wide variation in exercise timing with respect to mealtime bolus insulin injection. For example, if adolescents are exercising at a time of low insulin action (eg, more than three hours after a mealtime bolus of rapid-acting insulin), then less pre-exercise carbohydrate feeding may be necessary compared with individuals performing exercise during peak insulin action (eg, 30 to 45 minutes after a bolus or rapid-acting insulin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p>One approach to calculating the total amount of carbohydrates needed before and during exercise is to use a table of carbohydrate equivalents, which estimate the rate of carbohydrate utilization during various forms of sport activity, assuming that the insulin dose was not reduced in anticipation of the activity. The carbohydrate requirement calculated using this approach is sometimes termed &quot;Extra carbohydrates for Exercise&quot;, or &quot;Ex-carbs&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89960\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89960 \">table 3</a>). These tables are only guidelines, and individual BG responses to exercise and to carbohydrates vary considerably [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. </p><p>If insulin dose reductions have been made in anticipation of increased activity, then the amount of &quot;extra&quot; carbohydrates required to maintain euglycemia may be as little as a few grams per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. On the other hand, if the activity is performed during peak insulin action, then as much as 1.0 to 1.5 grams of <span class=\"nowrap\">carbohydrate/kg</span> body weight per hour of activity may be needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23</a>]. This &quot;extra&quot; carbohydrate should be in the form of rapid-acting, high-glycemic index snacks or carbohydrate-electrolyte drinks, and should be consumed without any insulin administration in divided portions during the activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. For example, a 40 kg child who is swimming for half an hour should consume 27 grams of extra carbohydrate (ie, 9 grams about 15 minutes before and at 0 and 15 minutes during the activity) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89960\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89960 \">table 3</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9383944\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-exercise recovery period and protein intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the recovery period after moderate or vigorous exercise, it is generally helpful to consume a snack consisting of mixed protein and carbohydrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Examples of recovery snacks include dairy-based fruit smoothies, low-fat milk shakes, yogurt drinks, fruit mixed with yogurt. The snack should generally be taken with insulin to avoid post-exercise hyperglycemia. The mixed composition of the snack helps to avoid post-exercise late-onset hypoglycemia, and also supports protein synthesis. Children and adolescents have higher protein requirements relative to adults to support maturational growth. Protein requirements in young athletes are higher than in non-athletes, approaching approximately 1.7 grams <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/kg</span> body weight daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9383951\"><span class=\"h2\">Insulin management and adjustments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alterations to insulin delivery may be the best way to attempt to mimic the normal physiological response to exercise (ie, less insulin for steady state aerobic exercise; more insulin for brief high intensity exercise).

These individuals should be encouraged to engage in a wide variety of physical activities, with minimal restrictions, but with careful management to avoid the associated risks for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H54652485\" class=\"local\">'Benefits of exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, aerobic physical activity (such as walking, cycling, and general play) tends to lower blood glucose (BG) concentrations, while anaerobic physical activity (such as sprinting, hockey, or weightlifting) tends to increase BG concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89957\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89957 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114556\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114556 \">figure 1</a>). In situations in which glucose levels are elevated, mild aerobic exercise is preferred, as long as ketone levels in the blood are normal or only minimally elevated. Many forms of team and individual sports and children's playground activities (such as soccer and other field sports, basketball, and baseball) consist of mixed aerobic and anaerobic activity. In healthy children without T1DM, BG is maintained in the normal range during exercise by a robust counterregulatory hormonal response to any deviations in BG. (See <a href=\"#H9383804\" class=\"local\">'Exercise physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children and adolescents with T1DM are at increased risk for hypoglycemia, which may occur during and immediately after exercise, or may be delayed for several hours and occur during sleep. The mechanisms include increased insulin sensitivity, relative hyperinsulinemia, and a blunted response of the counterregulatory hormones. Conversely, exercise also can cause hyperglycemia in certain circumstances, especially during high-intensity anaerobic exercise such as sprinting, and in individuals in poor metabolic control. Hyperglycemia is sometimes triggered by emotional stress during competition. (See <a href=\"#H9383850\" class=\"local\">'Hypoglycemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9383871\" class=\"local\">'Hyperglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following protocols are important to avoid dangerous episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia during and after exercise: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The BG concentration should be checked prior to exercise, and if BG is elevated, the urine or blood should also be checked for ketones. If ketones are present in the urine, along with elevated BG concentration, intense (vigorous) exercise should be suspended until BG levels are restored, whereas mild exercise is encouraged. The target range for BG prior to exercise is between 90 and 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5 and 13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H60831791\" class=\"local\">'Blood glucose targets for start of exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Interventions to prevent hypoglycemia during exercise include consumption of additional carbohydrates just before and during exercise, reduction of the basal insulin dose prior to exercise, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduction of the pre-meal insulin bolus for postprandial exercise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89766\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89766 \">table 4</a>). These interventions should be selected based on baseline BG levels, the intensity and duration of the exercise, and the patient's past BG response to exercise. (See <a href=\"#H9383907\" class=\"local\">'Approaches to glycemic management during exercise'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BG should be monitored about every 30 minutes during the exercise, and carbohydrate consumption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89960\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89960 \">table 3</a>) or insulin dose adjusted accordingly to maintain euglycemia. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using a subcutaneous device is especially valuable for patients who are physically active. (See <a href=\"#H9383972\" class=\"local\">'Blood glucose monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9383923\" class=\"local\">'Carbohydrate intake before and during exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Delayed (nocturnal) hypoglycemia occurs in a substantial number of children after engaging in exercise in the afternoon. This risk can be addressed by increased frequency of BG monitoring during the recovery period and before bedtime, ensuring that a bedtime snack is consumed, and in some cases by reducing the basal insulin infusion in the evening. (See <a href=\"#H9383864\" class=\"local\">'Delayed (nocturnal) hypoglycemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9383965\" class=\"local\">'Insulin pump (CSII)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hyperglycemia that occurs during exercise can be corrected with small amounts of rapid-acting insulin. However, caution is warranted because exercise increases insulin sensitivity, so the patient may also be at risk for delayed hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H9383871\" class=\"local\">'Hyperglycemia'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Students with T1DM may fully participate in physical education classes and team sports at school provided that there is good communication and collaboration between the student, his or her healthcare provider and parents, the school nurse, and the physical education instructor or team coach, and good adherence to a well-designed regimen for glycemic control during and after exercise. The supervising staff must be trained to recognize and treat hypoglycemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90202\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90202 \">table 2</a>), and the student should have ready access to BG monitoring equipment and fast-acting carbohydrates. (See <a href=\"#H9383994\" class=\"local\">'Schools'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-exercise-for-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Robertson K, Riddell MC, Guinhouya BC, et al.
