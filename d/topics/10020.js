They can arise from mesenchymal tissue at any body site. Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are uncommon. In the United States, approximately 13,040 cases are diagnosed annually, representing less than 1 percent of all newly diagnosed malignant tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although surgical resection is, as a general rule, a necessary prerequisite for cure, the addition of radiation therapy is recommended for most patients with an STS of the extremities or chest wall to minimize the risk of a local recurrence, and to maximize function and long-term survival. </p><p>This topic will provide an overview of multimodality treatment of STS arising in the extremities and chest wall. The following issues are discussed separately: classification, diagnosis, and staging of STS; radiation-related sarcomas; STS arising in the head and neck, retroperitoneum, and breast; surgical resection of potentially resectable STS of the extremities; management of locally advanced, unresectable STS; and adjuvant as well as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the types of STS that typically arise in adults.

The multidisciplinary team approach to care of STS optimizes treatment planning, minimizes duplication of diagnostic studies, and reduces the time to implementation of the definitive therapeutic protocol.</p><p>Moreover, the expertise gained by dedicated subspecialists improves clinical outcomes. This was illustrated by one study that examined outcomes of 375 patients with STS of the extremities and torso according to the time of referral to a tumor center in the South Sweden Health Care Region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Compared with patients referred preoperatively, local recurrence rates were 2.4-fold higher in patients not referred at any time and 1.3-fold higher in those referred only after definitive surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTREMITY SARCOMAS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1112326063\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In treating extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS), the major therapeutic goals are survival, avoidance of a local recurrence, maximizing function, and minimizing morbidity. There are a wide variety of clinical situations that arise from involvement of a variety of different anatomic sites, the range of histologies, and variability in grade and tumor size. As a result, for most patients, treatment must be individualized. The following suggestions serve as a general guide to therapy: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our recommended treatment for most patients with an extremity STS who are medically and technically operable is combined surgery and radiation therapy (RT). In most instances, the probability of tumor control is higher, and the late functional and cosmetic result is superior following combined modality therapy than with radical surgery alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The multidisciplinary management of sarcoma must be individualized, taking into account the patient's functional status, the heterogeneity of tumor behavior, and the location of the tumor. However, in general, surgical excision alone is usually reserved for patients with small (&lt;5 cm), low-grade, and especially superficial (superficial to the fascia) sarcomas. Surgery alone may be also considered for select patients with small intramuscular sarcomas, even if higher grade, provided that adequate surgical margins can be obtained. RT is recommended in addition to resection for the remainder of sarcoma patients. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Preoperative RT is associated with similar oncologic outcomes to postoperative RT, but there is a difference in toxicity profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative versus postoperative RT'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications#H3543456663\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications&quot;, section on 'Radiation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to oncologic control, sarcoma management must prioritize preservation of function, especially in extremity sarcomas. When radical resection will compromise a functional extremity, various neoadjuvant approaches have been explored, especially in patients with large, intermediate- or high-grade extremity lesions. There are no randomized trials comparing various treatments. In our view, if trial participation is not feasible, chemoradiotherapy is an alternative to RT alone for medically fit patients with a good performance status and high- to intermediate-grade large (&gt;5 cm) tumors. The optimal chemoradiotherapy approach is not established, and the choice is usually based upon institutional expertise, experience, and preferences. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Initial chemoradiotherapy for large high-grade STS'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, for patients with large, locally advanced or recurrent extremity STS, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be administered systemically in conjunction with regional hyperthermia or regionally (intraarterially), using procedures such as isolated limb infusion and isolated limb perfusion. These treatments are not widely available in the United States, but where available, they represent potentially limb-preserving options. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-locally-recurrent-and-unresectable-locally-advanced-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of locally recurrent and unresectable, locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Chemotherapy with regional hyperthermia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-locally-recurrent-and-unresectable-locally-advanced-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of locally recurrent and unresectable, locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Regional chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for common adult STS of the extremities continues to be debated, and there is little consensus as to the indications or specific benefit. The appropriateness of adjuvant chemotherapy should be addressed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the patient's performance status, comorbid factors (including age), disease location, tumor size, and histologic subtype. The potential for benefit must be discussed in the context of expected treatment-related toxicities, including sterility in younger individuals, cardiomyopathy, renal damage, second cancers, and overall impairment of quality of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Sarcomas more commonly seen in adults'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1214006674\"><span class=\"h3\">Guidelines from expert groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach parallels consensus-based guidelines for multidisciplinary management of soft tissue tumors of the extremity and trunk, which are available from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and the <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=Uq9WYRsg9p/PSM9vt3rBGtHa7uSejixwk2tJVlS5LMeu0awaX/Er3fekhDozpt3zew+Yt0LRtO7qp5BoCEEM5YoFu3K3VNa+mIo9yk7LJGM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7734\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wide surgical resection of the primary tumor (total en bloc excision of the primary tumor without cutting into tumor tissue and having an adequate margin of normal tissue completely surrounding the tumor) is the essential component of treatment for virtually all patients with extremity STS. For most patients, resection of the tumor with adequate surgical margins is possible and preserves a functional limb; however, primary amputation may be the best alternative in small subset of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities#H3777189870\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Primary amputation'</a>.)</p><p>The resection should take place through tissues outside of the tumor pseudocapsule, if one exists, through apparently normal uninvolved tissue. Violation of the tumor (ie, intralesional surgery or a resection that results in gross or microscopic residual tumor) is associated with a higher local failure rate, even if RT is used. The status of the surgical margins is the most important surgical variable that influences local control; however, the exact width (thickness) of the negative margin that is optimal for local control is not known. The exact amount of normal tissue necessary for an &quot;adequate&quot; margin is not well defined and probably depends on the type of tissue. As an example, a fascial margin can be thinner than a muscle or fatty margin. Most clinicians recommend that, if surgery is used as the sole modality of treatment, the margin should be at least 1 cm in all directions or include a fascial barrier, but this type of margin is seldom achieved in all margins of a tumor, especially around the neurovascular bundle. If surgery is combined with RT, it is generally accepted that the surgical margin may be less thick without compromising local control. Rotational flaps or free tissue transfers may be necessary to achieve wound closure. In most cases, regional node dissection is usually only recommended if there is clinical or radiologic evidence of regional nodal disease. The principles of surgical resection (including issues related to the regional nodes) for extremity STS are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities#H1572311993\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Sarcoma resection and reconstruction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of RT in conjunction with resection lessens the necessity for amputation and increases the potential to resect sarcomas while maintaining functional outcomes and acceptable cancer outcomes. The combination of limb-sparing surgery and RT achieves better local control than either modality alone for the majority of STS, although no improvement in survival has been demonstrated.</p><p>Adjuvant RT improves local control and has also had a significant impact on rates of limb salvage for extremity STS. In the 1970s, up to one-half of patients with extremity STS underwent amputation. With the emergence of RT and advanced reconstructive techniques, the rate of amputation has been reduced to approximately 1 percent without any measurable fall in overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. </p><p>The benefit of adding RT to limb-sparing surgery has been addressed in two randomized trials, both of which showed that the combination of limb-sparing surgery and RT reduced the risk of local recurrence by 20 to 25 percent when compared with limb-sparing surgery alone but did not improve overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. However, these trials were not adequately powered to demonstrate any small differences in survival. Although there are many limitations to this type of study, lower level evidence from an analysis of a large number of patients with STS reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database suggests a modest overall survival benefit for the addition of adjuvant RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. When combined with limb-sparing surgery, RT at moderate dose levels (50 to 65 Gy) can effectively eradicate microscopic disease extension beyond the gross lesion, resulting in rates of local control that are comparable to those achieved with amputation or radical surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. With combined therapy, most series report local control rates of approximately 85 to 90 percent for high-grade extremity STS and 90 to 100 percent for low-grade STS, depending upon size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/3,5,14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,14-19</a>].</p><p>Adjuvant RT at higher doses can also improve outcomes in patients with positive margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The largest experience comes from a retrospective review of 154 patients with resected STS at any anatomic site (105 extremity, nine truncal) who had positive resection margins and who underwent RT with curative intent over a 31-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. At five years, rates of local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival for the entire cohort were 76, 47, and 65 percent, respectively. Outcomes were most favorable for patients with extremity primaries (five-year local control, disease-free, and overall survival 82, 48, and 66 percent, respectively); those who received an RT dose &gt;64 Gy; and those who had microscopic (rather than grossly visible) margins, tumor size &lt;5 cm, and a superficial rather than deep location. Among patients receiving RT doses &gt;64 Gy, 85 percent achieved local control at five years. </p><p>However, because local control is still worse with positive as compared with negative margins, reresection to negative margins is preferred if additional conservative surgery can be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities#H2776815620\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Inadequate initial resection'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal timing of RT (ie, preoperative versus postoperative) is discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative versus postoperative RT'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2025128209\"><span class=\"h3\">Are there patients for whom RT is not needed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While it is well documented that the risk of a local recurrence is higher for high-grade tumors, low-grade tumors do not uniformly carry a low risk of local recurrence. In one of the randomized trials, the improvement in local control in irradiated patients appeared to be limited to patients with high-grade histopathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but in the other, there was a significant reduction in risk for low-grade tumors as well (5 versus 30 percent local recurrence rate for patients treated with surgery alone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Nevertheless, based upon these results as well as retrospective and population-based registry series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/22-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-30</a>], there appear to be some patients with low-grade extremity STS who do not require adjuvant RT. The identification of this subset remains challenging, in large part because of the difficulty in quantifying the risk of a local recurrence for individual patients based upon the usual features used to estimate prognosis such as size, depth, and histologic grade. As noted above, in general, we reserve surgical excision alone for patients with superficial, low-grade tumors that are 5 cm or less in diameter, as well as selected patients with small, purely intramuscular tumors, even if higher grade, provided that adequate surgical margins can be obtained. </p><p>A postoperative nomogram, which was based upon data from 684 patients with an extremity sarcoma treated with limb-sparing surgery alone at Memorial Sloan Kettering over a 24-year period, has been proposed to predict local recurrence rates at three and five years after limb-sparing surgery without RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The nomogram includes five independent predictors of recurrence: age, size, margin status, grade, and histology. While this nomogram may be a useful tool to estimate the risk of a local recurrence in an individual patient, the appropriate cutoff point for deciding that the risk justifies the addition of RT is unclear. Furthermore, the nomogram has not been independently validated. In our view, decisions about adjuvant RT must be individualized, and made on a case-by-case basis by an experienced multidisciplinary team.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative versus postoperative RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjunctive RT can be administered preoperatively (neoadjuvant RT) or postoperatively (adjuvant RT). There are potential advantages of both approaches. Preoperative RT might be expected to reduce tumor burden, theoretically allowing more conservative surgical therapy. Postoperative RT allows histologic examination of the tumor specimen and is also associated with fewer wound complications.

The 94 patients assigned to preoperative therapy all received 50 Gy prior to surgery with a postoperative boost (16 to 20 Gy) given to the 14 patients with a positive margin. All patients in the postoperative group received 50 Gy to the initial field plus a 16 to 20 Gy boost. Complications were defined as secondary wound surgery, hospital admission for wound care, or the need for deep packing or prolonged wound dressings within 120 days of tumor resection. The study was terminated when a highly significant result was obtained at the time of a planned interim analysis. With a median follow-up of 3.3 years, acute wound complications were significantly more common with preoperative treatment (35 versus 17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other factors associated with acute wound complications were the volume of resected tissue and lower limb location of the tumor.</p><p>In the latest update (median follow-up of 6.9 years), there was no difference in local control with preoperative versus postoperative RT, with over 90 percent of patients controlled locally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The regional and distant failure rates as well as the progression-free and overall survival rates were also similar. However, patients treated postoperatively developed significantly more grade 2 to 4 late toxicity compared with those treated preoperatively (86 versus 68 percent, respectively). In particular, the incidence of grade 3 (severe induration and loss of subcutaneous tissue or field contracture &gt;10 percent linear measurement) or grade 4 (necrosis) subcutaneous fibrosis was significantly higher in the postoperative group (36 versus 23 percent, respectively).</p><p>Although not statistically significant, limb edema (23 versus 16 percent) and joint stiffness (23 versus 18 percent) were both more common in the postoperative treatment group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Fibrosis, edema, and joint stiffness adversely affected functional outcomes.</p><p>The Canadian study demonstrates that efficacy is similar using preoperative or postoperative RT, and that the higher rate of generally reversible acute wound healing complications in preoperatively treated patients is offset by a lower rate of generally irreversible late complications, including grade 3 to 4 fibrosis. Because very few acute wound-healing complications occurred in either group with tumors located in the upper extremity (a finding that is reported by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]), the authors suggested that these patients preferentially receive preoperative RT. We also favor the preoperative approach for most patients with lower extremity sarcomas, on the basis that acute wound complications can usually be managed and will eventually heal in the long run, while late treatment effects are generally irreversible.</p><p>Nevertheless, postoperative RT is still a reasonable option. Patients for whom postoperative radiation may be preferred include: those with infiltrative subcutaneous myxofibrosarcomas where it is very difficult to define an appropriate preoperative radiation target volume based on preoperative imaging; patients in whom surgery alone might represent appropriate treatment as determined after review of the surgical margins; and patients who are anticipated to have particularly high rates of acute wound healing problems after preoperative radiation, such as obese or diabetic patients with subcutaneous tumors (in whom the subcutaneous tissues cannot be spared from radiation).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H943572101\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative IMRT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) with sparing of the proposed surgical flap for resection of lower extremity STS was assessed in a prospective phase II study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Preoperative radiation is generally only delivered to a single clinical target volume (see below) for the majority of patients, with any additional radiation to a reduced field reserved for postoperative treatment of the small proportion of patients with a histologically positive margin. Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) treatment planning systems allow smaller and more accurate treatment volumes in patients with extremity STS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. These systems also allow image fusion with the MRI scans to better define the target volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical target volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal clinical target volume (CTV) is debated. There are no data from controlled trials that address the appropriate CTV for patients with extremity or chest wall STS. Radiation fields traditionally included a generous longitudinal margin of 5 to 10 cm beyond the gross tumor. These fields were conceived in the era before the routine use of MRI (see below). The use of 5 cm proximal and distal margins and 2 cm radial margins for the first 50 Gy (on the tumor for preoperative radiation therapy [RT] and the surgical bed for postoperative therapy) provided very high rates of local control in the randomized National Cancer Institute (NCI) Canada trial discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative versus postoperative RT'</a> above.)</p><p>The radial margin should be viewed with respect to the direction of most likely spread; the margin can be 1.5 to 2 cm where there is bone, interosseous membrane, or major fascial planes, and imaging studies show these planes to be intact. When a fascial plane has been violated, the 2 cm rule no longer applies and wider margins are appropriate.</p><p>The 2 cm radial margin rule is rationally derived from surgical experience. Local control rates are high when margins exceed 1 cm. The additional centimeter added to the RT margins allows for some daily set-up variation and the penumbra of the beam edge.</p><p>Newer data on carefully selected patients treated with surgery alone show excellent local control in cases with the closest histologically negative margin 1 cm or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This has prompted interest in tailoring the CTV more closely to the distribution of microscopic residual tumor beyond the grossly visible tumor.</p><p>The distribution of microscopic residual tumor was addressed in a study correlating MRI findings with histopathology of the resected specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Sarcoma cells were identified histologically in the tissues beyond the tumor in 10 of 15 cases. In six cases, tumor cells were located within 1 cm of the tumor margin, and in four cases, malignant cells were found at a distance &gt;1 cm and up to a maximum of 4 cm; in 9 of 10 cases, the tumor cells were located in areas of edema as imaged on T2-weighted MRI scans.</p><p>Thus, MRI is increasingly being used to define the preoperative CTV. Patterns of local failure were studied in 56 patients treated with MRI-guided 3D-CRT field planning for extremity STS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. The CTV included the T1 post-gadolinium-defined gross tumor volume (GTV) with 1 to 1.5 cm radial and 3.5 cm longitudinal margins. Planning target volume expansion was 5 to 7 mm, and &gt;95 percent of the dose was delivered to the planning target volume. The median preoperative RT dose was 50 Gy. Postoperative boost of 10 to 20 Gy was given to 12 patients (six with positive margins and six with close margins). Three patients (all with positive margins) experienced local failure as first relapse (two isolated, one with distant failure), and two additional patients (all with margin&lt;1 mm) had late local failure after distant metastasis. The local failures were within the CTV in three patients, and within and also extending beyond the CTV in two. No local recurrences were observed in patients whose surgical margins were &gt;1 mm.</p><p>Thus, these target volume definitions appear to be appropriate for most patients, although some patients with particularly infiltrative histologies such as some subcutaneous myxofibrosarcomas might require more generous margins.</p><p>Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) study 0630, testing the use of even more constrained CTVs in the setting of image-guided preoperative RT, suggested that this approach leads to a significant reduction in late toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The CTV encompassed the gross tumor plus 2 cm margins (for low-grade tumors and for intermediate- and high-grade tumors &lt;8 cm in size) or 3 cm margins (for tumors &gt;8 cm) in the longitudinal (proximal and distal) directions as well as any areas of suspicious edema (defined by MRI T2 images). If this caused the field to extend beyond the compartment, the field could be shortened to include the end of a compartment plus a margin of 1 cm. The radial margin from the lesion for low-grade tumors and for intermediate- and high-grade tumors &lt;8 cm was 1.0 cm, and it was 1.5 cm for intermediate- and high-grade tumors &gt;8 cm, including any portion of the tumor not confined by an intact fascial barrier, or uninvolved bone or skin surface. The final report focused on 79 eligible patients treated with image-guided RT (IGRT) without concurrent chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 3.6 years, there were only five local treatment failures, all of which were in the radiated field (ie, there were no marginal field recurrences). Of the 57 patients assessed for late toxicity at two years, 10.5 percent experienced at least one grade &ge;2 toxicity. This number compares favorably with the 37 percent rate of grade &ge;2 late toxicity reported in the preoperative RT alone arm of the NCIC trial described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

If local control from the RTOG 0630 study described above remains high, smaller target volumes might be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For postoperative RT, a similar expansion on the &quot;tumor bed&quot; is recommended for the elective CTV, which should also include the surgically manipulated tissues, as well as the surgical scar and drain site if feasible.

They can arise from mesenchymal tissue at any body site. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of their rarity and the frequent need for multimodality treatment, evaluation and management of STS should ideally be carried out in a center with expertise in the treatment of sarcomas, including surgical, orthopedic, medical, pediatric, radiation oncology, and rehabilitative medicine. (See <a href=\"#H7790646\" class=\"local\">'Importance of multidisciplinary evaluation and management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical behavior of chest wall sarcomas is similar to that of extremity STS, and in our view and that of the <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp#site&amp;token=KVRKaAygvvJD1E58VlEWX1VnwiMJk6ES6siEg2ZEkxcvEZXJ0oPqqP7nnraF23B1m3ddPGRG+/OILdUZuWaBR7bvmNwO/yMFZatbDyoIztg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7734\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a>, these tumors should be treated similarly to extremity sarcomas. (See <a href=\"#H213084029\" class=\"local\">'Chest wall sarcomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In treating STS of the extremities and chest wall, the major therapeutic goals are patient survival, avoidance of a local recurrence, maximizing function, and minimizing morbidity. There are a wide variety of clinical situations that arise from involvement of a variety of different anatomic sites, the range of histologies, and variability in grade and tumor size. As a result, for most patients with either an extremity or chest wall sarcoma, treatment must be individualized. The following suggestions can serve as a useful guide to therapy, and they generally parallel consensus-based recommendations for multidisciplinary management of extremity and truncal sarcomas from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp#site&amp;token=KVRKaAygvvJD1E58VlEWX1VnwiMJk6ES6siEg2ZEkxcvEZXJ0oPqqP7nnraF23B1m3ddPGRG+/OILdUZuWaBR7bvmNwO/yMFZatbDyoIztg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7734\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a>. (See <a href=\"#H1112326063\" class=\"local\">'General approach to treatment'</a> above.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgical resection of the primary tumor is an essential component of treatment for virtually all patients. The guiding principle is total en bloc excision of the primary tumor along with an intact margin of normal surrounding tissue and avoidance of violating the tumor plane. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For patients who are medically inoperable, or if a function-preserving resection is not possible and amputation is not accepted, radiation therapy (RT) alone is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H2444717021\" class=\"local\">'Definitive RT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The multidisciplinary management of sarcoma must be individualized, taking into account the patient's functional status, the heterogeneity of tumor behavior, and the location of the tumor. However, in general, surgical excision alone is usually reserved for patients with small (&lt;5 cm), low-grade, and especially superficial (superficial to the fascia) sarcomas. Surgery alone may be also considered for select patients with small intramuscular sarcomas, even if higher grade, provided that adequate surgical margins can be obtained. The exact amount of normal tissue necessary for an &quot;adequate&quot; margin is not well defined and probably depends on the type of tissue. For example, a fascial margin can be thinner than a muscle or fatty margin. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For all other sarcomas, we recommend the addition of RT to surgical excision to improve local control (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Preoperative RT is associated with similar oncologic outcomes to postoperative RT, but there is a difference in toxicity profile. In general, for &gt;5 cm, deep-seated, intermediate- or high-grade tumors of either the extremities or the chest wall, we suggest preoperative rather than postoperative RT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative versus postoperative RT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For large, low-grade, deep tumors where the surgeon expects close or positive margins, we prefer preoperative radiation. Patients for whom postoperative radiation may be preferred include those with infiltrative subcutaneous myxofibrosarcomas, where it is very difficult to define an appropriate preoperative radiation target volume based on preoperative imaging, patients in whom surgery alone might represent appropriate treatment, as determined after review of the surgical margins, and patients anticipated to have particularly high rates of acute wound healing problems after preoperative radiation, including obese or diabetic patients with subcutaneous tumors (in whom the subcutaneous tissues cannot be spared from RT).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In addition to oncologic control, sarcoma management must prioritize preservation of function, especially in extremity sarcomas. When radical resection will compromise a functional extremity, various neoadjuvant approaches have been explored, especially in patients with large, intermediate- or high-grade extremity lesions. If trial participation is not feasible, we consider that chemoradiotherapy is a reasonable alternative to preoperative RT alone for medically fit patients with a good performance status and intermediate- or high-grade STS larger than5 cm in diameter. The specific approach (concurrent chemoradiotherapy with single-agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> or some other agent, multiagent concurrent chemoradiotherapy, or sequential chemotherapy followed by RT) is not established and depends upon institutional expertise, experience, and preference. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Initial chemoradiotherapy for large high-grade STS'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-locally-recurrent-and-unresectable-locally-advanced-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of locally recurrent and unresectable, locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The role of adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial. Outside of the context of a clinical trial, the appropriateness of adjuvant chemotherapy should be addressed on a case by case basis, taking into consideration the patient's performance status, comorbid factors (including age), disease location, tumor size, and histologic subtype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Adjuvant chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following treatment, for patients with stage II or III disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110711 \">table 4</a>), we suggest a history and physical examination and chest imaging every three to six months for two to three years, then every six months for the next two years, then annually. Following treatment of stage I disease, we suggest a history and physical examination at three- to six-month intervals for the first two years, and yearly thereafter. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients at higher risk of local recurrence, such as those with positive margins or whose primary tumor site is not easily examined, we perform periodic imaging of the primary site at four- to six-month intervals for the first two years, and then yearly out to five years.
