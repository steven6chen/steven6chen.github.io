Support for an early aggressive approach to treatment is based upon the observations that joint damage, which may ultimately result in disability, begins early in the course of disease and that the longer active disease persists, the less likely the patient is to respond to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Improved outcomes have resulted from the use of potent and well-tolerated nonbiologic (traditional) and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) used alone and in combination to induce and maintain tight control of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/2-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-10</a>]. These medications and strategies have the potential to control synovitis and slow or stop radiographic progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/2,9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,11,12</a>].</p><p>These observations regarding the course of disease and the efficacy of these therapeutic approaches, coupled with limits in the ability to accurately identify individuals with a poor prognosis, support our view that every patient with established active RA should be treated with DMARDs at the earliest stage of disease, ideally within three months of symptom onset.

We initiate DMARD therapy as early in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as possible because delayed use of such medications results in poorer physical function and increased joint injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].

A chest radiograph should be obtained prior to initiating treatment with MTX. Although not conclusive, observational data have suggested that there may be an increased risk of MTX hypersensitivity pneumonitis in patients with underlying pulmonary disease, and having a baseline chest radiograph in these patients would be helpful for subsequent comparison if needed.

The optimal starting dose and schedule for dose escalation are uncertain. We suggest initiating therapy at a dose between 7.5 and 15 mg once weekly for most patients, depending upon the degree of disease activity, the size and age of the patient, the presence of comorbidities, and renal function. As examples, we would treat a 70-year-old patient weighing 55 kg with moderately active disease with an initial dose of 7.5 mg once weekly, while an otherwise healthy 30-year-old patient weighing 80 kg with highly active disease would be started on 15 mg once weekly. A lower initial dose is essential in patients with reduced renal function, defined as an eGFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Dosing of MTX'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Dose titration'</a>.)</p><p>The MTX dose is increased as tolerated and as needed to control symptoms and signs of arthritis. Our usual approach is to increase the dose after four weeks by 2.5 mg (one tablet) to 5 mg per week at intervals no more frequent than every month, as indicated by disease activity and as tolerated (eg, from 10 mg initially to 15 mg once weekly after four weeks of initial therapy, then after a month on the higher dose it can be increased as tolerated to 17.5 or 20 mg once weekly if the response has been inadequate). In patients with continued high disease activity, we may increase by up to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> if few comorbidities are present and if the increase in the dose continues to be well-tolerated. The usual target dose is at least 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week;</span> the usual maximum dose is 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span>. Alternative dose titration strategies may also be employed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Dose titration'</a>.)</p><p>In early RA trials in which the dose of MTX is rapidly increased to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> and in which the drug is continued for at least three months, approximately 30 percent of patients achieve a Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) less than or equal to 3.2, consistent with low disease activity, within three to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>For patients in whom 15 to 25 mg of MTX orally once weekly is ineffective or is poorly tolerated because of gastrointestinal symptoms, a trial of subcutaneous MTX administration is an alternative to switching to another DMARD or to adding a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. As an alternative to subcutaneous dosing, MTX can be administered orally in a split dose, as MTX is better absorbed, particularly at high doses, if the dose is split into two doses on the day of administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. It is imperative to tell the patient to take all the MTX over a single 24-hour period once a week, as spreading the dose out further may produce significant liver toxicity.

The toxicities associated with MTX in the doses used in RA are very rarely life-threatening in patients receiving recommended monitoring. MTX is generally well-tolerated, although most patients experience at least one or more of the more common side effects, such as gastrointestinal upset or stomatitis, over their course of therapy. Although concomitant use of certain medicines (such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or proton pump inhibitors) can increase MTX drug levels, this typically has little clinical consequence given the relatively low weekly doses used in RA compared with the substantially higher doses used as the treatment of some cancers. MTX is discontinued due to adverse effects after two and five years of treatment in up to 20 and 35 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

One trial demonstrated similar efficacy of leflunomide to MTX with both being superior to placebo, and the second larger head-to-head study demonstrated that MTX was superior to leflunomide in the individual components of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) clinical response.

We would typically make a change in therapy in patients who continue to have high disease activity despite optimized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) dosing after three months, even if they have had some benefit. Patients with a substantial reduction in disease activity both proportionally (eg, over 50 percent) and in absolute terms (eg, reduction in a Disease Activity Score 28 [DAS28] of &gt;1.2) might have such changes deferred to six months, even if minimal disease activity has not yet been achieved, depending upon their goals and preferences.

In the minority of patients who achieve a sustained clinical remission of greater than one year, we cautiously try to reduce disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) doses while maintaining close monitoring to facilitate recognition of any recurrence of disease activity. Although some patients may tolerate a reduced dose of medications, whether or not to discontinue DMARDs in patients in remission remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/14,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,62</a>]. We prefer to continue nonbiologic or biologic DMARD therapy at reduced doses, if possible, but do not discontinue DMARD therapy in most patients who have had active RA. Cautious reduction of biologic DMARD doses can be performed by increasing the interval between doses or by reducing the medication dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In such a patient, we would lower the glucocorticoid dose slowly (no faster than an average of 1 mg every two to four weeks), as long as there was no recurrence of disease activity. If prednisone can be discontinued, or cannot but can be lowered to a dose no greater than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> we next decrease MTX. We reduce the MTX dose in 2.5 mg increments every two to three months as tolerated but generally to no lower than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span>. A lower dose of MTX (eg, 10 to 12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week)</span> may be adequate to maintain remission in patients who are older or who have diminished renal function.</p><p>Continued close monitoring is required in patients who discontinue their medications and who enter a period of possible drug-free remission. The risk of disease recurrence in such patients is high, and flares of disease may occur even several years after stopping therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/62-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-67</a>]. Additionally, clinical remission can be difficult to achieve upon resumption of DMARD therapy in patients who have discontinued all DMARDs. The best candidates for achieving a drug-free remission appear to be patients with the following characteristics: a short duration of symptoms when treatment is started, male sex, the absence of autoantibodies, and receipt of early intensive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/56,65,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,65,67,68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H366807650\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY, COMORBIDITIES, AND OTHER SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy and the presence of comorbidities, such as renal or hepatic disease, may affect medication choices and may influence the degree of risk inherent in attempting to reach a goal of remission or of low disease activity in a given patient.

Additional principles for the treatment of RA include achievement and maintenance of tight control of disease activity, with the ideal goal of remission; use of antiinflammatory agents, including glucocorticoids, only as adjunctive agents; and participation of a rheumatologist in the evaluation and ongoing care of the patient.

Doses are increased as tolerated and as needed, up to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week,</span> to control symptoms and signs of arthritis. Subcutaneous administration may be of benefit in patients with an inadequate response to orally administered MTX at a dose of 15 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> of MTX. (See <a href=\"#H3981583\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy with methotrexate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who are unable or unwilling to take MTX, we use an alternative nonbiologic or biologic DMARD therapy.

We use NSAIDs in all patients without contraindications to their use. In patients with more severe disease or with moderate disease resistant to a brief course of NSAIDs, we suggest the use of glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We then taper and withdraw these medications once DMARDs have taken effect. We use intraarticular injections of long-acting glucocorticoids to reduce synovitis in particular joints that are more inflamed than others. When clinically indicated, joint fluid should be obtained to exclude infection. (See <a href=\"#H3693478\" class=\"local\">'NSAIDs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3693989\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the initial treatment of patients with active RA, the patient should be reevaluated every three to five weeks for the effectiveness of therapy and for the monitoring of possible drug toxicity. We advise the periodic reevaluation of disease activity using a quantitative composite measure at each assessment. In patients who fail to achieve remission within three to six months of initiating therapy, or who require more than approximately 5 to 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or equivalent glucocorticoid on a chronic basis to maintain a state of remission or low disease activity, we suggest using a more potent DMARD or combination of DMARDs rather than continuing the same treatment regimen for a longer period of time (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
