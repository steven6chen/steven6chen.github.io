Pubic lice can be found in all parts of the world, affecting men and women of all races.</p><p>This article reviews the diagnosis and treatment of pubic lice. Head lice are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-lice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Head lice (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). More detailed information about pubic lice is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediculosis-pubis-and-pediculosis-ciliaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediculosis pubis and pediculosis ciliaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PUBIC LICE DESCRIPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pubic or crab louse is tiny and round. It can be difficult to see unless it is filled with blood from a recent feeding. It has crab-like claws that allow it to grasp tightly onto hair. Female lice lay up to 26 eggs (called nits) over a period of three to four weeks. The eggs hatch after about eight days.</p><p>Although these lice primarily affect the pubic area, they can also be found on other areas of the body (eyebrows, armpits, beard, mustache). Pubic lice usually are not found on the head. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-lice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Head lice (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Animals do not carry or spread pubic lice. However, pubic lice can move and spread from one person to another on clothing, bedsheets, towels, or other shared items.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PUBIC LICE SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people infested with pubic lice have itching in the pubic or genital area. Other parts of the body, such as the armpits, can also be itchy if lice are present. There might be pale bluish spots on the lower belly, upper thighs, or buttocks from repeat feedings in the same area.</p><p>Children of parents infested with pubic lice occasionally develop a lice infestation of the eyelashes or eyebrows. This can cause an itching or burning sensation in the eyes, and the eyelids might look red and irritated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PUBIC LICE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse can diagnose pubic lice by looking at the genital area for lice or their eggs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64225\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64225 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>If you are diagnosed with pubic lice, which is a sexually transmitted infection, you should be tested for other sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chlamydia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testing-for-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Testing for HIV (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PUBIC LICE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommended treatment for pubic lice is a lotion or cream that is applied to the skin. The most commonly used treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Permethrin (Nix, Rid)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pyrethrin (A-200, Pronto, Tisit)</p><p/><p>Before using the treatment, your skin should be cool and dry so that it will not absorb the medicine. You should apply the lotion or cream to the skin and hair in the pubic area and skin around the anus, but not inside the vagina or rectum. Other hairy areas, such as the underarms, chest, back, and thighs should also be treated. After 10 minutes, rinse the treatment off with water.</p><p>After treatment, you can remove any lice that you see with your fingernails, a fine-toothed comb, or tweezers. </p><p>Some people need a second treatment to get rid of public lice. Your doctor or nurse may ask you to return for an exam to see if any lice remain before doing a second treatment. Alternatively, your doctor or nurse may ask you to do a second treatment 9 to 10 days after your first treatment.</p><p>If you are diagnosed with pubic lice, you should tell anyone that you have had sex with during the previous month to get treated. You should not have sex again until you are both treated. You should wash any clothing, towels, and bedding used within three days before treatment in hot water and dry the items on the hottest setting. Dry cleaning is another option for cleaning clothing.</p><p>If there are items that cannot be washed or dry cleaned, you can place the item in a sealed plastic bag for two weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Eyelash involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eyelash infestation can occur in adolescents or adults who have pubic lice. The eyelashes can also become involved in children who are close contacts of adults with pubic lice. This condition may cause itching, burning, and eye irritation. Children with eyelash infestation may continually rub their eyes.</p><p>Children with an infestation of the eyelashes can be treated with petroleum jelly (ask a pharmacist to find petroleum jelly that is safe to use in the eyes as regular petroleum jelly may be irritating). You should apply the petroleum jelly to the eyelids twice a day for 8 to 10 days. The jelly will loosen the lice and nits so that you can pull them off with your fingers. In more severe cases, the child's doctor or nurse might recommend a prescription treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=2733\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
