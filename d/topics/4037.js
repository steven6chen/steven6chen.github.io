Primary systemic ALCL, as the name implies, presents as systemic, extracutaneous disease and may be ALK positive or ALK negative.

The exact worldwide incidence of ALCL is not known, as collection of these types of epidemiologic data is limited in some countries by a lack of resources that are needed for case ascertainment and accurate diagnosis. Epidemiologic data largely come from retrospective analyses of patients treated at major centers in the United States, Europe, and Asia.</p><p>ALCL accounts for approximately 2 percent of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is the second or third most common T cell lymphoma histology in adults depending on the series analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In the United States as a whole, ALCL has an estimated incidence of 0.25 cases per 100,000 people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. ALCL is less common in Asian Americans than among White Americans, Black Americans, American Indians, or Asian Pacific Islanders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. ALCL has a bimodal age of incidence with a peak in the pre-teen and adolescent years and a second peak around the age of 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. ALCL occurring in older adults is usually ALK negative. There is a male predominance, especially in ALK-positive ALCL in young patients that can have a male:female ratio as high as 3:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The largest retrospective study was the International T cell Lymphoma Project, which assessed 1314 cases of peripheral lymphoma of T cell or NK cell origin from 22 centers worldwide diagnosed between 1990 and 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Approximately 6.6 and 5.5 percent were classified as ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL, respectively. The percentage of persons with ALCL varied with geographic region. ALCL was the most common distinct subtype of PTCL in the United States, accounting for 24 percent of cases. In contrast, ALCL accounted for approximately 16 and 6 percent of PTCLs in Europe and Asia, respectively. </p><p>Initial reports suggested that Epstein-Barr virus may be important in the development of the disease, but this has been subsequently refuted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), however, does remain a risk factor particularly for ALK-negative ALCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL have similar gene expression signatures that differ from other subtypes of PTCL, suggesting that the molecular lesions that drive these two subtypes converge to dysregulate a common core set of genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2139523320\"><span class=\"h2\">ALK expression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, ALK-positive ALCLs have a rearrangement involving the <strong>A</strong>naplastic <strong>L</strong>ymphoma <strong>K</strong>inase gene (<em>ALK</em>), which results in the formation of <em>ALK</em> fusion genes that are implicated in its pathogenesis. There are multiple chromosomal rearrangements involving <em>ALK</em> that create <em>ALK</em> fusion genes that encode chimeric, constitutively active ALK kinases. The best described and most frequent translocation, t(2;5), causes the fusion of the nucleophosmin (<em>NPM</em>) gene (5q35), coding for a nucleolar phosphoprotein, with the portion <em>ALK</em> on chromosome 2p23 that encodes the ALK cytoplasmic domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Consequently, a hybrid protein is formed in which the amino terminus of <em>NPM</em> is fused with the catalytic domain of <em>ALK</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The translocation product, <em>NPM-ALK</em>, then acts as a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, which can trigger malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and activate antiapoptotic pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/11,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13-15</a>].</p><p>In vitro and mouse model studies have demonstrated that expression of human <em>NPM-ALK</em> induces lymphoproliferative disorders of both B and T cell lineage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>]. The ability of <em>NPM-ALK</em> to cause both B and T cell tumors in mice is in line with the occurrence of rare human plasmablastic B cell lymphomas with <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangements.</p><p>In addition to fusion with <em>NPM</em>, <em>ALK</em> participates in a number of variant rearrangements, each of which presumably gives rise to a constitutively active ALK fusion protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Each of these diverse fusion proteins is believed to have identical functional consequences: fusion of the ALK tyrosine kinase domain to a protein domain with the capacity for self-association, which appears to be the key element that leads to constitutive activation of the ALK tyrosine kinase moiety. It remains to be seen whether ALK-positive lymphomas with variant <em>ALK</em> rearrangements (eg, inv20, t(1;2), and t(2;3)) have an identical biology and clinical behavior to the more common tumors associated with the t(2;5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].

The <em>DUSP22-IRF4</em> rearrangement is not associated with altered expression of the <em>IRF4</em> gene and is distinct from rare <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IRF4/TRA</em></span> rearrangements in CD30-negative PTCL, not otherwise specified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, knockdown of IRF4 by RNA interference is toxic to ALCL cell lines in vitro and in ALCL xenograft mouse models in vivo. IRF4 may act through MYC, as gene expression profiling after IRF4 knockdown has shown significant downregulation of known MYC target genes, and knockdown of MYC and pharmacologic inhibition of MYC signaling are both toxic to ALCL cell lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Cells harboring t(6;7)(p25.3;q32.3) may have morphologic differences from other ALK-negative ALCLs and typically have sheets of hallmark cells admixed with &quot;doughnut&quot; cells and few large pleomorphic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The same group that identified these genetic and morphologic features used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in frozen tissue and RNA in situ hybridization in paraffin tissue to demonstrate higher CCR8 expression in ALCLs with <em>DUSP22</em> rearrangements than in non-rearranged cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The cytotoxic markers TIA-1 and granzyme B were generally absent in <em>DUSP22</em>-rearranged ALCL (being present in only 10 and 5 percent of cases, respectively), and they were much more commonly expressed in other cases of ALCL. Although the absence of TIA-1 and granzyme B imparted a favorable prognosis, a <em>DUSP22</em> rearrangement imparted a favorable prognosis independent of the expression of these two molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1051650028\"><span class=\"h2\">Other genetic aberrations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL have a gene expression signature similar to each other but different from other subtypes of PTCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

On histology, the tumor is usually composed of large cells, often with horseshoe-shaped nuclei (so-called &quot;hallmark&quot; cells), prominent nucleoli, with or without a paranuclear hof. The tumor cells often grow in cohesive-appearing sheets and sometimes cluster within lymph node sinuses, appearances that can mimic metastatic solid tumors such as carcinoma. In the small cell variant, tumor cells have similar nuclear features but are substantially smaller in size and may be found mainly around blood vessels. In the monomorphic variant, the characteristic &quot;hallmark&quot; cells may be relatively few in number. On immunohistochemistry, there is a homogeneous and strong expression of CD30 in a membrane and Golgi pattern. There is also expression of T cell antigens or no lineage-specific antigens in the case of the null cell type. Systemic ALCL is further subclassified based upon the presence or absence of ALK. <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangement can be inferred by immunostaining for ALK or detected directly using molecular genetics or cytogenetics and by definition must be present in ALK-positive ALCL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of ALK-positive ALCL includes other lymphoid neoplasms of T or null cell origin and some B cell neoplasms, such as the anaplastic type of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma, which may have similar morphologic features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86090\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86090 \">table 2</a>).

In adults, the tumor is clinically aggressive but potentially curable, having an overall survival similar to that of diffuse large B cell lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5,55,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,55,70,71</a>].</p><p>The International Peripheral T cell Lymphoma Project, described above, reported estimated five-year overall survival rates for patients with ALK-positive ALCL of 90, 68, 23, and 33 percent for patients with an IPI of 0 or 1, 2, 3, and 4 or 5, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Corresponding estimates of five-year survival in patients with ALK-negative ALCL were 74, 62, 31, and 13 percent, respectively. Poor performance status, high stage, and elevated LDH were also predictive of lower survival in patients with ALCL. In addition, increased age, multiple extranodal sites, and anemia were poor prognostic factors in ALK-positive, but not ALK-negative, ALCL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a lymphoid neoplasm of T or null cell origin and one of the most common forms of peripheral T cell lymphoma. Two subtypes of ALCL are recognized by the World Health Organization classification system: ALK-positive ALCL and ALK-negative ALCL. ALK-positive ALCL is associated with translocations involving <em>ALK</em>, the <strong>A</strong>naplastic <strong>L</strong>ymphoma <strong>K</strong>inase gene, located on chromosome 2p23. ALCL is a lymphoma most commonly seen in children and young adults, and it has a male predominance. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with ALCL present with painless adenopathy and are found to have widespread disease on staging. B symptoms are not uncommon. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On lymph node biopsy, the tumor is composed of large cells with horseshoe-shaped nuclei, prominent nucleoli, with or without a paranuclear hof, growing in a cohesive growth pattern. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrates a strong and homogeneous CD30 expression in a membrane and Golgi pattern. There is also expression of T cell antigens or no lineage-specific antigens as in the case of the null cell type. The presence of an <em>ALK</em> rearrangement can be inferred by immunostaining for ALK (indirectly) or detected directly by molecular genetics or cytogenetics. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ALCL is based on the pathologic features of lymph node or skin biopsy in combination with a clinical evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of ALCL includes other lymphoid neoplasms of T or null cell origin and some B cell neoplasms, which may have similar morphologic features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86090\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86090 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ALCL often pursues a clinically aggressive course. ALK-positive ALCL is more responsive to therapy and associated with a better prognosis than ALK-negative ALCL. The most important additional prognostic factor is the patient's International Prognostic Index (IPI). (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Morton LM, Wang SS, Devesa SS, et al.
