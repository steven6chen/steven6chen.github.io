The phenomenon is manifested clinically by sharply demarcated color changes of the skin of the digits. Abnormal vasoconstriction of digital arteries and cutaneous arterioles due to a local defect in normal vascular responses is thought to underlie the disorder.</p><p>RP is considered primary if these symptoms occur alone without evidence of any associated disorder. By comparison, secondary RP refers to the presence of the disorder in association with a related illness, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma).</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the Raynaud phenomenon are reviewed here. The pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon-resistant-to-initial-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the Raynaud phenomenon resistant to initial therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Establishing the true prevalence of Raynaud phenomenon (RP) is hampered by the lack of a well-defined reproducible &quot;gold standard&quot; diagnostic test. Cold hands and feet are a normal physiological response to cold exposure that, to preserve heat, cools the surface skin and causes skin color changes; whereas RP is an exaggerated vascular response to cold temperature or emotional stress. Although survey criteria vary, most investigators agree that a history of at least two color changes (pallor and cyanosis) after cold exposure is necessary for a definite diagnosis.</p><p>Community-based surveys have been performed to estimate the prevalence of RP in the general population. In these surveys, estimates of the prevalence of RP have ranged from 3 to 20 percent in women and 3 to 14 percent in men.</p><p>These relatively wide ranges reflect, in part, the populations that are studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/1-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RP is more common in France (17 percent) than in the United States (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A survey performed by the author in an African-American community found a prevalence of 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As reported in a community survey of 1525 participants, the prevalence of primary RP was approximately 11 and 9 percent in women and men, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>RP is more common among young women, younger age groups, and family members of patients with RP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. RP often starts early in life, but the prevalence then appears to remain relatively constant throughout life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A review found a 0.1 to 1 percent prevalence of new-onset RP among individuals over the age of 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Additionally, the prevalence of RP found in a given population is influenced by the climate of the region studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25285296\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY AND SECONDARY RAYNAUD PHENOMENON</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Raynaud phenomenon (RP) are described as having either a primary or secondary process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113300484\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary Raynaud phenomenon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary RP or idiopathic Raynaud disease are terms to describe those patients without a definable cause for their vascular events. In this setting, RP is considered to be an exaggeration of normal vasoconstriction to cold exposure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a>). Most investigators feel the term &quot;disease&quot; is inappropriate and prefer using the term primary RP for otherwise healthy individuals.</p><p>Primary RP usually has an age of onset between 15 and 30 years of age, is more common in women, and may occur in multiple family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Studies of RP in children are limited, but, while primary RP often begins in the teenage years, careful assessment for secondary causes is most important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/9,10,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,15,16</a>]. Although patients with primary RP are generally otherwise healthy, comorbid conditions can occur that may aggravate attacks. These include hypertension, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus.</p><p>There are conditions that are associated with RP, but it is unclear if they are pathologically linked, as is seen in various causes of secondary RP. There is a reported increase in prevalence of RP among patients with fibromyalgia syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. These surveys may have included subjects with secondary disease states. One survey found no association between skin temperature and digital color changes in patients with fibromyalgia, suggesting a unique cause for RP in fibromyalgia compared with patients with primary RP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Similarly, there are several surveys that support an association of migraine headaches and RP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. However, it is not established that RP and the migraine headache share a common cause or mechanism of vascular dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113300498\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary Raynaud phenomenon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary RP refers to those patients with RP in whom an associated disease or cause may underlie the attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Other investigators prefer the term Raynaud syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Since a variety of possible insults can disrupt the normal complex regulation of regional blood flow to the digits and skin, the number of diseases and exposures associated with secondary RP is extensive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77253\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77253 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases commonly associated with RP include autoimmune rheumatic diseases such as systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome and <span class=\"nowrap\">dermatomyositis/polymyositis</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various drugs or toxins can also precipitate or exacerbate RP such as amphetamines and chemotherapeutic agents (especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematologic abnormalities associated with RP include cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin disease, paraproteinemia, POEMS (<strong>P</strong>olyneuropathy, <strong>O</strong>rganomegaly, <strong>E</strong>ndocrinopathy, <strong>M</strong>onoclonal gammopathy, and <strong>S</strong>kin changes) syndrome, and cryofibrinogenemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occupational and environmental causes of RP include vascular trauma (eg, injury to the distal ulnar artery in the hypothenar hammer syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>], the use of vibrating tools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>], frostbite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], and carpal tunnel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothyroidism may predispose to RP, and improvement of cold induced vasospasm may occur with thyroid hormone replacement. Vasculitis may cause ischemic digits, but the absence of preceding cold-induced and reversible color changes help distinguish this from true RP.</p><p/><p>Since primary RP is common in the general population, some reported associations of RP have not been proven. As an example, the prevalence of RP in rheumatoid arthritis is controversial. Some surveys suggest no increase in risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>], but other studies have found that 17 to 22 percent of patients with rheumatoid arthritis had RP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Those with RP were more likely to have vasculitis or severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p>The reported frequencies and rates of development of a disease or disorder to which RP is secondary among patients initially thought to have primary RP vary. A meta-analysis of 10 articles including approximately 640 patients diagnosed with primary RP found that 81 (13 percent) patients eventually developed an autoimmune rheumatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In a longitudinal study including 307 patients with RP, the annual incidence of transition from presumed primary RP to secondary RP was 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Other large cohorts of patients with an initial presentation suggesting primary RP reported that between 16 and 37 percent transition to secondary RP during the follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both primary and secondary Raynaud phenomenon (RP) most often affect the hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>]. Attacks also frequently occur in the toes, but patients are less likely to complain of lower extremity symptoms.</p><p>With both primary and secondary RP, a typical episode is characterized by the sudden onset of cold fingers (or toes) in association with sharply demarcated color changes of skin pallor (white attack) due to constricted blood flow, followed by cyanotic skin (blue attack) which indicates tissue hypoxia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66438\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66438 \">picture 1</a>). With rewarming, the ischemic phase (white or blue attack) usually lasts for 15 to 20 minutes. The skin subsequently blushes upon recovery, thereby resulting in the erythema of reperfusion.</p><p>A Raynaud attack typically begins in a single finger and then spreads to other digits symmetrically in both hands. The index, middle, and ring finger are the most frequently involved digits, while the thumb is often spared entirely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Involvement of the thumb may indicate a secondary cause of RP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Cutaneous vasospasm is also common at other sites, including the skin of the ears, nose, face, knees, and nipples. A common pathophysiologic feature of affected areas is the presence of thermoregulatory vessels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning#H86655702\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common problems of breastfeeding and weaning&quot;, section on 'Nipple vasoconstriction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms of low blood flow and ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of RP may include complaints resulting from low blood flow or ischemia. As an example, mild RP may be associated with sensations of pins and needles, numbness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clumsiness of the hand, and finger aching. The signs of mild RP should be completely reversible on rewarming or reduction of stress. Less severe disease is most commonly observed in those with primary RP.</p><p>Mild to severe symptoms and signs of ischemia can be observed in patients with secondary RP. In severe secondary RP, for example, pain or ulceration of the skin (typically the tips of the fingers and toes) may result from critical tissue ischemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Livedo reticularis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During a cold response, patients with RP may exhibit livedo reticularis; this is a violaceous mottling or reticular pattern of the skin of the arms and legs, sometimes with regular unbroken circles. In those with primary RP, this finding is benign and completely reversible with rewarming.</p><p>By comparison, nonreversible livedo reticularis may be observed in patients with vasculitis, occlusive vascular disease (eg, due to atheroemboli or thrombosis), or antiphospholipid syndrome. These cutaneous changes may also be associated with irregular broken circles. Due to these differences, some experts advocate use of the term &quot;livedo racemosa&quot; rather than &quot;livedo reticularis&quot; for these cutaneous findings in patients with inflammatory or thrombotic vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Provoking factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with both primary and secondary RP note that exposure to cold temperature triggers RP. More importantly, the provocation occurs during relative shifts from warmer to cooler temperatures. As a result, mild cold exposures such as air conditioning or the cold of the refrigerated food section of the grocery store may cause an attack. Although attacks occur locally in the fingers, a general body chill will also trigger an episode, even if the hands or feet areas are kept warm. To avoid RP, therefore, patients must maintain whole body warmth.</p><p>An attack of RP may also occur after stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (such as emotional stress, sudden startling). It is not uncommon for the clinician to witness a typical attack during the first encounter with a frightened or nervous patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113300558\"><span class=\"h2\">Course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous remission of primary RP may occur. This was illustrated in a prospective study that surveyed a middle-aged white population over a seven-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. For those who had, or who developed, primary RP during that time frame, remissions occurred in 64 percent of both women and men. However, some symptoms suggestive of RP continued in about 20 percent of the cases that were classified as a &quot;remission.&quot;</p><p>By comparison, remission is uncommon in patients with secondary RP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150103612\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS OF RAYNAUD PHENOMENON</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to the evaluation and diagnosis of Raynaud phenomenon (RP) is summarized in an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F94303\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94303 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Our evaluation begins with the following three screening questions for RP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/46,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,49</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are your fingers unusually sensitive to cold?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do your fingers change color when they are exposed to cold temperatures?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do your fingers turn white, blue, or both?</p><p/><p>We diagnose RP if the patient has a positive response to all three questions.

Among such patients, there is typically no need for further specialized testing. However, we recognize that serological testing such as antinuclear antibody (ANA) is often done in this clinical setting. A weakly positive ANA <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;1/640)</span> is common in the general population; therefore, a positive test must be interpreted in the context of the entire clinical situation.

Most studies find that a transition to a defined secondary autoimmune rheumatic disease usually occurs within two to three years of presentation with RP. Among those initially diagnosed with primary RP, the presence of autoantibodies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormalities of nailfold capillary microscopy may help predict of the development of secondary RP.

Upon initial examination, 30 and 18 of these patients were considered to have primary RP and possible autoimmune rheumatic disease (defined as one suggestive symptom), respectively. Patients were subsequently examined every two years, with blood drawn and the sera stored. Among these individuals, the presence of an ANA was significantly associated with the eventual development of an autoimmune rheumatic disorder over the six-year follow-up period. In addition, the prognostic value of a positive anticentromere antibody was 60 percent sensitive and 98 percent specific for the development of the CREST syndrome (<strong>C</strong>alcinosis cutis, <strong>R</strong>aynaud phenomenon, <strong>E</strong>sophageal dysmotility, <strong>S</strong>clerodactyly, and <strong>T</strong>elangiectasia) or limited skin variant of scleroderma, and a positive anti-Scl-70 antibody was 38 and 100 percent sensitive and specific, respectively, for the development of SSc or probable SSc.

In one study, 10 percent of those surveyed had cold sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. This common complaint of cold hands and feet may be a family trait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Cold sensitivity and decreased skin blood flow following cold exposure occurs more commonly in women and in the older population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External compression of blood vessels &ndash; External compression of blood vessels (eg, carrying a heavy parcel) can cause a transient decrease in blood flow, and, as a consequence, a hand and fingers can be temporally numb, pale, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cold. Unlike RP, this is not induced by cold or stress and is easily reversed once blood flow is restored.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral neuropathy &ndash; Peripheral neuropathy can cause cold intolerance with numbness and skin color changes in the hands and feet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. However, unlike those with RP, patients with peripheral neuropathy may also have distal loss of sensation to pin prick, light touch, cold, and proprioception.

Although patients with CRPS may have vasomotor disturbances that can produce altered color and temperature, this is typically followed by muscle wasting which is not observed in primary RP, and the pain is usually continuous (in RP pain is intermittent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occlusive vascular disease &ndash; Occlusive vascular disease (eg, emboli, thrombosis, atherosclerosis, thromboangiitis obliterans) either can cause a cold limb, hand, foot, or digit or can be associated tissue ischemia with secondary vasospasm. Unlike typical RP, symptoms related to occlusive vascular disease are typically asymmetric and often limited to a single digit; vasospasm may be irreversible with critical tissue ischemia; vascular studies may be necessary to identify an occlusive lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acrocyanosis &ndash; Acrocyanosis is a functional peripheral vascular disorder characterized by symmetrical painless and persistent blue discoloration of the hands or feet, which is often aggravated by cold exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Acrocyanosis can be differentiated from RP by the relative persistence of skin color changes, symmetry, and absence of paroxysmal pallor. As with RP, acrocyanosis is aggravated by cold exposure; however, it is also often associated with hyperhidrosis of hands and feet. RP attacks superimposed on acrocyanosis are not uncommon, and it may be difficult to distinguish the two disorders. Unlike RP, acrocyanosis rarely responds to vasodilator therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute idiopathic blue finger &ndash; Acute idiopathic blue finger, also known as Achenbach syndrome or paroxysmal finger hematoma, is a rarely reported clinical disorder in which patients present with sudden onset of painful swelling of at least one digit, with an ecchymosis-like discoloration developing on the volar aspect of the finger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/85-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-87</a>]. The blue discoloration usually spares the distal segment of the finger. The clinical course is benign, and symptoms typically resolve without lasting sequelae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythromelalgia &ndash; Erythromelalgia (EM) is an exaggerated blushing of the skin that can mimic the recovery phase or hyperemic phase of RP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. In contrast to RP, the vasodilatation associated with EM is triggered by warm temperature and is improved with cold exposure.

With rewarming, the ischemic phase (white or blue attack) usually lasts for 15 to 20 minutes. The skin subsequently blushes upon recovery, thereby resulting in the erythema of reperfusion.
