It remains a diagnostic challenge for clinicians, but prompt recognition is important so that supportive therapy can be instituted early.</p><p>The pathogenesis and etiology, clinical presentation and diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and outcomes of FES are reviewed here. Other embolism syndromes are discussed separately.

The term fat embolism syndrome (FES) refers to the clinical syndrome that follows an identifiable insult which releases fat into the circulation, resulting in pulmonary and systemic symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H5336128\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and etiology'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5337817\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5336128\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a rare clinical syndrome that can complicate a wide variety of clinical conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71678\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71678 \">table 1</a>), particularly those where fat is manipulated. Almost all cases of FES are due to long bone and pelvic fractures (bone marrow contains a high content of fat). However, some cases are associated with trauma in the absence of orthopedic fractures and rare cases are nontrauma-related. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H503704976\"><span class=\"h2\">Orthopedic fractures or trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rates of FES in orthopedic trauma patients varies from &lt;1 percent to &gt;30 percent, the wide range likely reflecting study population heterogeneity and a lack of standardization for diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>FES is most commonly associated with long bone (especially the femur) and pelvic fractures and less commonly with fractures of other marrow-containing bones (eg, ribs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71678\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71678 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>].The rate of FES is also higher in those with multiple fractures (1.29 versus 0.17 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. It is more frequent in closed fractures than open fractures.</p><p>FES is more common in men than in women and its incidence is highest in those between 10 and 40 years, likely reflecting the incidence of trauma in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>Although rare, surgical trauma during orthopedic procedures such as total hip or knee arthroplasty (ie, bone marrow needs to be manipulated for hardware placement), intraosseous access or infusions, and bone marrow harvesting and transplant can also result in FES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H594832888\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonorthopedic trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other trauma-related injury that can be associated with FES include soft tissue injury, particularly injury to adipose tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71678\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71678 \">table 1</a>). Rarely, fat embolism can be seen with burns, liposuction, lipoinjection, fat grafting, panniculitis, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (without rib fracture, some of which may relate to intraosseous access) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Rare cases following nonorthopedic surgery (eg, cardiopulmonary bypass, cesarian section), and donor-related FES after lung transplantation, have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345994512\"><span class=\"h2\">Nontrauma-related</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rare case reports describe nontrauma-related causes of FES including pancreatitis, sickle or thalassemia-related hemoglobinopathies (especially during a crisis), osteonecrosis, bone marrow necrosis, lipid-based infusions or contrast agents, intramuscular injections of oil for cosmetic purposes, fatty liver disease, renal angiomyolipoma invasion of the inferior vena cava, and others listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71678\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71678 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/6,11,14-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,14-27</a>]. Although autopsy data in nontrauma populations report that 63 percent have FES, it is likely that this is an overestimate or represents subclinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of fat embolism is unknown. There are two theories: the mechanical theory where fat emboli may be the result of fat globules entering the bloodstream through tissue (usually bone marrow or adipose tissue) that has been disrupted by trauma, and the biochemical theory where inflammation results from the production of toxic intermediaries of circulating fat (eg, chylomicrons, infused lipids, or bone marrow-derived fat). It is feasible that both mechanisms are at play in many cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical theory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This theory proposes that fat from disrupted bone marrow or adipose tissue enters torn venules following trauma. It is supported by the observation that fractures of marrow-containing bone have the highest incidence of fat embolism syndrome (FES) and cause the largest volume of fat emboli because the disrupted venules in the marrow are tethered open by their osseous attachments, allowing the marrow contents to easily enter the venous circulation. The hypothesis is also supported by the observation that &quot;echogenic material&quot; passes through the right heart during orthopedic and spinal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p>Fat embolism sufficiently explains the respiratory symptoms of FES since fat globules collect and obstruct pulmonary arterial capillaries. In addition, it is thought that circulating fat cells may have prothrombotic potential and may trigger the aggregation of platelets and fibrin resulting in further obstruction of pulmonary capillary venules, local inflammation, hemorrhage, and edema. When massive, this process may lead to right ventricle failure and obstructive shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults#H104104293\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Obstructive'</a>.)</p><p>Fat emboli may enter the systemic arterial circulation to result in neurologic disease and petechiae associated with FES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] via one of two mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paradoxical embolism &ndash; Paradoxical embolism occurs when material passes through a patent foramen ovale or other anatomical shunt and into the arterial circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microembolism &ndash; Microembolism occurs when the emboli are so small that they are able to pass from the pulmonary arterial to pulmonary venous circulation through the lungs and eventually to the left side of the heart. This mechanism is supported by the finding of embolized material in the systemic circulation in the absence of a patent foramen ovale. </p><p/><p>There are several limitations to the mechanical fat embolism theory: it does not sufficiently explain the 24 to 72 hour interval following the acute insult during which the patient is symptom-free and it does not explain nontraumatic FES.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Biochemical theory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Production of toxic intermediaries of circulating fat is an alternative theory about the mechanism of FES, which may occur instead of or in addition to the mechanical mechanism described above. This theory is based upon the hypothesis that embolized fat degrades into toxic intermediaries with pro-inflammatory effects and is supported by elevated levels of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free fatty acids &ndash; Circulating free fatty acid levels are moderately elevated in patients with fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>] and severely elevated (along with circulating lipoprotein lipase) in nontraumatic animal models of FES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Animal studies have found that neutral fat does not injure the lung; however, if it is hydrolyzed over the course of hours to several products, including free fatty acids, it may cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Free fatty acids have been associated with cardiac contractile dysfunction, which may be a feature of FES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytokines &ndash; Patients with FES also have been shown to have high levels of phospholipase A2 and inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C-reactive protein &ndash; C-reactive protein is elevated in patients with FES and appears to be responsible for lipid agglutination, with may obstruct blood flow in the microvasculature. Serum from acutely ill patients has been shown to agglutinate chylomicrons, low density lipoproteins, and the liposomes of nutritional fat emulsions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p>The production of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators may explain the classic 24 to 72 hour delay from the inciting event to clinically apparent FES. In other words, the onset of symptoms may coincide with the degradation and agglutination of fat. Toxic intermediaries also offer an explanation for nontraumatic FES, although the evidence is largely circumstantial. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5337817\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fat embolism syndrome (FES) typically manifests 24 to 72 hours after the initial insult, but may rarely occur as early as 12 hours or as late as two weeks after the inciting event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Affected patients develop a classic triad: hypoxemia, neurologic abnormalities, and a petechial rash.

In one series, hypoxemia was present in 96 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A syndrome indistinguishable from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may develop. Approximately one-half of patients with FES caused by long bone fractures develop severe hypoxemia and require mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The suspicion should be further increased when neurologic abnormalities and a petechial rash that emerges 24 to 72 hours after an insult (eg, long bone fracture) are present. (See <a href=\"#H1648156544\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p>When suspected, chest imaging, typically chest radiography <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computed tomography (CT), should be performed. CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain should be performed in those with neurologic symptoms. Routine laboratory studies should be drawn including complete blood count and coagulation studies. Measuring free fatty acid or c-reactive protein levels and examining urine or sputum for the presence of fat are not routinely performed since their diagnostic utility is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H2907862044\" class=\"local\">'Imaging and laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p>CT pulmonary angiography is not routinely performed for diagnosis but may help exclude pulmonary thromboembolism as an etiology for hypoxemia. Similarly, microbiology studies and echocardiography may help to rule out competing diagnoses such as pneumonia and heart failure. </p><p>Since most experts consider FES a clinical diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], further testing is not usually performed. In most cases, this noninvasive approach is considered appropriate since the only therapy that is available for FES is supportive. (See <a href=\"#H264960888\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3403940981\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic invasive testing is <strong>not</strong> routinely performed in most patients with suspected FES since there are no definitive therapies for FES and the diagnosis is typically a clinical one. Invasive procedures are usually only performed when a competing diagnosis is suspected, for which available therapies could alter the prognosis. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary artery catheter</strong> &ndash; A pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is not routinely placed for fat analysis from a wedged sample of pulmonary arterial blood since this is neither a sensitive nor specific way to diagnose FES. However, rarely, a sample may be drawn for fat assessment when a PAC is already in place for an alternate reason (eg, shock, pulmonary hypertension). When performed, the clinician should be aware that set diagnostic criteria for fat analysis are not known and the absence of fat does not preclude the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bronchoscopy</strong> &ndash; Similarly, bronchoscopy is not routinely performed. There is some evidence that suggests bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can detect fat droplets within alveolar macrophages, as a means of diagnosing fat embolism, but their absence does not rule out FES. Studies done in patients with trauma or the acute chest syndrome of sickle cell disease suggest that BAL may be useful; however, diagnostic criteria vary and lack standardization, and the sensitivity and specificity are unknown (eg, similar findings can be found in lipid aspiration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/15,61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,61-64</a>]. In one study of trauma patients, the presence of FES was associated with a high percentage of alveolar macrophages that contain lipid inclusion bodies (&gt;30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]; however, some patients with nontrauma-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) also had levels within this range. Thus, we only typically perform lipid analysis in BAL when attempting to concurrently elucidate other etiologies of respiratory failure (eg, infections, tumor).

However, fat globules may be found histologically as an incidental finding when tissue biopsy is performed for an alternate reason (eg, tumor embolism).

The appropriate clinical context of long bone fractures and the appearance of a petechial rash in a patient with hypoxemia and neurologic abnormalities strongly favors a diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome (FES); however not every patient presents in this classic fashion such that other conditions need to be considered or ruled out before a diagnosis can be made.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary embolism (PE) &ndash; Patients with PE may present in the same time frame (ie, 24 to 72 hours), but neurologic abnormalities and rash are less common and most cases will be distinguished by computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA).

However, since the presenting manifestations are nonspecific and the rash occurs in fewer than half of cases, the diagnosis of FES is more commonly made when clinical manifestations (eg, hypoxemia plus neurologic impairment) occur in the appropriate clinical setting and no alternative explanation exists (ie, a diagnosis of exclusion). Several diagnostic criteria, such as Gurd's, Schonfeld's, and Lindeque, have been proposed but none has been validated or compared and in general, they are not widely used in practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/16,60,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,60,65</a>]. </p><p>When tissue is obtained for other reasons or at autopsy, fat globules can be histologically appreciated by areas of optical clearing and after staining with Oil Red O, and when present may confirm the clinical suspicion for FES. Interestingly, since cases are diagnosed clinically, there are no clinicopathologic correlation studies. However, fat can be seen incidentally, and in patients without the full syndrome, so the clinical significance of fat on histology is uncertain. The presence of a high percentage of alveolar macrophages on bronchoalveolar lavage or high amounts of fat on a wedged pulmonary artery sample may be supportive of the diagnosis but is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of FES. (See <a href=\"#H3403940981\" class=\"local\">'Invasive testing'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no definitive treatments for fat embolism syndrome (FES).

This involves fluid resuscitation, oxygenation, and when indicated, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. Rarely, patients require intracranial pressure monitoring for massive cerebral involvement, or vasopressors, mechanical cardiac support devices, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/53,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,66,67</a>]. Supportive therapy is continued until FES resolves or death occurs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The administration of systemic corticosteroids is controversial. The rationale for the administration of steroids is based upon their anti-inflammatory effects (ie, targeted at one mechanism involved in the pathogenesis (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Biochemical theory'</a> above)) as well as evidence that supports their role in preventing FES (see <a href=\"#H2248987595\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below). However, most experts do not administer steroids routinely since data report unconvincing benefit in association with a wide range of doses and are limited to case <span class=\"nowrap\">reports/series</span> only; in addition, some suggest harm associated with the increased risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. Rarely, for those patients with life-threatening cases of FES, a limited trial (eg, 1 to 5 days) of systemic corticosteroids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 100 mg three time daily intravenously or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> is appropriate. Its administration should be weighed against the increased risk of steroid-associated infections. </p><p>The routine administration of heparin is not advised, although it has been proposed as an agent that may increase the clearance of intravascular lipids. However, the risk of hemorrhage, lack of trials demonstrating benefit and theoretical harm from an increase in free fatty acid production preclude its administration in the absence of a true indication for anticoagulation (eg, venous thromboembolism). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5336167\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with fat embolism syndrome (FES) fully recover spontaneously.

Individual studies have reported mortality rates ranging from 5 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/3,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,72</a>]. However, the true mortality is probably lower, as suggested by a meta-analysis that reported only two deaths among the 166 patients with FES who received supportive care alone (1.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

In a related clinical trial, 40 patients undergoing cemented total hip arthroplasty were randomly assigned to undergo the conventional procedure either with or without the placement of a venting hole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The purpose of the venting hole was to drain the medullary cavity between the greater and the lesser trochanter to limit intraoperative rises in intraosseous pressure. The group in which venting holes had been placed had significantly fewer major embolic events (20 versus 85 percent) as determined by transesophageal echocardiography and clinical monitoring. Other operative refinements may also limit intraosseous pressure, including cementless fixation of hip prostheses and unreamed intramedullary femoral shaft stabilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31156214\"><span class=\"h3\">Prophylactic corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of <strong>prophylactic</strong> corticosteroids is controversial and their administration should only be considered on a case-by-case basis and always weigh the potential benefits of preventing FES against the risk associated with their administration. </p><p>Although small randomized trials suggest possible benefit, many surgeons do not use them. This is because most experts consider that FES is too infrequent to justify the routine use of corticosteroids with their associated adverse effects, and that when FES does occur, most patients recover with supportive care alone. In addition, studies that suggested benefit were fundamentally flawed (heterogenous population, small size, inadequately controlled, variable dose and duration), casting doubt over whether or not corticosteroids are associated with a true benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/16,65,73,80-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,65,73,80-83</a>]. As an example, in a 2009 meta-analysis of six randomized trials, although corticosteroids resulted in a reduced incidence of FES (relative risk [RR] 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.57) and hypoxemia (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21-0.71), mortality was not decreased. Another 2012 meta-analysis of seven trials reported similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. However, in addition to the fundamental flaws in design, most of the trials did not report how many of the long-bone fractures were open or closed, nor did they report the mean duration of fractures until the initial dose of corticosteroids. Thus, a multicenter trial is needed before any definitive conclusion can be drawn regarding the routine administration of corticosteroids in this population.</p><p>Although inhaled corticosteroids was shown in one prospective study to reduce the incidence of FES in patients with skeletal injury, further studies are required before such therapy can be routinely administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fat-embolism-syndrome/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5336371\"><span class=\"h1\">SILICONE EMBOLISM SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A presentation similar to FES can result following the embolization of silicone to the pulmonary vasculature.

FES is most commonly associated with long bone (especially femur) and pelvic fractures. Some cases are associated with trauma in the absence of orthopedic fractures or are nontrauma-related (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71678\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71678 \">table 1</a>).

The classic triad of findings includes hypoxemia, neurologic abnormalities, and a petechial rash. Less common manifestations include anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, lipiduria, and coagulation abnormalities; myocardial depression and shock are rare. None of these features are specific for FES.

CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain should be performed in those with neurologic symptoms. Routine laboratory studies should be drawn including complete blood count and coagulation studies. Measuring free fatty acid or c-reactive protein levels, examining urine or sputum for the presence of fat, and invasive procedures including fat analysis from a wedged sample aspirated from a pulmonary artery catheter, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or tissue biopsy are not routinely performed since their diagnostic utility is unclear.
