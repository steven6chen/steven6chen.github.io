In addition to physical symptoms due to tumors, the psychosocial burden associated with KS may be profound and includes emotional distress, guilt, and anger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The staging and treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma are discussed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432035701\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING AND EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432035415\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly utilized staging system for AIDS-related KS was developed by the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) of the National Institute of Health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This system divides patients into good or poor risk prognostic categories, taking into account both the KS and HIV infection.</p><p>Patients are categorized according to three parameters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54626\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54626 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extent of tumor (T): a favorable prognosis (T0) is associated with disease limited to the skin or with minimal involvement of the oral cavity. Those with associated lymphedema, more extensive oral cavity involvement, or other visceral disease are considered to have a poor prognosis (T1).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune status (I): the degree of immunosuppression from the HIV infection is an important prognostic factor. Patients with a CD4 count greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> are considered to have a favorable prognosis (I0) while those with a lower CD4 count have classified as poor prognosis (I1). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity of systemic illness (S): Features associated with a poor risk included the following (S1): a history of opportunistic infection, thrush, B symptoms (fever, night sweats, significant weight loss, diarrhea for more than two weeks). Patients without any of these factors have a more favorable prognosis (S0).</p><p/><p>The overall patient assessment requires that good-risk patients have a favorable prognosis according to all three parameters. This was illustrated by an analysis of 144 patients with KS prospectively included in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. On multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with death or a need for chemotherapy included tumor stage T1 rather than T0, a CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> or a positive test for HHV-8 DNA (hazard ratios 5.2, 2.3, and 2.1, respectively).</p><p>Although there is no American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for KS, the AJCC recommends recording the size of the largest lesion, if possible, although this may not be feasible given confluency of lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although the AJCC also notes that previous systems involving the immune status of the patient may be less relevant, given the availability of antiretroviral therapy, it is our view that the immune status of the patient is important. For example, treatment to restore immune integrity with robust CD4+ numbers can in itself result in both regression of some lesions and better response to antiKS modalities. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of a patient with KS consists of a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to those areas typically affected by the disease, such as the lower extremities, face, oral mucosa, genitalia, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation for visceral involvement is guided by symptomatology and basic laboratory testing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing the stool for occult blood is the simplest way to screen for gastrointestinal involvement. Endoscopy is usually reserved for patients who test positive for occult blood or have gastrointestinal symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest x-ray is useful to screen for pulmonary lesions. Bronchoscopy should be reserved for those with an abnormal radiograph and persistent respiratory symptoms in the absence of another cause.</p><p/><p>CT scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is typically not necessary.</p><p>The CD4 cell count and HIV viral load are important for staging and prognosis, and thus may be useful in making treatment decisions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques and interpretation of measurement of the CD4 cell count in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-and-interpretation-of-hiv-1-rna-quantitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques and interpretation of HIV-1 RNA quantitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major goals of treatment are symptom palliation, prevention of disease progression, and shrinkage of tumor to alleviate edema, organ compromise, and psychological stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Systemic treatment with potent combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for virtually all patients with AIDS-related KS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. The need for treatment beyond ART and the choice among the various options depend upon the extent of disease, the rapidity of tumor growth, the HIV-1 viral load, the CD4 cell count, and the patient's overall medical condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Locally directed therapy is often used to palliate symptoms caused by a specific tumor or to treat cosmetic disfigurement. Systemic therapy is used for more extensive disease but injury to an immune system that is already severely compromised should be avoided whenever possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Combined antiretroviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combination ART is recommended for virtually all patients with AIDS-related KS, and may be the only therapy required in the absence of specific indications for chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Systemic chemotherapy'</a> below.) </p><p>The introduction of ART has been associated with a substantial decrease in both the incidence and severity of newly diagnosed KS in HIV infected patients. A French database study that included 54,999 patients with over 180,000 patient years of follow-up found that the incidence rate for new cases of KS fell from 32 per 1000 person-years in 1993-1994 to 3 per 1000 person-years after 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Furthermore, the incidence of visceral involvement at presentation fell from more than 50 percent to less than 30 percent. Similar dramatic decreases have been seen in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Observational studies indicate that the natural history of AIDS-related KS has changed since the introduction of ART in addition to a decrease in the KS incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. A retrospective study that analyzed KS cases from a database of 4439 persons with HIV infection both before ART (1990 to 1996) and after ART (1997 to 2002) found that the mean CD4 count and the mean HIV RNA levels were similar in the 366 patients from the pre-ART era and in the 40 patients in the post-ART era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the overall risk of dying was significantly lower in the post-ART era (hazard ratio, 0.24).</p><p>Immune reconstitution due to control of the HIV infection is the most likely explanation for this altered prognosis rather than a direct effect on tumor. Although HIV protease inhibitors have antiangiogenic properties and block the development and progression of KS-like lesions in nude mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], there was no difference in the likelihood of clinical response associated with the use of these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>]. Furthermore, the decreased incidence of KS has been observed with ART regimens that do not contain protease inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

In addition to worsening of symptoms from preexisting infections with IRIS, the initiation of ART has been associated with progression of KS within three to six weeks after starting antiretroviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The relationship between IRIS and KS is illustrated by a series of 150 therapy-naive patients who presented with KS, 10 (7 percent) developed progressive KS when ART was initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The risk of IRIS appeared to be increased in those with a higher CD4 count or KS-associated edema. Despite the progression of KS, continuation of ART was possible in these patients. Other large series have made similar observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Factors associated with an increased risk of IRIS in patients initiating ART for HIV include more extensive (T1) KS, a higher HIV viral load, and the use of ART without chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Progression of KS in patients with IRIS can be severe and has been associated with death in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Local symptomatic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local treatment modalities are useful for cosmesis or the management of symptomatic bulky KS lesions, but they do not prevent the development of new lesions in untreated areas.</p><p>The most widely used local treatment approaches include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intralesional chemotherapy &ndash; Intralesional chemotherapy can induce regression of injected tumors and is preferred for small lesions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vinblastine</a> is the most widely used agent.

Multiple injections may be necessary for larger lesions. A second series of injections is often necessary three to four weeks later. Treated lesions will fade and regress although typically not resolve completely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. In one series of 42 patients with oral KS, for example, 74 percent showed more than a 50 percent reduction in lesions; palliation was achieved for a mean of 4.3 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; The primary role of radiation therapy is to treat symptomatic disease that is too extensive to be treated with intralesional chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], but is not extensive enough to require systemic therapy. Although discomfort from radiotherapy is frequent, it usually resolves within two weeks of treatment. Radiation therapy does not have a role in patients with extensive KS, as was illustrated by a randomized trial from Zimbabwe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].
