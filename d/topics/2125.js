Red blood cells in the urine can come from the kidney (where urine is made) or anywhere in the urinary tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>). The urinary tract includes the ureters (the tubes that carry the urine from the kidneys to the bladder), the bladder (where urine is stored), the prostate (in men), and the urethra (the tube through which urine exits the body).</p><p>Although seeing blood in the urine can be frightening, most of the time hematuria is not life threatening. However, it is important to investigate the cause of hematuria because, occasionally, it is caused by a serious condition.</p><p>This article will review the potential causes, evaluation, and treatment of blood in the urine in adults. Blood in the urine in children is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). More detailed information is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF HEMATURIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main types of hematuria: gross and microscopic.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gross hematuria &ndash; Gross hematuria means that you can see blood with the naked eye because the urine is pink, red, purplish-red, brownish-red, or tea-colored. If you see blood in your urine, you should call your healthcare provider.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microscopic hematuria &ndash; Microscopic hematuria means that the urine is normal in color, but there are an increased number of red blood cells seen with a microscope. It is usually discovered when a urine sample is tested with a dipstick. The results of a dipstick test are not always accurate and should be confirmed with a microscopic examination.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4883899\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF BLOOD IN THE URINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of conditions can cause hematuria.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder infection (also called acute cystitis), which typically causes burning or pain with urination (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney infection (also called pyelonephritis) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-infection-pyelonephritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Kidney infection (pyelonephritis) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney stones, which usually present with one-sided back or flank pain that can be severe (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain kidney diseases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vigorous exercise or injury (for example, after falling off a bike and bruising a kidney)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enlargement of the prostate (called benign prostatic hyperplasia), which is a common problem in older men</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer of the bladder, prostate, or kidney, more often in patients over age 50 years (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bladder-cancer-diagnosis-and-staging-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bladder cancer diagnosis and staging (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Sometimes, the urine appears to have blood in it because there are other red substances (pigments) in the urine. This can happen if you eat an excessive amount of beets (called beeturia), food dyes, or certain medications (such as <span class=\"nowrap\">phenazopyridine/Pyridium)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of tests available to determine the cause of hematuria. Most people do not need every single test. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests &ndash; Urine tests can provide clues about the cause of hematuria. This may include a urine cytology, which uses a microscope to analyze cells from the lining of the bladder and kidney (found in the urine).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; Blood tests may be used to look for evidence of kidney or other diseases that can cause hematuria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT scan &ndash; Computed tomography, or CT scan, is a radiologic test that examines the structure of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. Kidney stones or abnormalities of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can usually be seen with a CT scan. A dye is usually injected into a vein during the test, which highlights any possible abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney ultrasound &ndash; An ultrasound of the kidney is an alternative to CT scan and is preferred for people who are allergic to the dye used in CT. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the kidney's structure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystoscopy &ndash; Cystoscopy is a procedure that is most often done in an office setting, but sometimes is done as a day surgery procedure. A small tube with a camera is inserted into the bladder through the urethra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>). A numbing gel is applied before the tube is inserted to decrease discomfort. The vast majority of patients tolerate this procedure very well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During cystoscopy, the clinician examines the lining of the bladder to determine whether there are any abnormalities. If abnormal tissue is seen, a biopsy can be taken. The biopsy is examined with a microscope to determine whether abnormal or cancerous cells are present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney biopsy &ndash; During a kidney (renal) biopsy, a clinician removes a small piece of tissue from the kidney; the tissue is later examined with a microscope for signs of kidney disease. A full description of renal biopsy is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-kidney-biopsy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Renal (kidney) biopsy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF BLOOD IN THE URINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no one specific treatment for all cases of hematuria. Rather, treatment is aimed at the specific underlying cause, if a cause can be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Glomerular disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If no underlying cause for hematuria is found during the initial evaluation, follow-up urine testing and blood pressure monitoring may be recommended every three to six months.</p><p>This is especially true if you are at increased risk for bladder cancer. A number of factors can increase your risk of bladder cancer, including being older than 50 years, smoking cigarettes and other tobacco products, and exposure to certain industrial chemicals.
