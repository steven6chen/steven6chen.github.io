While TPMT testing is available, there remains a cost barrier to its use as a first-line test for many patients. In addition, the frequency of homozygous variants is low (about 1 in 300 patients), and polymorphisms in the TPMT gene and their effects are discussed elsewhere. The authors reserve TPMT testing for patients who experience treatment-related leukopenia or other adverse effects (eg, abnormal liver chemistries) after initiating low dose thiopurine (AZA or 6-MP 50 mg daily). While AZA and 6-MP are well-tolerated in many patients with IBD, laboratory monitoring does not always prevent bone marrow suppression or hepatotoxicity, which can be sudden in onset, even after a long duration of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-azathioprine-and-6-mercaptopurine-use-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For empiric weight-based dosing, AZA is initiated at a low dose (0.5 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> estimated lean body weight, daily), and increased incrementally to maximum dose of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily. The equivalent dose of 6-MP is initially 0.25 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> estimated lean body weight, daily, increasing to 1.0 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily. We generally start 6-MP and AZA at 50 mg. If the medication is well-tolerated after one month, then the dose of AZA is increased to 100 mg daily (6-MP is increased to 75 mg daily), depending on the patient's weight. After two months of therapy, the dose of AZA may be further increased to 150 mg daily (6-MP increased to 100 mg daily), provided that the patient is tolerating the drug and the white blood cell (WBC) count is <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;4000/microL</span> and the platelet count is <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;150,000/microL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Dosing and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AZA and 6-MP are both slow-acting drugs. A therapeutic response is typically observed after three months of therapy but may take longer (ie, up to six months) in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H34778636\" class=\"local\">'Timing of response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side effects occur in approximately 10 percent of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are treated with thiopurines and include dose-dependent side effects (eg, bone marrow suppression and hepatotoxicity) and dose-independent side effects (eg, nausea and pancreatitis). These patients are also at increased risk for infection and malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because thiopurine withdrawal is associated with a high rate of disease relapse, we suggest continuing AZA and 6-MP for the long-term in patients with IBD.
