Twenty-six years later the causative <em>CYP11B1</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>CYP11B2</em></span> chimeric gene was discovered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70841 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. GRA is a form of hyperaldosteronism in which the hypersecretion of aldosterone can be reversed with physiologic doses of glucocorticoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>It is rare, as illustrated by a study of 300 consecutive patients with primary aldosteronism; only two patients were diagnosed with GRA (prevalence = 0.66 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal subjects synthesize aldosterone in the zona glomerulosa (which lacks the 17-hydroxylase enzyme required for cortisol synthesis), but not in the corticotropin (ACTH)-sensitive zona fasciculata (which lacks the enzymes required to add the necessary aldehyde to corticosterone at the 18-carbon position). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-steroid-biosynthesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenal steroid biosynthesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with GRA, on the other hand, have ACTH-sensitive aldosterone production occurring in the zona fasciculata. Two isozymes of 11-beta-hydroxylase encoded by two genes on chromosome 8 are responsible for the biosynthesis of aldosterone and cortisol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71558 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The isozyme in the zona glomerulosa (<em>CYP11B2</em>, aldosterone synthase, P450as) catalyzes the conversion of deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone and of 18-hydroxycorticosterone to aldosterone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The isozyme in the zona fasciculata (<em>CYP11B1</em>, P450c11) catalyzes the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol and does not contribute to aldosterone synthesis.</p><p/><p>The mutation in patients with GRA is fusion of the promoter region of the gene for <em>CYP11B1</em> and the coding sequences of <em>CYP11B2</em>, resulting in ACTH-dependent activation of the aldosterone synthase effect on cortisol, corticosterone, and cortisol precursors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70841 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. As a result, these patients are biochemically unique in having markedly increased levels of 18-oxocortisol and 18-hydroxycortisol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/2,3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,7</a>].</p><p>The zona fasciculata location of aldosterone synthesis is probably responsible for another interesting physiologic feature of GRA: Aldosterone release appears to be insensitive to the normally potent stimulus of potassium loading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GRA is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, as a single copy of the abnormal gene is sufficient to cause the disease. The presence of this rare disorder as the cause of primary aldosteronism should be suspected from the positive family history and the typical onset of hypertension before age 21 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The plasma potassium concentration is normal in more than one-half of cases of GRA in contrast to the hypokalemia sometimes seen in primary aldosteronism due to an adrenal adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. One possible explanation for this difference is that aldosterone release in GRA is primarily under the influence of ACTH; with the normal circadian rhythm of ACTH release, aldosterone secretion should be above normal for only part of the day. The lack of aldosterone response to dietary potassium mentioned above would also diminish net aldosterone release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The main clinical clues suggesting GRA in the normokalemic, hypertensive patient are the family history of hypertension, onset at a young age, and the frequent development of marked hypokalemia after the administration of a thiazide diuretic (which increases sodium delivery to the aldosterone-sensitive potassium secretory site in the cortical collecting tubule). The diagnostic approach to patients with the different forms of mineralocorticoid excess is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intrafamily variability appears to occur with GRA, suggesting the presence of variations in the regulation of the altered gene <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> significant effects of modifier genes. This was shown in an affected family in which only one of three individuals with the chimeric gene had classic features of GRA, with the other two being normotensive, normokalemic, and having normal plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Initial anecdotal observations of early cerebrovascular complications in patients with GRA have been confirmed in a review from the international registry for GRA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among patients with GRA, 18 percent had a cerebrovascular complication, 70 percent of which were hemorrhagic strokes due primarily to ruptured intracranial aneurysms. The case fatality rate was 61 percent and the mean age at the initial event was 32 years. In comparison, there were no strokes in GRA-negative family members.</p><p>The factors responsible for the increase in hemorrhagic stroke are uncertain, but it is likely that congenital hypertension during the early stages of cerebrovascular development plays a role. The possible presence of early cerebral hemorrhage in Liddle's syndrome, another form of congenital hypertension, is consistent with this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-disorders-of-the-collecting-tubule-sodium-channel-liddles-syndrome-and-pseudohypoaldosteronism-type-1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic disorders of the collecting tubule sodium channel: Liddle's syndrome and pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of aneurysm rupture in GRA is somewhat higher than that reported in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, another disorder in which hemorrhagic stroke can occur at a young age. It has been suggested that all patients with genetically proven GRA should undergo screening magnetic resonance (MR) angiography at puberty and every five years thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, the benefit of such an approach has not been proven and must be weighed against the risk of prophylactic surgery for small aneurysms that might not rupture. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrarenal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of GRA is suspected on the basis of the clinical features described above. The plasma aldosterone is elevated and plasma renin activity is suppressed, but the aldosterone-renin ratio is typically not as high as with primary aldosteronism caused by an aldosterone-producing adenoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis has, in the past, been established by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> suppression testing and demonstration of hypersecretion of 18-carbon oxidation products of cortisol: 18-hydroxycortisol and 18-oxocortisol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, we suggest that dexamethasone suppression testing be replaced by genetic testing, as described below.</p><p>Genetic testing using molecular biologic techniques to detect the chimeric gene is now preferred over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> suppression testing for making the diagnosis of GRA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The value of this approach was illustrated in a study of 117 patients with primary aldosteronism, none of whom had the chimeric gene but six of whom (one with an adenoma and five with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism) had false-positive dexamethasone suppression tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The genetic test can be obtained by contacting the international GRA registry: <a href=\"http://www.brighamandwomens.org/departments_and_services/medicine/services/endocrine/services/gra/default.aspx&amp;token=k7lno1yog608MLRNsA6Mlq2Hi6c1mVzKXhGY2YaZp4bUl/tAlmyjOAY2Tmut1NwXO1uljwLvKMvrc3aLqgY4PtItad/eAzSxzczvuf1Ac8LpzcJUWZbXokTni2dJg/PB&amp;TOPIC_ID=122\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">International Registry for Glucocorticoid-Remediable Aldosteronism</a>.</p><p>The website has instructions for collecting and mailing blood samples, which should be mailed to Yale University.</p><p>GRA is a rare subtype of primary aldosteronism, and the genetic screen should be performed on selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Indications include primary aldosteronism patients with onset at a young age (eg, &lt;20 years), or a family history of primary aldosteronism or of strokes at a young age (eg, &lt;40 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In 2016, the Endocrine Society published an updated evidence-based guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of primary aldosteronism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Our diagnostic and treatment approach to GRA outlined here is consistent with the guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest the exogenous administration of physiologic doses of a glucocorticoid (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>) as the first-line therapy. It will correct the overproduction of aldosterone by diminishing ACTH release and will usually lower the blood pressure toward or to normal and correct hypokalemia (if present) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/4,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18</a>].</p><p>The smallest effective dose of an intermediate-acting glucocorticoid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) should be administered at bedtime to suppress the early morning surge in ACTH. Target blood pressure in children should be guided by age-specific blood pressure percentiles. Children should be monitored by pediatricians with expertise in glucocorticoid therapy, with careful attention paid to preventing retardation of linear growth by overtreatment.</p><p>An alternative approach is treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which may be just as effective and avoids the potential disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and risk of iatrogenic side effects. In addition, glucocorticoid therapy or mineralocorticoid receptor blockade may even have a role in normotensive GRA patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H563315\"><span class=\"h1\">FAMILIAL HYPERALDOSTERONISM TYPE II (FH TYPE II)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial hyperaldosteronism (FH) type II may be the most common form of FH. Like FH type I, FH type II is associated with hyperaldosteronism and probable autosomal dominant inheritance. Unlike FH type I, hyperaldosteronism in FH type II is not <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> suppressible and is not associated with the hybrid gene mutation. FH type II is the familial occurrence of aldosterone-producing adenoma or bilateral idiopathic hyperplasia, or both, in the same kindred. Biochemically and morphologically, FH type II is indistinguishable from apparently nonfamilial primary aldosteronism.</p><p>In a study of 300 consecutive patients with primary aldosteronism, two patients were diagnosed with FH type I (prevalence = 0.66 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the remaining 199 families who consented to be further investigated, 12 were diagnosed with FH type II (6 percent). The clinical and biochemical phenotypes of FH type II families were not different from sporadic primary aldosteronism patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Similar results were seen in a second series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H563323\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mutations that cause FH type II are unknown, but linkage analysis has mapped them to chromosome 7p22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

The presence of FH type II should be suspected from the positive family history of hypertension. Intrafamily variability is common with some kindred members having primary aldosteronism due to aldosterone-producing adenomas and others due to bilateral idiopathic hyperplasia. Except for familial occurrence, there are no unique features or risks related to FH type II beyond those known for primary aldosteronism.

This initial report included a father and two daughters who all presented with refractory hypertension before age seven years, and all three were treated with bilateral adrenalectomy. The adrenal glands showed massive hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Three years later, the causative germline mutation in this family was discovered: a point mutation in and near the selectivity filter of the potassium channel <em>KCNJ5</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This <em>KCNJ5</em> mutation produces increased sodium conductance and cell depolarization, triggering calcium entry into glomerulosa cells, the signal for aldosterone production and cell proliferation.</p><p>Since this initial report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], other families with early-onset hyperaldosteronism have also been identified to have germline point mutations in the <em>KCNJ5</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In families in Europe with FH (glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism [GRA] excluded), a new germline G151E mutation<em> </em>was found in two primary aldosterone subjects from Italy and they presented a remarkably milder clinical and biochemical phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].<strong> </strong>In four families with early-onset primary aldosteronism, germline G151R mutations were found in two with severe hyperplasia requiring surgery; two kindreds had G151E mutations and mild primary aldosteronism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hyperaldosteronism/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H563247\" class=\"local\">'Familial hyperaldosteronism type I (FH type I) or glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mutation in patients with GRA is fusion of the promoter region of the gene for <em>CYP11B1 </em>and the coding sequence of <em>CYP11B2</em>; these patients are biochemically unique in having markedly increased levels of 18-oxocortisol and 18-hydroxycortisol. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GRA should be suspected as the cause of primary aldosteronism when there is a positive family history and the onset of hypertension is before age 21 years. More than one-half of patients are normokalemic at the time of diagnosis, although they may develop marked hypokalemia after the administration of a thiazide diuretic. Patients with GRA are at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke, due primarily to ruptured intracranial aneurysms. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treating GRA with physiologic doses of a glucocorticoid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This will correct the overproduction of aldosterone by suppressing corticotropin (ACTH) and will usually lower the blood pressure toward or to normal and correct hypokalemia (if present). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists may be equally effective. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FH type II should be considered in all patients with primary aldosteronism who have family members with hypertension. The hypertensive family members should be offered case-detection testing with measurement of plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity. (See <a href=\"#H563331\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FH type II appears to be transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. FH type II has been localized to chromosome 7p22 in some families, but exact location of mutation(s) is unknown to date. (See <a href=\"#H563323\" class=\"local\">'Possible mutations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with FH type II should be treated exactly the same as patients with sporadic primary aldosteronism. (See <a href=\"#H563347\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FH type III is caused by germline mutations in the potassium channel subunit <em>KCNJ5</em>. In addition, somatic mutations in <em>KCNJ5</em> have been identified in aldosterone-producing adenomas. (See <a href=\"#H563363\" class=\"local\">'Mutations in KCNJ5 gene'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Commercially available testing for germline <em>KCNJ5</em> mutations is now available. This rare subtype of primary aldosteronism should be suspected in children with hyperaldosteronism and in families with more than one member with primary aldosteronism. (See <a href=\"#H563379\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FH type III appears to have a variable clinical phenotype. However, in selected cases of refractory disease associated with massive bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy may need to be considered.
