The majority are self-limited viral infections. The evaluation and treatment of athletes with URTIs is typically the same as in the general population. However, there are specific considerations for medication choices in athletes. Additionally, clinicians may be asked to determine when an athlete can return to play or competition.</p><p>This topic will discuss the epidemiology, evaluation, and specific medication considerations in athletes with URTI.

infections (URTIs) are the most common type of infection in athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In general, the incidence in athletes is the same as nonathletes. In the majority of cases, URTIs are self-limited viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4395175\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little evidence that the incidence of URTI varies by sport. However, athletes in some sports are at higher risk for viral illnesses, such as influenza and infectious mononucleosis, as a consequence of close contact with teammates and opponents. URTIs are the most common cause of illness at national and international sporting competitions, likely related to increased exposure to pathogens during both travel and competition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>].</p><p>Athletes appear to be at greater risk of infection during the winter months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This likely has to do with the seasonal variations of pathogens that cause URTIs (eg, influenza), as well as increased indoor crowding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-influenza#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of influenza&quot;, section on 'Seasonality'</a>.)</p><p>A small number of athletes have problems with persistent or recurrent URTIs. Athletes at higher risk of developing URTIs are likely to include older adults and those with a history of recurrent or persistent illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The risk of illness may increase when an athlete is exposed to sleep disturbances, severe psychosocial stress, a major personal crisis, or an imbalance between psychological stress and recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20838737\"><span class=\"h2\">Relationship to exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationship between infection and exercise is poorly understood. The risk of illness appears to increase with prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intensive training, especially in susceptible athletes (eg, poorly-controlled asthmatics, those with chronic disease, those who are immunosuppressed, or those who have had a recent infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A number of models have been developed to characterize relationships between the <span class=\"nowrap\">volume/intensity</span> of exercise (and training) and risk of URTI. The J-curve model is based on evidence that moderately-active individuals typically have a lower risk of URTI compared with sedentary individuals, but some highly-trained athletes have a paradoxically heightened risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Another model is the open window theory, where the immune system is temporarily down-regulated in the hours after strenuous exercise or training leading to a 'window' of opportunity for infections to become established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91274813\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on competition performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections that coincide with the preparations for or actual competition may impair performance if the symptoms are moderate to severe. For example, the prolonged cough experienced by those with pertussis can hamper athletic performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Infections occurring early in the season well away from competition are unlikely to have substantial effects on competitive performance, unless a significant amount of training time is lost. In a retrospective study of 69 swimmers, mild infections (predominantly URTIs) lasting two or more days in the six weeks prior to international competition had little adverse effect on performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4395817\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of athletes for the various etiologies of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) is the same as for the general population.</p><p>Although it is not always necessary to obtain a white blood cell count (WBC) in the evaluation of URTI, exercise appears to affect WBC counts and function. The clinical importance of these changes is unclear. Prolonged endurance training can lead to leukopenia, but this is likely not pathologic. In one study including over 900 females and 1300 males in 14 sports, 16 percent of athletes who participated in aerobic sports (eg, cycling or the triathlon) had WBC counts that were below the normal reference range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Also, acute exercise will typically increase the numbers of circulating leukocytes, but changes are transient and of little clinical significance.

However, certain antibiotics have adverse effects that may have implications for athletes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F102914\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102914 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluoroquinolones </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>When other options are available, we avoid prescribing fluoroquinolones in athletes because they are associated with tendinopathy and tendon rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. When fluoroquinolones are the best option for treatment, we monitor athletes for tendon pain. Any athlete that develops tendon pain while on fluoroquinolones should stop the medication and seek prompt evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoroquinolones#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fluoroquinolones&quot;, section on 'Tendinopathy and tendon rupture'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additionally, fluoroquinolones are associated with photosensitivity and QT prolongation, which have specific implications for athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-respiratory-tract-infections-considerations-in-adolescent-and-adult-athletes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In athletes that use fluoroquinolones, we recommend precautions such as sunscreen and protective clothing, particularly if they participate in outdoor sports. Some athletes will undergo electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluation for participation <span class=\"nowrap\">clearance/eligibility</span>. If an athlete needs ECG testing around the time of antibiotic therapy, it is reasonable to avoid the use of fluoroquinolones where possible. We also avoid fluoroquinolones in athletes who have borderline QT intervals.

Determining if the fatigue is from illness versus the medication can be difficult. If there is concern that antibiotics may be causing fatigue, when possible, we time the antibiotic to avoid dosing around the time of competition or an important event (eg, stopping antibiotics for acne prophylaxis).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92871399\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications used for symptom relief</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some medications used for symptom relief (adjunctive medications) may contain banned substances (eg, decongestants) and should be avoided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F102914\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102914 \">table 1</a>).

If there are symptoms present &quot;below the neck&quot; (eg, fever, malaise, chest congestion, or gastrointestinal symptoms), athletes should be kept from participation until symptoms have resolved. Cough may be an &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; the neck symptom, depending on the etiology of the cough. For example, if cough is from post-nasal drip, it is &quot;above the neck,&quot; but if from pneumonia, it is &quot;below the neck.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fever or systemic signs (presumed viral illness) </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>When fever or other systemic signs of illness are present from presumed viral illness, the athlete should refrain from exercise.

Unexplained sinus tachycardia may be the only sign of myocarditis, an uncommon complication of URTI caused by certain viruses (the most common of which include coxsackie B virus, adenovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56995 \">table 2</a>)).

If they feel well during this initial trial, they may proceed with exercise as tolerated. Anecdotally, some athletes report that light exercise provides symptomatic relief and an opportunity to clear the sinuses and airways of phlegm and mucus. If an athlete is not able to tolerate light exercise, they should rest and try again the following day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Returning after fever or systemic illness </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>When the athlete returns to play, they should start with light activity and follow a graded return to play based on their response. Typically, the sequence of training increments should be increasing frequency first, then duration, and finally, intensity of exercise. The exact time course will depend on the severity and duration of the underlying infection. A general rule is for every day missed due to illness, the athlete needs two to three days of graded return (eg, if an athlete misses two days of practice due to illness, they should gradually increase activity over four to six days until they are back to normal practice). Increments in training volume and intensity should be limited to approximately 10 percent at a time to avoid overexertion in the early phase of return.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In certain situations, it may be appropriate to allow modified participation in sport while an athlete recovers from a URTI. For example, the athlete may be allowed to shoot free throws at basketball practice away from the team if they are afebrile but still recovering from &quot;below the neck&quot; symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H610041056\"><span class=\"h2\">Return to competition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clearance for competition is the same as for general sports participation. Those with mild viral URTIs can compete as long as they feel able. An athlete should be held from competition if they have fever or systemic signs of illness in order to prevent more significant illness and to avoid spread of disease. Fever, hypoxia, and dehydration are absolute contraindications to participation. Relative contraindications include the athlete not feeling physically able to participate and infection with an illness that is highly contagious (eg, influenza or pertussis).
