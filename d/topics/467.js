Adequate patient tolerance is essential for successful completion of a safe examination and compliance with subsequent follow-up. As a result, endoscopists have developed skills in administering a variety of sedative and analgesic agents to facilitate procedures and enhance patient comfort. However, a number of adverse events related to procedural sedation have been described.</p><p>This topic review will focus on the adverse events related to procedural sedation for GI endoscopy. An overview of procedural sedation for endoscopic procedures, issues related to endoscopic procedures without sedation, and the management of patients who are difficult to sedate are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedation-free-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedation-free gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternatives-and-adjuncts-to-moderate-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alternatives and adjuncts to moderate procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EVENTS RELATED TO PHARYNGEAL ANESTHESIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H834448090\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main concern related to topical pharyngeal anesthesia is inhibition of the gag reflex and the risk of aspiration. Oversedation may exacerbate this risk. This is particularly important in the management of patients with acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Endotracheal intubation for airway protection should be considered to prevent life-threatening aspiration in patients with active hematemesis. It may also be advisable to avoid topical inhibition of the gag reflex in such patients and in other individuals at high risk for aspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56501\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56501 \">table 1</a>).

The blood in methemoglobinemia has been variously described as dark-red, chocolate, or brownish to blue in color, and unlike deoxyhemoglobin, the color does not change with the addition of oxygen. Pulse oximetry is inaccurate in monitoring oxygen saturation in the presence of methemoglobinemia.

Risk factors for the development of cardiopulmonary adverse events include advanced age, underlying comorbid illness (especially pulmonary disease), dementia, anemia, obesity, significant cardiovascular disease (eg, heart failure or severe valvular disease), and endoscopy performed for emergent indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Adverse events resulting from oversedation include hypoventilation, airway obstruction, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, hypotension, vasovagal episodes, arrhythmias, and aspiration. The frequency of such unplanned cardiopulmonary events has been shown to be associated with increasing American Society of Anesthesiologists scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The overall incidence of cardiopulmonary adverse events is low, but important. In a prospective survey of 14,149 upper endoscopies and a retrospective study of 21,011 procedures, the rate of early cardiopulmonary events was 2 to 5.4 per 1000 cases, and the mortality rate, which included cases of aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction, was 0.3 to 0.5 per 1000 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypoxemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the potential causes of cardiopulmonary adverse events is arterial oxygen desaturation, which can result from oversedation. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Oversedation and adverse events related to reversal agents'</a> below.)</p><p>Hypoxemia is common during endoscopic procedures. This was illustrated in a study in which arterial oxygen saturation was measured in 236 consecutive patients undergoing elective endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A drop in the oxygen saturation to below 90 percent was observed in 40 percent of individuals having an upper endoscopy and 54 percent of those having a colonoscopy. A similar incidence of oxygen desaturation (41 percent) was observed in another report of 103 consecutive colonoscopies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the case of upper endoscopy, oxygen desaturation is largely related to the use of sedation rather than the passage of an endoscope along the airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Some degree of hypoxemia can be noted during endoscopy, even in patients who do not receive procedural sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In one study, for example, 9 percent of individuals undergoing unsedated flexible sigmoidoscopy had an episode of hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Causes of hypoxemia in this setting may include breathholding or comorbid illnesses.</p><p>Other risk factors for hypoxemia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of a benzodiazepine and opioid, which significantly increases the risk of hypoxemia compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high frequency of oxygen desaturation (up to 50 percent) is seen with procedures of longer duration, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, providing a rationale for the routine use of supplemental oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Other patient characteristics that may increase the risk of sedation-induced hypoxemia during endoscopy include older age, underlying lung disease, anemia, and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In contrast, patients with cirrhosis do not appear to be at increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, most studies suggest patients with obstructive sleep apnea are not at increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>].</p><p>Routine pulse oximetry is suggested in all patients undergoing endoscopy since the variables discussed above are not sufficiently precise to predict which patients are at risk for becoming hypoxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/7-9,12,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,12,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>A potentially important limitation of pulse oximetry is that it is a delayed indicator of airway obstruction and hypoventilation due to respiratory depression, particularly in patients receiving supplemental oxygen. Thus, hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis resulting from airway obstruction and respiratory depression occur prior to desaturation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-evaluation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-the-adult-patient-with-acute-hypercapnic-respiratory-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the adult patient with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of hypoventilation is increased with obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, and the use of high doses of opioids or benzodiazepines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition to their sedative effects, opioids and benzodiazepines inhibit the central responsiveness to carbon dioxide, leading to decreased respiratory drive.</p><p>The degree to which different benzodiazepines inhibit the respiratory drive is variable. In a comparison of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> for procedural sedation, the rate of respiratory depression, as indicated by elevated end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> pressure, was slightly higher with midazolam during the first 45 minutes after drug administration, but higher with diazepam during the recovery period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac arrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of cardiac arrhythmias during endoscopy depends upon the patient's age, underlying medical conditions, the incidence of significant arterial oxygen desaturation (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Hypoxemia'</a> above), and the type of procedure. Some of these issues were illustrated in a study in which Holter monitoring was used to detect cardiac arrhythmias in 164 patients undergoing elective upper endoscopy who were randomly assigned to one of three groups that differed in either endoscope diameter or use of sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The overall incidence of arrhythmias was significantly higher among individuals with prior cardiovascular disease compared with those without cardiovascular disease (30 versus 6 percent). The most common arrhythmia was sinus tachycardia, the presence of which significantly correlated with patient tolerance of the procedure. Among patients receiving sedation, arrhythmias were more common in patients who experienced oxygen desaturations than in patients who did not experience oxygen desaturations (75 versus 46 percent). There were also more electrocardiographic abnormalities during examinations with larger endoscopes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H834447730\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypotension is another potential complication of procedural sedation. In one study of the effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> in patients undergoing colonoscopy, hypotension developed in 19 percent (compared with 3 to 7 percent of patients in the control groups) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Consequences of hypotension can include ischemia and infarction in susceptible organs (eg, the brain and heart in patients with vascular disease).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H834447948\"><span class=\"h3\">Phlebitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous administration of sedatives and analgesics is associated with a small risk of phlebitis. The risk appears to be higher with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The risk of phlebitis from diazepam is increased with injection into a small caliber vein and increasing duration of infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Administration of medications through a running intravenous line may reduce pain at the infusion site.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propofol</a>, which is used for deeper sedation, can cause pain on injection, particularly when administered through a small vein, but does not cause phlebitis. This may be averted by the pre-administration of a small amount of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> (10 to 20 mg).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Oversedation and adverse events related to reversal agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agents to treat oversedation may be needed if patients exhibit signs of respiratory depression, such as hypoxemia or decreased ventilation, despite supplemental oxygen or gentle stimulation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Naloxone</a> is given to reverse the effects of opioids, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a> is given to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines.

However, it is not our practice to use them to speed recovery due to, at best, marginal benefits, added cost, and risk of resedation when the reversal agents wear off.</p><p>There is no reversal agent for oversedation due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, an agent used to achieve deeper levels of sedation. Oversedation due to propofol must be managed by supportive measures, including proper airway management, until the drug rapidly wears off.

This requires postprocedure monitoring if one of these agents is used.
