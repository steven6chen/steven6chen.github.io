Although exacerbations are common, most are mild and can be managed successfully at home. Children with severe exacerbations or those who fail to improve with outpatient therapy may need to be evaluated and treated in an urgent care or emergency department (ED), and some will need to be admitted to the hospital for further management.</p><p>Inpatient management of acute asthma exacerbation in children is discussed here. Outpatient and intensive care unit (ICU) management are discussed separately.

For patients newly diagnosed with asthma, it is important to anticipate the need for medication equipment, such as a spacer (preferably a valved holding chamber) or a nebulizer with compressor, so that it can be delivered to the family and they can learn how to use it before the child is discharged. (See <a href=\"#H37\" class=\"local\">'Discharge medications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">STANDARD THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard asthma treatment includes inhaled, short-acting, selective beta-2 adrenergic agonists (SABAs or beta agonists), systemic glucocorticoids, and supplemental oxygen, when needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53629\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53629 \">table 1</a>). Our approach is consistent with expert guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhaled short-acting beta agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that children who are admitted to the hospital with acute asthma exacerbation receive therapy with inhaled SABAs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a>, salbutamol) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The frequency of dosing depends upon the severity of the exacerbation and the patient's response to treatment. Continuous therapy is suggested in patients who have minimal to no improvement after the first few inhaled beta agonist treatments <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who continue to require treatments more frequently than every two to three hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled beta agonists, most commonly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a>, can be administered continuously (via nebulizer) or intermittently (via metered-dose inhaler [MDI] with spacer or nebulizer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>]. Nebulizers have not been shown to be superior to spacers in preventing hospital admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Either MDI or nebulization is suggested for use in acute asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Some hospitals only permit continuous administration in the intensive care unit (ICU). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Continuous therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-intensive-care-unit-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute severe asthma exacerbations in children: Intensive care unit management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Delivery systems for SABA are discussed separately.

However, weight-based dosing of inhaled medications may not be appropriate for young children, because of the low deposition of medication in the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>]. Standard doses, such as 2.5 mg of nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a> for children who weigh less than 30 kg and 5 mg for children who weigh more than 30 kg, may be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Common MDI doses for albuterol in children range from four to eight puffs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of treatments depends upon the patient's asthma severity or asthma score as determined by the clinician. Children with moderate exacerbations usually require inhaled SABA every one to three hours. Treatments are typically switched to continuous therapy if patients require treatment more often than every two hours. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Clinical assessment'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-home-office-management-and-severity-assessment#H8556562\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute asthma exacerbations in children: Home/office management and severity assessment&quot;, section on 'Asthma severity scores'</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be evaluated upon admission, every one to two hours while receiving continuous inhaled beta agonist therapy, and before and after intermittent treatments to determine their response to therapy. Patients receiving continuous inhaled beta agonist therapy additionally should be on continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who do not improve or who clinically worsen need more frequent or additional treatments. Patients who are stable but not significantly improved should continue on the same frequency of treatments. Patients with clear improvement in clinical parameters should have the interval between their treatments increased. In addition to the regularly scheduled beta agonist treatment, &quot;as needed&quot; treatments should be available for episodes of acute bronchospasm or worsening respiratory distress. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Clinical assessment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Failure to respond'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Continuous therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Some institutions have established multidisciplinary protocols (clinical pathways or care paths) for increasing or decreasing the frequency of inhaled SABA treatments based upon asthma scores or other methods of assessment performed largely by respiratory therapists <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nurses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/4,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20,21</a>]. One example is the modified Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91732 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The effect of such protocols was evaluated in a systematic review, which found that the use of clinical pathways appeared to be effective in reducing length of stay and hospital costs associated with pediatric asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/6,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23</a>]. However, they were less effective in reducing readmission rates or affecting clinical outcomes, such as increasing asthma education, and the use of controller medications or spacers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Continuous therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that patients who have poor improvement after several inhaled beta agonist treatments or who require treatments more frequently than every two hours be treated with continuous beta agonist nebulization. Patients treated with continuous therapy who do not improve rapidly should be monitored closely for worsening respiratory status. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Data in adults indicate that continuous nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a> is as efficacious as intermittent nebulization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24</a>]. Continuous nebulized albuterol also appears to be safe and effective in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. Results from one small, randomized trial suggest that continuous nebulization of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levalbuterol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levalbuterol</a> (levosalbutamol), which consists of only the R-enantiomer of albuterol, is no more effective than albuterol, which is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Continuous nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a> is typically given at a dose of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per hour for children and 10 to 15 mg per hour for adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53629\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53629 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

General principles to determine appropriate discharge may be used. Patients may be discharged when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Their asthma symptoms and signs (and scores, if available) are considered mild. Standardized tools, such as the Pediatric Dyspnea Scale (PDS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80389 \">figure 2</a>), may be useful. In one study, the PDS predicted poor outcomes after discharge, including relapse and activity limitation, and was a better indicator than measures of pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They no longer require supplemental oxygen (SpO<sub>2</sub> &ge;94 percent without supplemental oxygen).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are receiving a treatment regimen that can be reasonably duplicated at home (eg, they are tolerating oral medications and the frequency and proper technique of inhalation treatments can be managed by the caregiver, usually every four to six hours). If possible, patients should be observed in the hospital for at least one interval while receiving the treatments that will be prescribed after discharge. If patients have been receiving nebulized medications, they may be changed to metered-dose inhaler (MDI)-spacer after continuous therapy is no longer needed or any time prior to discharge, provided they can demonstrate proper technique.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Access to medications and appropriate follow-up have been confirmed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma education is complete.

The patient's preadmission medication regimen, asthma severity classification, and asthma control should be reviewed and controller medications adjusted as indicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80908%7EPULM%2F71181\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80908 graphicRef71181 \">table 4A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76669%7EPULM%2F67459\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76669 graphicRef67459 \">figure 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78322%7EPULM%2F64986\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78322 graphicRef64986 \">table 5A-B</a>).</p><p>Discharge medications should include an inhaled short-acting beta agonist (SABA), either via nebulizer or MDI with a spacer, and oral glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-inpatient-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The beta agonist should be continued roughly every four to six hours until the patient is seen in follow-up within three to five days. Frequency can then be decreased or returned to &quot;as needed&quot; depending upon the rate of clinical improvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral glucocorticoids are usually continued for a total of five days. Indications for longer courses are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H731709\" class=\"local\">'Dose and duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for daily controller therapy should be reviewed prior to discharge. Step-up therapy is often indicated in patients who were already on controller medication prior to the admission (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76669%7EPULM%2F67459\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76669 graphicRef67459 \">figure 1A-B</a>). Daily controller therapy, at least for a few months, is indicated for almost all children who have been hospitalized with an asthma exacerbation. Controller medications and preferred regimens are discussed in detail separately.

One way of assuring this is to have the family fill the prescriptions before discharge. An advantage of this approach is that it permits the inpatient team to review the proper technique for medication administration. If the family is unable to fill the prescriptions before discharge, patient demonstrator devices may be used to review technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h2\">Discharge education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inpatient hospitalization is an excellent time to provide education about asthma. Every interaction should be viewed as an opportunity to educate the patient and family.</p><p>The various aspects of asthma education can be provided by any member of the health care team with adequate training.
