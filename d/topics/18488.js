The muscles tighten when something is about to be put in the vagina, such as a penis, tampon, or medical device. Vaginismus causes pain during sex. A woman might also have pain if a doctor or nurse does a pelvic exam.</p><p>Vaginismus can happen if a woman has anxiety about sex or pelvic exams or has had a bad experience with either of these in the past. It can also happen if a woman has an infection or other medical condition in the vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29965031\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of vaginismus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom of vaginismus is pain when something is put in the vagina, such as a penis, finger, tampon, or medical device.

Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. He or she might be able to feel the muscles around the opening to your vagina tighten during an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29965076\"><span class=\"h1\">How is vaginismus treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for any medical condition that is causing pain, such as an infection or skin irritation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercises to help relax the tight muscles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy to loosen the muscles around your vagina</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devices called &quot;dilators&quot; you place in your vagina &ndash; These can help you get used to having something in the vagina.
