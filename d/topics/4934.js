People with delirium often have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble paying attention, or switching attention from one thing to another</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory, language, or other thinking problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble knowing where they are, when it is, or who the people around them are</p><p/><p>People with delirium are often very sleepy or hard to wake up. They can also be overly active or upset, or see or hear things that aren't really there.</p><p>Symptoms of delirium can come and go over the course of a day, and often get worse toward the end of the day. Delirium can last days to weeks, depending on what's causing it.</p><p>There are other terms that might come up when doctors talk about delirium. Doctors sometimes use the term &quot;altered mental status&quot; for when a person's brain isn't working normally. The word &quot;confusion&quot; means a person isn't thinking clearly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10514428\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes delirium?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different kinds of conditions or situations can cause delirium. The most common reasons people have delirium are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A medical condition, such as low blood sugar, pneumonia (infection of the lungs), or kidney failure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A side effect of medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Illegal drug use</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol withdrawal &ndash; This is when people suddenly stop drinking after they have been drinking a lot of alcohol every day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A problem in the brain, such as infection, seizure, or some types of strokes &ndash; Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can make people move or behave strangely. A stroke is when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow.</p><p/><p>Delirium happens more often in people who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are in the hospital</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Just had surgery or are in pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are older, have a lot of medical problems, or take a lot of medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have another brain disorder, such as dementia &ndash; Dementia is a disorder that causes memory problems and makes it hard to think clearly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10514443\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Many people who get delirium are already in a hospital. But if you are not in a hospital, it's important to call the doctor or nurse if you notice the symptoms listed above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10514458\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask questions to check thinking and attention. He or she will do tests to find out what's causing the delirium. The tests will depend on the individual situation and can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan of the head &ndash; A CT scan is an imaging test that can create pictures of the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lumbar puncture (sometimes called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) &ndash; During this procedure, a doctor will put a thin needle into the lower back and take out a small amount of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. He or she will send the spinal fluid to a lab for tests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An EEG (or &quot;electroencephalogram&quot;) &ndash; An EEG is a test that measures electrical activity in the brain and records brain wave patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55691\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55691 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10514473\"><span class=\"h1\">How is delirium treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors treat delirium by treating the cause of the delirium, if it can be treated. For example, if a medicine is causing delirium, the doctor will stop or change that medicine. If an infection is causing delirium, he or she will treat the infection.</p><p>Doctors also treat delirium by helping a person's symptoms until the delirium gets better. Different ways doctors can do this include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making the person's hospital room as quiet as possible, especially at night</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving the person medicine to help him or her sleep better at night</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having the hospital staff remind the person where he or she is, and why he or she is in the hospital</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving the person medicine to help calm him or her down</p><p/><p>Also, it often helps people with delirium to have family and other familiar people around them in the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10514488\"><span class=\"h1\">Can delirium be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. Doctors try to lower the chances that patients in the hospital will get delirium by doing a few different things. These include making the patient's room quiet or helping the patient sleep well. If your family member is in the hospital, talk with his or her doctor or nurse about how to help prevent delirium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10514503\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eeg-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: EEG (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
