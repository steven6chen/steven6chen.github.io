Most embolic events occur within 10 days of reversion to SR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Patients undergoing cardioversion of AF of more than 48 hours duration represent a particularly high-risk group (compared with AF of less than 48 hours duration), with an embolic risk from as low as 1 to as high as 5 percent in the first month after reversion to SR in the absence of anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/2-4,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,6-8</a>]. This rate is substantially higher than the rate that would be calculated for the general population of patients with AF, in whom the yearly rate is between 1.3 and 5.1 (or higher) percent, depending on age and additional comorbidities.

Possible causes include embolism at the time of conversion of a left atrial clot that was already present, embolism of a clot that forms after conversion due to post-conversion worsening of left atrial mechanical function, and clot formation from recurrent episodes of AF: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-cardioversion left atrial thrombus. Embolization after return of synchronous atrial contraction is due to the dislodgement of left atrial thrombi present at the time of cardioversion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The rate of left atrial thrombus in patients studied with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has been between 12 and 14 percent with AF duration of less than 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. These values, which did not differ in those with AF of &le;2 days and two to three days duration, are similar to the 12 to 13 percent incidence noted above in TEE studies of patients with new onset AF of more than two days duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The prevalence is increased in high-risk patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left atrial enlargement, depressed left atrial appendage ejection velocity, or left atrial appendage spontaneous echo contrast (a marker of stasis). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-cardioversion left atrial appendage contractile <span class=\"nowrap\">dysfunction/stunning</span> that has been described with spontaneous, pharmacologic, and electrical conversion.

The transient atrial contractile dysfunction after cardioversion is referred to as atrial &quot;stunning&quot; and can occur whether SR is restored spontaneously, by external or internal direct current cardioversion, or by antiarrhythmic medications. The duration of the left atrial contractile dysfunction appears to be related in part to the duration of AF prior to cardioversion.

When possible, the patient should receive a pre-cardioversion heparin bolus, but availability should not delay emergent cardioversion.

In these patients, the risk of thromboembolism after cardioversion can be diminished to less than 1 percent (during the four weeks after cardioversion) by the use of one month of therapeutic antithrombotic therapy prior to (and extending for one month after) cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/2-4,6,7,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,6,7,20-22</a>]. </p><p>For patients in whom there is a reason to not wait four weeks, an option for management is pre-cardioversion anticoagulation of shorter (less than one month) duration in conjunction with a screening transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to guide early cardioversion. This strategy can be used for patients in whom cardioversion needs to be performed either urgently or before four weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation have been completed (but when the patient is fully anticoagulated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Another potential reason to consider this strategy is that a shorter period of AF may increase the likelihood of successful cardioversion and long-term maintenance of SR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm#H8701654\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;, section on 'DC cardioversion'</a>.)</p><p>The TEE approach should include the following sequential steps before cardioversion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For inpatients, the options include using heparin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or using an NOAC.

There are multiple factors that determine whether a NOAC or warfarin would be used, including cost and patient preference, but NOACs have the advantage of faster onset of action and ease of dosing. A strategy of at least two days of NOAC prior to TEE-guided cardioversion can be used. As an alternative, oral warfarin can be started five days before TEE with the target INR 2.0 to 3.0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

If no cardioversion is desired, a follow-up TEE is not needed, as the patient should receive lifelong antithrombotic therapy. If thrombus is absent on repeat TEE, cardioversion may be performed. If thrombus is still evident, the rhythm control strategy may be changed to a rate control strategy, especially when AF-related symptoms are controlled, since there is a high risk of thromboembolism if cardioversion is performed.

However, we believe that many, and perhaps most, patients cannot accurately define the onset of AF. As a result, we label a patient as having AF of less than 48 hours duration only if we have a high level of confidence in the patient&rsquo;s history. Otherwise, we approach the patient as if AF has been present for more than 48 hours. </p><p>The choice of 48 hours for the cut-off is arbitrary and based on limited evidence. For example, the prevalence of left atrial thrombus on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is substantially lower when the duration of AF is less than 48 hours (1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Some of our experts are comfortable recommending early cardioversion only if the duration is less than 24 hours. This shorter duration is based on limited evidence suggesting the risk of embolic events is significantly greater after 24 hours compared with 6 to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p>However, an attempt at cardioversion does not apply to extremely high-risk patients (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">rheumatic/valvular</span> disease; severe left ventricular dysfunction; prosthetic valves; or prior thromboembolism, heart failure, or diabetes).

A retrospective study of 3143 patients with AF of less than 48 hours duration demonstrated that patients with heart failure and diabetes were at high risk for clinical thromboembolism (up to 10 percent if both risk factors were present).

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Atrial fibrillation of more than 48 hours duration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for anticoagulation'</a> above.) </p><p>There are two central clinical questions with regard to the use of anticoagulant therapy in patients where the duration of the episode is definitely less than 48 hours and early cardioversion is being considered: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should an anticoagulant be used prior to restoration of sinus rhythm (and if so, which one)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should an oral anticoagulant be given for four weeks after restoration of sinus rhythm?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1235130486\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation prior to cardioversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in whom cardioversion will take place in less than 48 hours, we start a NOAC in <strong>all</strong> <strong>patients</strong> with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score &ge;1 rather than no anticoagulant. Intravenous heparin is a reasonable alternative for hospitalized patients (see below). If cardioversion needs to take place within six hours, whether for patient instability or convenience, we start intravenous heparin or a low molecular weight heparin; we do not give NOAC and heparin together. (See <a href=\"#H1642614226\" class=\"local\">'Urgent cardioversion'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients at very high bleeding risk, some of our experts suggest cardioversion without anticoagulation if normal sinus rhythm can be restored within 48 hours of documented onset. Other experts recommend anticoagulation prior to cardioversion even in these high-bleeding-risk patients. </p><p>We generally wait to cardiovert until six hours after the first dose of NOAC. When a NOAC is used, we have no preference for a particular agent. We generally choose the agent that will be given at the time of discharge.

If a heparin is used, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> is started simultaneously and the heparin is continued until the international normalized ratio exceeds 2.0. </p><p>With regard to the question as to whether to anticoagulate these patients or not, there are no studies comparing heparin with no heparin in patients with AF of less than 48 hours duration. However, data regarding the rate of clinical thromboembolization after cardioversion in patients with AF of less than 48 hours duration have raised a concern about the safety of cardioversion <strong>without</strong> anticoagulation in this population. In an observational study of 2481 such individuals (5116 successful cardioversions) who were not treated with peri- or post-procedural anticoagulant, definite thromboembolic events occurred in 38 (0.7 percent) within in 30 days (median of two days); of these, 31 were strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Four additional patients suffered a transient ischemic attack. Age greater than 60 years, female sex, heart failure, and diabetes were the strongest predictors of embolization, with nearly 10 percent of those with both heart failure and diabetes experiencing a stroke. The risk of stroke in those without heart failure and age less than 60 years was 0.2 percent. An observational study of 16,274 patients undergoing direct current cardioversion with and without oral anticoagulant therapy also demonstrated that the absence of post-cardioversion anticoagulation was associated with a high risk of thromboembolism, regardless of CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. There was a greater-than-twofold increased risk of thromboembolism in those <strong>not</strong> treated with post-cardioversion anticoagulation (hazard ratio 2.21; 95% CI 0.79-6.77 and 2.40; 95% CI 1.46-3.95 with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score 0 to 1 and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score 2 or more, respectively). The rationale for lack of post-cardioversion anticoagulation could not be exactly discerned in this trial but was deemed to be multifactorial, including presumed short-duration AF, perceived low thromboembolic risk, and lack of guideline adherence. &#160;</p><p>With regard to the question of which anticoagulant to use, there are no studies comparing differing forms of heparin in patients with AF of short duration nor are there studies comparing a newer oral anticoagulant with heparin. Indirect evidence comparing the two heparins comes from a trial of 496 patients with AF of more than 48 hours duration who were randomly assigned to either low molecular weight heparin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> followed by oral anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Patients were cardioverted after either 21 days of anticoagulation or after a TEE that was negative for thrombus; anticoagulation continued for 28 days after cardioversion. Low molecular weight heparin was noninferior to unfractionated heparin followed by oral anticoagulation in terms of the combined primary end point of ischemic neurologic events, major hemorrhage, or death by the end of study treatment (2.8 versus 4.8 percent). Low molecular weight heparin also has a safety and efficacy profile similar to unfractionated heparin when used as a bridge to oral anticoagulation in patients undergoing TEE-based therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4155084568\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation after cardioversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of our contributors anticoagulate their patients for four weeks after reversion to sinus rhythm in patients with AF of less than 48 hours duration.
