Lipomastia is more apparent in the sitting than in the supine position.

Although the prevalence of fibrocystic changes in adolescents is not known, more than 50 percent of women of reproductive age have fibrocystic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The etiology is unknown, but fibrocystic changes are thought to result from an imbalance between estrogen and progesterone. Some studies have suggested that caffeine worsens the symptoms, but others have failed to demonstrate this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p>Patients with fibrocystic change present with painful breast tissue before menses and report improvement during menstruation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. On examination, fibrotic tissue may be palpated and is generally found in the upper outer quadrants of the breast. A serosanguineous discharge may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Ultrasonography may be helpful in the diagnosis; mammography is not indicated for adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The treatment of fibrocystic change in adolescents may include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild analgesia (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, NSAIDS).

The prevalence in the general population of women in their second or third decade is approximately 2 percent; the prevalence in specialty clinics ranges from 7 to 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Fibroadenomas account for 30 to 50 percent of breast masses in adolescents in medical series and 44 to 94 percent of breast masses in surgical series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Fibroadenomas typically are asymptomatic but may cause discomfort for a few days before the onset of menses. On examination, fibroadenomas are rubbery, well circumscribed, and mobile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The average size is 2 to 3 cm (range 1 to 10 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. They are most frequently found in the upper, outer quadrants but may occur in any quadrant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Ultrasonographic evaluation reveals a solid avascular mass that is well circumscribed. Mammography is not indicated to evaluate masses in the adolescent, because the large amount of glandular tissue present in adolescents makes mammography difficult to interpret [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Histologically, fibroadenomas consist of proliferating stroma.</p><p>Management of fibroadenomas entails careful follow-up and reassurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], as most fibroadenomas in adolescents decrease in size, and some completely disappear with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Fibroadenomas less than 5 cm without concerning features can be observed at one to two month intervals for growth or regression. When the mass regresses, observation at three to four month intervals (with increasingly longer intervals each time) are appropriate for up to two years while the mass is regressing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. If there is persistence of the lesion, an ultrasound can be obtained. If the ultrasound characteristics are entirely consistent with a fibroadenoma, the mass need not be biopsied or excised unless there is overriding clinical concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The decision to proceed with excision is based on family anxiety, history of breast cancer, and the patient's age. Most physicians recommend excision of persistent masses as girls approach adulthood because the risk of breast cancer increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Reports of malignancy associated with a preexisting fibroadenoma in adolescents are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>However, if there is growth of the lesion, the lesion is greater than 5 cm, or the lesion persists to adulthood, excisional biopsy is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Disadvantages of excisional surgery include scarring at the incision site, dimpling of the breast from the removal of the tumor, damage to the breast's duct system, and mammographic changes (eg, architectural distortion, skin thickening, increased focal density).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Giant fibroadenoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Giant fibroadenomas grow rapidly to greater than 5 cm and may compress or replace normal breast tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Giant fibroadenomas should be excised because they cannot be easily distinguished from phyllodes tumors by physical examination, ultrasonography, or mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Phyllodes tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phyllodes tumor (previously called cystosarcoma phyllodes) is a rare primary tumor that typically occurs in older women but has been reported in girls as young as 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].
