Behavioral, physical, and cognitive characteristics of the child and environments that are not well adapted for individuals with disabilities contribute to the increased risk.</p><p>Given the prevalence of disability among children in the United States (approximately 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], it is important that parents, caregivers, and health care providers understand the factors that increase the risk of injury and the potential strategies to minimize it. Primary care providers play a key role in improving the safety of children with disabilities through anticipatory guidance, counseling, treatment, and referral.</p><p>The epidemiology, contributing factors, and strategies to prevent unintentional and intentional injuries in children with disabilities will be reviewed here. The principles of injury control and the biologic implications of chronic conditions in childhood are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric injury prevention: Epidemiology, history, and application&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=children-and-youth-with-special-health-care-needs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Children and youth with special health care needs&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">UNINTENTIONAL INJURY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unintentional injuries are more frequent among children with disabilities than those without disabilities. In a cross-sectional survey of 7235 children in grades 6 to 10, 16 percent identified themselves as having a disability (defined by having at least one functional difficulty due to a health condition) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Students with disabilities reported more injuries than those without (67 versus 51 percent per year). They also sustained more severe injuries and required medical attention more frequently than their nondisabled peers, findings that have been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Predisposing factors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Behavioral factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with behavior disorders (eg, increased activity, impulsivity) are more likely than those without behavior disorders to engage in hazardous behaviors that may result in unintentional injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder &ndash; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is perhaps the best studied behavioral disorder with an increased risk of injury. Potential contributing factors for increased risk of injury include impulsive, hyperactive, and inattentive behaviors, as well as potentially compromised parent-child relationships (secondary to ADHD) and comorbid disorders (such as oppositional defiant disorder [ODD]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-and-prognosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Overview of treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-injurious behavior &ndash; Self-injurious behaviors, such as head-banging, biting, scratching, and hair-pulling, occur at increased rates in individuals with developmental disabilities, particularly autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Risk factors for self-injurious behavior in children with ASD include younger age, increased delay in attainment of daily living skills, and increased severity of autism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Children with ASD also are predisposed to injury because of potential concomitant intellectual disability. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Intellectual factors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other behavioral disorders &ndash; Other behavioral and emotional disorders have been associated with increased risk of injuries in some studies, but the mechanisms are not as well understood as those for ADHD. In a national cohort study, ODD was associated with an increased risk for burns and poisonings (perhaps because children with ODD may fail to heed the warnings or instructions of supervising adults); anxiety was associated with an increased risk for poisoning and head injury; and depression was associated with an increased risk of fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Intellectual factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of injury in children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities is 1.5 to 2 times that of children and adolescents without intellectual disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The types of injuries that occur with increased prevalence among children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities include burns, poisonings, foreign body injuries, fractures, dislocations, and internal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The risk of injury is particularly increased in children with intellectual disabilities and comorbid disruptive behaviors, anxiety, difficulties with social interactions, impaired communication, or ADHD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Cognitive skills that are necessary to prevent injury and that may be impaired in children with intellectual disabilities include the ability to learn and obey safety rules, accurately estimate physical abilities (eg, strength, balance), attend to and understand the risks of a given situation, and understand the cause of injury after it occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In addition to compromised hazard recognition and coping skills, children with intellectual disabilities may have concomitant physical disabilities (eg, poor gross motor skills or coordination, obesity, visual impairment) and psychopathology (ie, behavioral or emotional problems) that contribute to their increased risk of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Biologic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biologic features of certain conditions may increase the risk or severity of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Osteopenia in cerebral palsy and sensorimotor deficits in various disorders are two examples.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral palsy &ndash; Children with cerebral palsy frequently have decreased bone density (osteopenia), which increases their risk of fracture with minimal trauma. Factors that contribute to decreased bone density in children with cerebral palsy include decreased weight bearing, feeding dysfunction resulting in poor nutritional status, abnormal muscle tone, and use of anticonvulsants (which increase the catabolism of vitamin D). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and classification of cerebral palsy&quot;, section on 'Osteopenia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypocalcemia in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensorimotor deficits &ndash; Children with sensorimotor deficits (eg, myelomeningocele and other neurologic conditions) are at increased risk for burns and an increased risk of complications when burns occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary neuropathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory impairments &ndash; Children with vision and hearing impairments are at increased risk of injury, particularly when they do not use prescribed sensory aids (eg, glasses, hearing aids) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Environmental factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental factors may increase the risk of injury if the environment is not adapted to the needs of individuals with disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Environments that may require adaptation include streets, sidewalks, motor vehicles, school, and home.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transportation &ndash; Children with disabilities are at increased risk of injury during transportation, whether they are walking, riding a bicycle, using a wheelchair, or riding in a motor vehicle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a national study of almost 300 children with disabilities, the risk of vehicle-pedestrian or vehicle-bicyclist collisions was almost five times greater for children with disabilities than for those without disabilities, after adjusting for age, sex, and family income [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Collisions were more frequent among children with and without disabilities who reported traffic difficulties (eg, too <span class=\"nowrap\">few/missing</span> sidewalks, lack of knowledge of when it is safe to cross the street, <span class=\"nowrap\">insensitive/unaware</span> drivers). Children with visual and hearing impairment are at particular risk of pedestrian injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The design and performance of motor vehicle child restraint systems are regulated by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, FMVSS 213 does not take the needs of children with disabilities into account. In addition, children with disabilities may have medical conditions or treatments (eg, placement in a spica cast for hip dislocation) that preclude proper use of a conventional car seat or restraint system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Few studies have examined the risks of injury and the restraint patterns of children with disabilities traveling in motor vehicles. In an observational study, 70 percent of 115 children with special needs were unrestrained or inappropriately restrained in the private motor vehicle in which they arrived at a pediatric rehabilitation center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In another observational study, nearly three-quarters of children with special health care needs in vehicles exiting the garage at a tertiary-care children's hospital had at least one misuse of the child safety seat (eg, harnesses not in a proper location, incorrectly anchored, etc), and only 8 percent of medical equipment was properly secured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Studies exploring the risk of injury and restraint pattern among children with developmental disabilities in motor vehicle crashes revealed that, compared with children without special needs, a greater proportion of children aged 4 to 15 years with special needs likely to affect behavior (eg, ASD, intellectual disabilities) and children aged zero to eight years with special physical needs (eg, cerebral palsy) were reported by their driver to be appropriately restrained at the time of the crash. However, the risks of significant injury from the crash were similar in children with and without special needs, despite the increased usage of appropriate restraint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Environmental risk factors related to injury among children who use motorized wheelchairs include traffic patterns, the condition of the wheelchair, whether it is properly adjusted and maintained, and whether items (such as knapsacks) are placed on the back of the chair (thereby altering the center of gravity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/16,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,28,29</a>]. Host risk factors include younger age, male sex, and paraplegia or spina bifida.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Wheelchair securement and standards for special education school buses have been incorporated into national recommendations (FMVSS 222 and Twelfth National Standards Conference on School Transportation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Wheelchairs themselves, however, are not subject to mandatory crash-testing requirements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Child care and school &ndash; Young children with disabilities have higher rates of injuries in child care settings than do children without disabilities (4.8 versus 2.5 injuries per child per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. School-age children and adolescents with disabilities sustain approximately one-fifth of all school-related injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A review of data from pupil accident reports and school records describes the epidemiology of school-related injury in a large cohort of students from 17 special education schools in an urban school district [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The overall rate of injury was 4.7 per 100 students per year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most injuries occurred on the playground and during organized play.

The most common site of injury was the face.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After adjusting for age, sex, school, and year of enrollment, children with multiple disabilities had the highest rates of injuries (odds ratio [OR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.3).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Home &ndash; Individuals with a physical or cognitive disability have a two- to six-times higher risk of dying in a house fire compared with the risk of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Physical disability may impede an individual's ability to successfully execute an escape plan without help. Cognitive disabilities may impede an individual's awareness of the danger <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the ability to implement the escape plan. Impaired physical and cognitive abilities also may increase the risk of drowning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elopement &ndash; Among individuals receiving developmental disabilities services, the prevalence of elopement (or repeated attempts to leave designated areas without permission) is approximately 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Children may elope from school or home. Elopement can lead children into life-threatening situations (eg, street traffic). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of elopement'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Elopement in children with ASD is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-management#H250887805\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Routine care'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of unintentional injury</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The declining rate of unintentional injuries among the general pediatric population suggests that injury prevention strategies have been effective. However, there is no central database tracking injuries among children with disabilities. General prevention strategies that are effective for all children should be strongly encouraged for families of children with disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric injury prevention: Epidemiology, history, and application&quot;, section on 'Principles of injury prevention and control'</a>.)</p><p>The most effective injury prevention strategies for all children are &quot;passive interventions&quot;: those that do not require action by the child or parent (eg, guardrails, child-proof containers, air bags). Health care providers also should promote &quot;active interventions,&quot; such as car safety restraint, smoke detectors, and bicycle helmets. For risky or self-injurious behaviors that cannot be managed with these general strategies, referral to a developmental pediatrician <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> behavioral psychologist may be warranted.</p><p>In addition to anticipatory guidance regarding general injury prevention strategies, primary care providers should tailor injury prevention advice to the patient's disability. As an example, parents of children with ADHD should be educated about the increased risk of injury in their children and the need for protective gear in certain situations (eg, bicycle helmets). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bicycle injuries in children: Prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-and-prognosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Overview of treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>To the extent that interventions are available, primary care clinicians also should provide interventions to address the biologic factors that increase their patients' risk of injury (eg, physical therapy, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation in children at risk for osteopenia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and classification of cerebral palsy&quot;, section on 'Osteopenia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Safe transportation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Promotion of awareness of the potential risk of injury during transportation is the first step in the prevention of such injuries.</p><p>Conventional restraint systems usually meet the safety needs of the child when the disability does not significantly impair muscle tone, posture, or breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Older children with challenging behavior (eg, ADHD, ASD, or emotional problems) may require a safety restraint system that is less likely to be unbuckled by the child (eg, vests with rear back closure, high-back booster seats with internal harnesses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>General guidelines for safe transportation of infants and young children with disabilities are provided in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57499\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57499 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Tethers, additional lap seat belts, or appropriate tie-down systems may be necessary. A special-needs belt-positioning booster seat or conventional belt-positioning booster seat can ensure proper positioning of the lap and shoulder belts (lap belts should be positioned low and flat across the child's hips; shoulder belts should be snug across the child's chest). The shoulder belt should not be placed underneath the child's arms or behind the child's back.</p><p>Consultation with child passenger safety technicians may be helpful for children with disabilities that affect motor tone, posture, or breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].
