Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency because it may result in life-threatening infant injuries, as well as less serious maternal injuries. It has been estimated that one newborn with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy due to shoulder dystocia is born in every 22,000 term vaginal births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss antepartum issues related to shoulder dystocia: risk factors for the disorder and planning delivery when these risk factors are identified before labor. However, since many shoulder dystocias occur in pregnancies without risk factors, clinicians should always be prepared for the occurrence of the disorder. Intrapartum issues, including pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and outcome of shoulder dystocia are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder dystocia: Intrapartum diagnosis, management, and outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAN SHOULDER DYSTOCIA BE PREDICTED?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The occurrence of shoulder dystocia cannot be accurately predicted by antenatal or intrapartum risk factors or imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Since at least 50 percent of pregnancies complicated by shoulder dystocia have no identifiable risk factors, the predictive value of any one or combination of risk factors for shoulder dystocia is low (less than 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Therefore, all obstetric care providers should be able to (1) promptly recognize when gentle traction alone is inadequate for delivery of the shoulders and (2) proceed through an orderly sequence of maneuvers to deliver the neonate in a timely manner, with no or minimal maternal and fetal trauma.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that permanent birth injury, and even perinatal death, can occur in cases of shoulder dystocia that are appropriately identified and managed. Furthermore, neonatal brachial plexus palsy can occur in infants delivered by cesarean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1000006373\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High birth weight is the major risk factor for shoulder dystocia. Although other risk factors have also been associated with shoulder dystocia, they are often related to high birth weight. The increasing prevalence of risk factors such as maternal obesity, diabetes, and older age at first birth may be associated with an increased prevalence of shoulder dystocia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1319924659\"><span class=\"h2\">Antepartum</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">High birth weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of shoulder dystocia increases progressively as birth weight increases over 4000 g (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75719\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75719 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/3,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9-12</a>], and morbidity and mortality from shoulder dystocia increase significantly when birth weight is &ge;4500 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Sonographic estimation of fetal weight does not accurately detect or exclude macrosomia. Clinical estimates of birth weight based upon palpation using Leopold's maneuvers are also insensitive.

This increase is due, in part, to the higher prevalence of high birth weight in women with diabetes compared with nondiabetic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16</a>]. In addition, the anthropomorphic measurements of infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) are different from those in offspring of women without diabetes. Specifically, the chest-to-head and shoulder-to-head ratios are increased in IDMs, thereby increasing the risk of shoulder dystocia independent of fetal weight and at weights &lt;4000 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Of note, even a single abnormal glucose value in a 75 g two-hour glucose tolerance test is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome, including macrosomia and shoulder dystocia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

This may be an underestimate of the true recurrence risk in the absence of intervention as many patients and clinicians choose an abdominal delivery in pregnancies subsequent to an episode of shoulder dystocia and thus avoid recurrence.</p><p>Recurrence is not surprising since high birth weight is a major risk factor for shoulder dystocia and tends to recur. In one study, one-third of non-diabetic women with newborns &ge;4500 g at their first delivery also had newborns this large at their second delivery, whereas only 0.3 percent of women with a normal weight infant (3000 to 3500 g) at their first delivery had an infant weighing &ge;4500 g in their second delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Recurrent shoulder dystocia is more likely in women with [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepregnancy weight greater than in the index pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational weight gain greater than in the index pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth weight greater than in the index pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth weight &gt;4000 g</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second stage of labor longer than in the index pregnancy</p><p/><p>The combination of a previous shoulder dystocia and high birth weight is particularly worrisome.

In a retrospective cohort study including all women in Norway with two consecutive singleton vaginal deliveries during 1967 to 2005 (n = 537,316 women), 96 percent of cases of shoulder dystocia in the second delivery were in women without a previous history of the complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Postterm pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postterm pregnancy is a risk factor for shoulder dystocia, presumably because of higher birth weights with advancing gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a cohort study of term (n = 379,445) and postterm (n = 65,796) births from Norway, the relative risk of shoulder dystocia in postterm births was increased by 30 percent (relative risk [RR] 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. An increased prevalence of high birth weight was primarily responsible for the increased risk of shoulder dystocia because the difference was not apparent after stratification by birth weight. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postterm-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postterm pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Male fetal gender</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Male gender is more common in pregnancies complicated by shoulder dystocia than in the overall birth population (55 to 68 percent versus 51 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/4,9,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,32</a>]. Higher birth weights among males likely contribute, at least in part, to this finding.

Anthropomorphic dimensions may also account for some of the increased risk of shoulder dystocia among males, similar to findings in IDMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Maternal obesity and high gestational weight gain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High maternal body mass index (BMI) and excessive gestational weight gain are risk factors for both high birth weight and diabetes, which are also risk factors for shoulder dystocia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

Increased maternal age is also associated with increased parity, which may be another confounding factor since each successive infant tends to be 200 g larger than the prior one up to the fifth pregnancy. In the United States, African American women appear to be at higher risk of shoulder dystocia than Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1660886038\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvimetry and fetal biometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all shoulder dystocias occur in women with normal pelvic dimensions; therefore, imaging studies (radiograph, computed tomography, ultrasound) and clinical pelvimetry are not useful for identifying women at increased risk, except in rare cases of a severe fetal or pelvic abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/9,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,36</a>].</p><p>Several fetal biometric parameters (eg, difference between the fetal abdominal and biparietal diameters, chest circumference, humerospinous distance, cheek-to-cheek diameter, shoulder width) have been used to predict shoulder dystocia, primarily in fetuses of diabetic gravidas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>].

Labor abnormalities alone are not useful predictors of shoulder dystocia due to the high frequency of labor abnormalities in the general obstetrical population and the relatively low frequency of shoulder dystocia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>The combination of labor abnormalities, suspected high birth weight (&gt;4000 g), and operative vaginal delivery appears be more predictive of shoulder dystocia than labor abnormalities alone.

A meta-analysis did not find a significant difference in the risk of shoulder dystocia between the use of vacuum and forceps (odds ratio 1.11, 95% CI 0.25-4.89; four studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Widely inconsistent results among the studies may be explained by the fact that the choice of vacuum versus forceps depends in part on the clinical setting, and some clinical settings are associated with a higher risk of shoulder dystocia than others. Operator expertise with each instrument may be another factor. The only randomized trial of obstetric forceps versus the M-cup vacuum extractor found a higher risk of shoulder dystocia with the use of a vacuum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Dietary and physical activity-based interventions also have other health benefits and are not harmful. A meta-analysis of randomized trials reported that such interventions reduced the overall risk of shoulder dystocia (relative risk 0.39, 95% CI 0.22-0.70; four trials, n = 2317) compared with usual care, but the difference was not statistically significant when women with diabetes were excluded from the analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

Similarly, there is general consensus favoring a trial of labor when the risk of shoulder dystocia is very low, such as for a multiparous woman without a history of difficult vaginal birth in spontaneous labor at 39 weeks of gestation and an estimated fetal weight under 4000 g. However, most clinical settings fall into gray areas since at least 50 percent of pregnancies complicated by shoulder dystocia have no identifiable risk factors and most risk factors are weakly predictive of morbidity from shoulder dystocia. For this reason, the author believes that all pregnant women should receive nondirective counseling about the risks of labor and vaginal birth, including a discussion about shoulder dystocia.

Although this will prevent some shoulder dystocias and their associated complications, most cases of shoulder dystocia, including those that will result in neonatal injury, cannot be predicted before delivery and thus they cannot be prevented, as discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Can shoulder dystocia be predicted?'</a> above.)</p><p>We consider the following clinical situations as particularly high risk for shoulder dystocia and brachial plexus injury, in agreement with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/2,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,60,61</a>].

In women with diabetes, a decision-analysis model estimated that 443 cesarean deliveries would need to be performed at the &gt;4500 g weight threshold to prevent one permanent brachial plexus injury; other adverse outcomes of shoulder dystocia were not considered in the analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The model found the 4500 g threshold was much less beneficial in nondiabetic women, as 3695 cesarean deliveries would need to be performed to prevent one permanent brachial plexus injury. In women without diabetes, a 5000 g threshold for cesarean delivery is reasonable as it is estimated to prevent at least 20 percent of shoulder dystocias with minimal effect on the total cesarean delivery rate, which is already 50 to 60 percent for infants at this birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. This approach might also prevent those shoulder dystocias with the highest risk of severe morbidity since the risk of permanent brachial plexus injury in shoulder dystocia appears to be related to birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1257169052\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for intrapartum cesarean delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with estimated fetal weights &gt;4000 g and &lt;4500 g (diabetics) or &lt;5000 g (nondiabetics) undergoing a trial of labor become high risk for shoulder intrapartum if they have a prolonged second stage and need an operative vaginal delivery (see <a href=\"#H430641083\" class=\"local\">'Intrapartum'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'High birth weight'</a> above). The principle of cesarean delivery to prevent morbidity from shoulder dystocia also applies in this setting.

We suggest intrapartum cesarean delivery rather than a midpelvic operative vaginal delivery when the estimated weight &gt;4000 g.

Although logical, concerns have been raised about the limitations of ultrasound estimated fetal weight, the number of inductions that would need to be performed to prevent on adverse outcome, the maternal and neonatal consequences of induction, and the lack of evidence establishing the effectiveness of this approach.</p><p>Our approach is described below and differs from that of ACOG, which discourages induction of labor for suspected macrosomia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. ACOG recommends against induction before 39 weeks unless medically indicated and opines that more data are needed to determine whether induction is better than expectant management for suspected large for gestational age infants and to determine at what gestational age induction should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1593965396\"><span class=\"h3\">Women without diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We believe that it is reasonable to offer elective induction of labor to women at 39 weeks of gestation without diabetes and with estimated fetal weight between 4000 and 4500 g, but expectant management is also reasonable, given limited data indicating benefit. The potential reduction in shoulder dystocia and its sequelae with induction at 39 weeks is likely to be less than with induction at 37 or 38 weeks, but common neonatal morbidities such as hyperbilirubinemia and respiratory problems are likely to be higher with induction at 37 or 38 weeks. Further trials of early term induction for suspected fetal macrosomia are needed to refine the optimum gestational age and estimated fetal weight for induction. ACOG recommends against induction of labor for a suspected large for gestational age infant at any gestational age because of insufficient data to support the maternal or neonatal benefit of intervention over expectant management and the lack of data to inform the gestational age at which delivery should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>In a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of labor induction versus expectant management in pregnancies with suspected macrosomia at 37 to 40 weeks of gestation (four randomized trials, n = 1190 primarily non-diabetic women [some women treated with nutritional therapy alone were included]), induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced the risk of neonatal fractures (relative risk [RR] 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.79)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced the risk of shoulder dystocia (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37-0.98) </p><p/><p>The number of inductions needed per fracture prevented was 60. The only two brachial plexus injuries were in the expectant management group, but the number of patients in the trials was too small and power was insufficient to determine whether this difference was clinically significant. The authors also noted that a policy of labor induction for suspected macrosomia at or near term did not result in higher rates of cesarean or instrumental deliveries, but did lead to a higher incidence of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears. Although the trials could not be blinded to either staff or patients, risk of bias was deemed to be low.</p><p>Available data have several limitations that preclude a strong recommendation in favor of induction. For example, the definition of suspected macrosomia varied among the trials: in two trials pregnancies were included when fetal weight, estimated by ultrasound examination, was between 4000 g and 4500 g or between 4000 g and 4750 g, the third trial included pregnancies with estimated fetal weight more than the 97<sup>th</sup> percentile at the time of inclusion, and the fourth trial included pregnancies with estimated fetal weight more than the 95<sup>th</sup> centile. In addition, induction was performed at 37 to 40 weeks; therefore, it is unknown whether induction at 39 weeks (the preferred minimum age for induction to minimize risk of respiratory problems) would still be effective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2710599016\"><span class=\"h3\">Women with diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women with pregestational diabetes, timing of delivery is based primarily on the maternal and perinatal risks associated with the disease rather than concerns about shoulder dystocia alone.
