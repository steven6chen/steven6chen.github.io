Although the impact of PAS on pregnancy outcomes is well described, no randomized trials and few studies have examined the management of pregnancies complicated by this disorder. As a result, recommendations for its management are based on case series and reports, personal experience, expert opinion, and good clinical judgment.</p><p>The management of placenta accreta, increta, and percreta will be discussed here and is essentially the same, except when a percreta extends to extrauterine tissue. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion of management of PAS applies to all depths of placental invasion. The clinical features and diagnosis of PAS are reviewed separately.

However, a sonogram late in gestation can precisely locate the placenta and help to assess the likelihood of bladder involvement. This information is useful for surgical planning and delivery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1320687\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION FOR DELIVERY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1320695\"><span class=\"h2\">Components of preoperative planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is critical to develop a plan preoperatively for managing women with a high likelihood of PAS. The goal is to provide information (informed consent) and plan interventions that will reduce the risk of massive hemorrhage, as well as its substantial morbidity and potential mortality. Cesarean hysterectomy is usually performed because the placenta cannot be removed in any other way and, if left in situ, subinvolution often results in postpartum hemorrhage.</p><p>Specific components of preoperative planning and care that should be addressed include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Informed consent</strong> &ndash; Discussion of potential intraoperative complications and interventions (eg, severe hemorrhage, blood transfusion, injury to or partial resection of bladder and bowel, hysterectomy to control bleeding, risk of postoperative vesico-vaginal fistula). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multidisciplinary care team</strong> &ndash; Management by a multidisciplinary team and delivery in a tertiary care facility improve outcomes and lower complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. We schedule a multidisciplinary conference with all the key care participants at least two weeks prior to planned delivery to ensure that all necessary preparations are completed and management plans implemented. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The multidisciplinary team includes maternal-fetal medicine specialists, anesthesiologists, neonatologists, interventional radiologists, and blood bank and nursing personnel. It is desirable to have a surgeon in the operating room who has extensive experience with wide dissection of the parametrium and exploration of the retroperitoneum in the event this expertise is required for control of bleeding, bladder resection, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> isolation, partial resection, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reimplantation of the ureters. Some obstetrician-gynecologists have this experience; general surgeons, urologists, and vascular surgeons also have expertise in this area. A urogynecologist, urologist, or gynecologic oncologist should be consulted in cases where there is expected bladder involvement or if the surgeon does not have the requisite surgical expertise. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If an appropriate multidisciplinary team and support services are not available at the site the patient plans delivery, she should be transferred to a tertiary facility that has the capability to most effectively manage major intraoperative hemorrhage and provide postoperative intensive care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scheduled delivery</strong> &ndash; Delivery should be scheduled for optimal availability of necessary personnel and facilities.

Although many small series and case reports have reported use of catheters resulted in significantly less blood loss, lower blood transfusion requirements, and shorter duration of surgery, other small series, case reports, and a small randomized trial have not documented significant benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].

Patients should be informed of the possible risks of balloon catheter use when the technique is employed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Planning</strong> &mdash; If prophylactic embolization is planned and appropriate facilities are available, the patient should undergo delivery on a fluoroscopy table so arterial embolization can be performed intraoperatively immediately after delivery of the infant, thus eliminating the need to close and reopen the abdomen and transfer the patient back and forth from the radiology department. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Procedure</strong> &mdash; Preoperatively under fluoroscopic guidance, an angiographer inserts a balloon catheter into each femoral artery and guides the catheters into the internal iliac arteries. After delivery of the newborn, the balloons can be inflated intermittently for up to 20 minutes to reduce bleeding in the operative field, which facilitates placement of clamps and sutures and, in our experience, markedly decreases total blood loss. Use of a pressure manometer-endoflator allows inflation and deflation of the balloons to pressure without the use of fluoroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The catheters may be left in situ for several hours postoperatively, and then used for selective embolization of small pelvic vessels if postoperative bleeding occurs. They are removed under fluoroscopic guidance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a modification of this standard approach, the balloon-tipped catheters are placed before surgery, but the uterine and abdominal incisions are closed after the infant is delivered, and the patient is transferred to the angiography unit for embolization of the uteroplacental bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The patient is then immediately returned to the operating room for hysterectomy. In eight cases in which this staged procedure was utilized, blood loss was significantly less than that in patients undergoing hysterectomy without embolization (mean 553 mL versus 4517 mL). This approach requires further study to determine safety and efficacy compared with the standard approach. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1320723\"><span class=\"h1\">DELIVERY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2330472772\"><span class=\"h2\">Unscheduled</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A substantial percentage of patients develop complications, such as preterm premature rupture of membranes, preterm labor, or antepartum bleeding, leading to delivery earlier than planned.

This is consistent with a Committee Opinion of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [].</p><p>The prolonged course and significant risks of uterine conservation with the placenta left in situ were illustrated by a systematic review of 10 cohort studies and 50 case series or case reports describing 434 patients with placenta accreta, increta, or percreta managed conservatively (expectant management, uterine artery embolization, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> therapy, hemostatic sutures, arterial ligation, balloon tamponade) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The following short-term outcomes were reported, but data were not available for all outcomes in all studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe vaginal bleeding: 53 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis: 6 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary hysterectomy: 19 percent (range 6 to 31 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Death: 0.3 percent (range 0 to 4 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequent pregnancy: 67 percent (range 15 to 73 percent)</p><p/><p>In the largest study, which included 167 women with placenta accreta managed conservatively using a variety of modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], 131 women (78 percent) retained their uterus, 18 women required hysterectomy within 24 hours of delivery because of hemorrhage, and 18 women underwent hysterectomy because of complications at a median 39 days after delivery (range 9 to 105 days). Ten women experienced severe morbidity, including sepsis, vesicouterine fistula, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> uterine necrosis. In women who retained their uterus, placental resorption was observed on follow-up at a median of 13.5 weeks (range 4 to 60 weeks). However, 25 percent of these women underwent hysteroscopy, curettage, or both to remove retained placental tissue at a median of 20 weeks postpartum (range 2 to 45 weeks). </p><p>Long-term reproductive outcomes following conservative management appear to be suboptimal, but data are limited []. Although there appears to be an increased risk of developing intrauterine synechiae, most women who desire another pregnancy are able to conceive and are at increased risk of recurrent placenta accreta. This is expected since the underlying abnormality of the endometrium has not been corrected and can be worsened by postpartum curettage. A retrospective multicenter study of 96 women with a history of conservative management of placenta accreta (ie, uterine preservation) observed that 8 had severe intrauterine synechiae and were amenorrheic []. In three cases series with 9, 21, and 30 deliveries after conservative management of placenta accreta, recurrent placenta accreta was noted in 12 of the 60 subsequent deliveries (20 percent, range 13 to 29 percent) []. </p><p>Another consideration is that it is not possible to be certain that women undergoing conservative management truly had morbidly adherent placenta since they do not have histologic confirmation after hysterectomy. These women may comprise a different population at less risk for serious bleeding than women requiring hysterectomy. For example, cases of morbidly adherent placenta managed conservatively had lower rates of prior cesarean delivery and previa than those managed with hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta/abstract/3,4,30,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,30,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1822804163\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine conservation with placental resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine conservation with placental resection may be successful without excessive risk in two clinical settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Focal accreta</strong> &ndash; Focal accreta may be suspected on the basis of imaging findings antepartum, or detected intrapartum because of hemorrhage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a partially retained placenta at delivery. There are a few reports describing cases of successful uterine conservation in these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Potential candidates for this approach are women with a clearly delineated, focal area of morbidly adherent placenta and an accessible border of healthy myometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Management involves oversewing the bleeding sites or removing a small wedge of uterine tissue containing the focally adherent placenta (placental-myometrial en bloc excision and repair).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another approach to uterine conservation with placental resection is the triple P procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This involves pelvic devascularization as well as removal of part of the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. It has only been reported in a small number of cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fundal or posterior placenta accreta</strong> &ndash; In contrast to anterior placenta accreta, the authors&rsquo; experience is that uterine conservation may be possible for a posterior or fundal accreta, since bleeding after removal of placenta accreta in these locations is more readily controlled medically, with interventional radiology, and with conservative surgery. The option for a (relatively) easy hysterectomy is still available if bleeding cannot be adequately controlled by these other measures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864461153\"><span class=\"h1\">UNEXPECTED PLACENTA ACCRETA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some cases of placenta accreta are first recognized at delivery, typically repeat cesarean delivery. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, the surgeon may see placental tissue invading the lower uterine segment or bladder, tortuous vascularity along the uterine serosa, or a markedly distended lower uterine segment bulging toward the pelvic sidewalls. It is important to avoid or minimize manipulation of the uterus or sites of possible extrauterine placental extension as this can precipitate life-threatening hemorrhage. </p><p>We agree with an expert review that suggested the following approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. If the patient is not bleeding heavily, mother and fetus are stable, and resources for managing these complicated cases are not immediately available, the uterus can be covered with warm packs and further surgery delayed until appropriate personnel and other resources are available. If assembling these resources is not possible locally, the abdomen should be closed and the patient expeditiously transferred to a facility that can manage these patients, although the risk of massive hemorrhage in transit must be considered.</p><p>Delivery of a compromised fetus through a hysterotomy far from the placenta, followed by closure of the hysterotomy with the placenta left undisturbed, is an option until appropriate personnel and resources for maternal care are available. Intraoperative ultrasound using a probe with a sterile cover can indicate the placental location. If there is no time for ultrasound examination, in most cases a hysterotomy in the posterior uterus or fundus will avoid the placenta.</p><p>Women who are bleeding heavily or otherwise unstable need to be managed as optimally as allowed by the clinical setting and available resources. This includes resuscitation with fluid and blood products, standard surgical procedures for controlling hemorrhage, and pressure on bleeding sites (digital, abdominopelvic packs); infrarenal aortic compression or aortic cross-clamping can be used in an attempt to control life-threatening hemorrhage. Direct pressure on a percreta should be avoided or applied cautiously as it may increase the size of the bleeding area. A massive transfusion protocol is useful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F91236\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91236 \">algorithm 1</a>). Intraoperative management of women with massive hemorrhage at cesarean delivery is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Management approaches requiring laparotomy&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of the abdomen'</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, a focal or complete placenta accreta is first recognized at the time of manual removal of a retained placenta after vaginal delivery. In these cases, there is no plane of dissection between the uterus and placenta and attempts at manual removal may lead to life-threatening hemorrhage. These patients should receive fluids and transfusion, as appropriate, while being prepared for laparotomy and surgical management, as described above. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864460986\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intensive care unit bed should be available for postoperative care, if needed. These patients may require ventilator support due to pulmonary edema from massive fluid resuscitation or fluid shifts, or from acute transfusion-related lung injury []. Some patients need vasopressor support and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Postoperative bleeding may occur, and the availability of interventional radiology to provide angiographic embolization of deep pelvic vessels, thus avoiding reoperation, can safely enhance patient care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=critical-illness-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Critical illness during pregnancy and the peripartum period&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1320787\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is critical to develop a plan preoperatively for managing women with a high likelihood of PAS. The plan should involve a multidisciplinary team and scheduled delivery in a facility with resources and personnel to manage massive hemorrhage and complicated pelvic surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1320695\" class=\"local\">'Components of preoperative planning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the risks of massive hemorrhage during attempted placental removal if accreta is present, we believe that recommending a cesarean hysterectomy based on imaging findings is the most reasonable and safest approach to management. We suggest scheduling cesarean hysterectomy and leaving the placenta undisturbed in situ (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1320723\" class=\"local\">'Delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach is to plan delivery between 34 and 35 weeks of gestation in stable patients. We schedule the procedure at a facility with personnel experienced in managing pelvic hemorrhage and its complications. (See <a href=\"#H1320723\" class=\"local\">'Delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antenatal corticosteroids are administered according to standard guidelines.

The catheters may be inflated intermittently during hysterectomy, thus potentially decreasing blood loss and providing optimum exposure of the operative field. They may also be used for embolization of persistent bleeding. Potential risks and benefits of catheter placement should be discussed with the patient. (See <a href=\"#H1320709\" class=\"local\">'Balloon catheterization and arterial embolization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In rare situations, uterine conservation may be attempted if future childbearing is desired and after extensive counseling regarding risks.
