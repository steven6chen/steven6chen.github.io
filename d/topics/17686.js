ASPD is usually a lifelong disorder that begins in childhood and is fully manifest by the late 20s or early 30s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antisocial-personality-disorder/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Typical behaviors include criminality and failure to conform to the law, failure to sustain consistent employment, manipulation of others for personal gain, and failure to develop stable interpersonal relationships. Other features of ASPD include lacking empathy for others, rarely experiencing remorse, and failing to learn from the negative results of one&rsquo;s experiences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antisocial-personality-disorder/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>This topic describes treatment for antisocial personality disorder. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder are discussed separately.

No medications have been found to be efficacious in the treatment of ASPD. Medications may be useful in the treatment of severe aggressive behavior in patients with ASPD. (See <a href=\"#H2291953\" class=\"local\">'Aggressive behavior in ASPD'</a> below.)</p><p>Medication may also be appropriate to treat a comorbid psychiatric disorder in persons with ASPD, although medications with abuse potential should be avoided when possible.

It is possible, however, that CBT may benefit those with milder forms of the disorder (eg, not physically dangerous) and who possess some insight and reason to improve. Examples of the latter would be patients who risk losing a spouse or job if their behavior were not controlled. Psychoanalysis or psychodynamic therapy were historically preferred approaches to treating ASPD, but these gradually have given way to CBT, which has been adapted from models developed for depression and anxiety disorders. (See <a href=\"#H1429165\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>Antisocial persons often possess traits that actively interfere with the process of psychotherapy and make working with them difficult (eg, impulsivity, blaming others) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antisocial-personality-disorder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. No matter how determined the therapist may be to help an antisocial patient, it is possible that the patient&rsquo;s criminal past, irresponsibility, and tendency toward violence may render him thoroughly unlikable. For that reason, many therapists will find it difficult, if not impossible to work with such a patient.

The best prospects for treatment come with mental health professionals experienced in treating ASPD who are able to anticipate their emotions and to present an attitude of acceptance tempered with the need to set limits and confront manipulative behaviors without moralizing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antisocial-personality-disorder/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Psychotherapy may be ineffective or even harmful when provided to persons with psychopathy or severe ASPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antisocial-personality-disorder/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. One perspective is that the rigid personality structure of these individuals generally resists outside influence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antisocial-personality-disorder/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], observing that in therapy, many often simply go through the motions, and may even learn skills that help them better manipulate others. This concern is particularly pronounced for group therapy.

The therapist focuses on evaluating situations in which the patient&rsquo;s distorted beliefs and attitudes may have interfered with interpersonal functioning or in achieving goals. Once the patient has gained an understanding of how he has contributed to his own problems, the therapist can help him or her to gradually make sensible changes in thinking and behavior. Guidelines are set for the patient&rsquo;s involvement, including regular attendance, active participation, and completion of homework outside of office visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antisocial-personality-disorder/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].<sup> </sup></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1429165\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two clinical trials of CBT for ASPD have been negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-antisocial-personality-disorder/abstract/6,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,30-32</a>].
