However, these tools have drawbacks and inaccuracies. Thus, several, less invasive, novel technologies are available or being investigated for use to assess parameters such as cardiac output, intravascular volume status, responsiveness to intravenous fluid administration, and tissue perfusion. They can potentially be used in the emergency department, intensive care unit, and operating room when caring for patients with shock or hypovolemia. </p><p>This topic will discuss novel techniques for hemodynamic monitoring. The evaluation and treatment of shock, central venous pressure and PAC monitoring are discussed separately.

However, several studies have demonstrated that the PAC fails to improve outcome in critically ill patients and may be associated with harm. In the late 1990s central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring via central venous catheterization (CVC) emerged as a less invasive alternative that was incorporated into guideline management of sepsis; however, this practice has also been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

First, many of these tools use proprietary algorithms or imaging technology, making it difficult to confirm their validity. Second, some devices produce data that still require complex interpretation which can be challenging even for expert clinicians. Third, no large randomized trials of resuscitation guided by noninvasive hemodynamic monitors have been conducted. When studied, many of these devices were compared against PACs as the &quot;gold standard,&quot; which, as a less than perfect tool itself, may explain why no study has conclusively demonstrated that use of these devices improves clinically meaningful outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H977257693\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic principles</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1590583545\"><span class=\"h3\">Upstream versus downstream monitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A greater understanding of tissue and cellular hypoxia as a cardinal feature of shock has led to the concept of &quot;upstream&quot; and &quot;downstream&quot; indicators of organ perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upstream</strong> &ndash; &quot;Upstream&quot; (&quot;macro&quot;) markers assess flow and pressure in the heart, vena cava, pulmonary artery, and aorta and are the traditional variables that have been used to assess the hemodynamic status of critically ill patients.

Tools have been developed that follow alterations in tissue oxygenation and microvascular blood flow. These techniques are known as the &quot;downstream&quot; (or &quot;micro&quot;) markers of resuscitation. (See <a href=\"#H3072527454\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of tissue oxygen saturation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4096645981\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of microcirculatory blood flow'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2641675371\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart-lung interaction during mechanical ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying physiologic principle common to a number of the monitoring tools discussed in this topic is the heart-lung interaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. During the inspiratory phase of positive pressure ventilation, intrathoracic pressure increases, passively increasing right atrial pressure, causing venous return to decrease and the vena cava to distend. If both the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) are fluid responsive, this leads to decreased RV output and, after two or three heartbeats, decreased LV output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In preload-dependent patients, cyclic changes in LV stroke volume (SV) and its coupled arterial pulse pressure are seen, and the magnitude of the changes is proportional to volume responsiveness. The inverse is true during spontaneous negative pressure breathing, though this has not been well-studied. (See <a href=\"#H4126637658\" class=\"local\">'Pulse contour analysis (fluid responsiveness)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2534061152\"><span class=\"h1\">VOLUME STATUS AND FLUID RESPONSIVENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The devices listed in this section rely on the principles that underlie the heart-lung interaction during mechanical ventilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> visually assess flow in the heart and major vessels (ie &quot;upstream&quot; monitors).

Variation in pulse pressure is thought to be an indicator of a patient's position on the Frank-Starling Curve, a curve that denotes a patient's response to pre-load (ie, fluid responsiveness) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F109405\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109405 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients operating on the flat part of the curve are insensitive to changes in preload induced by mechanical ventilation and thus have a low variation in the pulse pressure, indicating a lack of fluid responsiveness. In contrast, patients operating on the steep portion of the curve, are sensitive to changes to cyclic changes in preload induced by mechanical ventilation and hence, exhibit greater variation in the pulse pressure (ie, fluid responsive).</p><p>Numerous studies have demonstrated that a PPV of at least 13 to 15 percent is strongly associated with volume responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock/abstract/4,12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,14</a>]. As an example, one systematic review of 29 studies reported a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for PPV compared with CVP (0.94 versus 0.55) as an indicator of fluid responsiveness (sensitivity and specificity were 0.88 each) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>PPV is typically calculated as the ratio of the maximum pulse pressure (systolic blood pressure minus diastolic blood pressure; PPmax) minus the minimum pulse pressure (PPmin) to the mean pulse pressure (PPmean), usually averaged over three or more breaths. Although it can be measured from pressures derived from manual cuff-inflation, measurements are generally more accurate when an arterial catheter is used such that the latter is preferred (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F109406\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109406 \">figure 2</a>):</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>PPV = 100 x (PP<sub>max </sub>&ndash; PP<sub>min</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">)/PP<sub>mean</sub></span></p></div></div><p>A number of commercially available devices and monitors capable of measuring PPV exist, and several use complex proprietary algorithms to additionally calculate stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO). &#160;</p><p>While encouraging, this technique is limited to patients who are mechanically ventilated, receiving &ge;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of tidal volume, in sinus rhythm, and <strong>not</strong> spontaneously triggering the ventilator, factors that limit its general applicability in the intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, sensitivity for volume responsiveness is decreased in patients ventilated with tidal volumes of &le;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> as the cyclic changes induced by mechanical ventilation are less pronounced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although patients with intra-abdominal hypertension often have markedly abnormal respiratory system compliance, PPV is thought to be accurate in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2562822490\"><span class=\"h3\">Stroke volume variation (SVV)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SV is linearly related to pulse pressure. SVV functions on the same physiologic principle as PPV (see <a href=\"#H848751763\" class=\"local\">'Pulse pressure variation (PPV)'</a> above). Studies have consistently found that SVV &gt;10 percent is associated with fluid responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock/abstract/11,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17-20</a>].

SVV is typically measured by several commercially available devices. SVV can also be determined by measuring aortic blood flow velocity using esophageal Doppler, bioimpedance, and bioreactance technology, which are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1190957363\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic electrical bioimpedance or bioreactance'</a> below.)</p><p>SVV has the same limitations as PPV (see <a href=\"#H848751763\" class=\"local\">'Pulse pressure variation (PPV)'</a> above). Although there is evidence that suggests that SVV may also be applied to spontaneously breathing patients, this has not been validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patient position may also affect SVV accuracy. In one study, the 30 degree head-up and prone positions were associated with increased SVV because of the associated decreased SV associated with these positions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].
