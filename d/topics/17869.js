Seizures may indicate the presence of a potentially treatable etiology and should prompt an immediate evaluation to determine cause and to institute etiology-specific therapy. In addition, seizures themselves may require emergent therapy, since they can adversely affect the infant's homeostasis or they may contribute to further brain injury. Some types of neonatal seizures are associated with a relatively high incidence of early death and, in survivors, a high incidence of neurologic impairment, developmental delay, and postneonatal epilepsy.</p><p>Management of neonatal seizures involves accurate diagnosis of seizures, expedited evaluation and targeted treatment for their etiology, and medication to abolish the electrographic seizures. This topic will discuss the approach to treatment of neonatal seizures. The etiology, clinical features and diagnosis of neonatal seizures are discussed separately.

This is particularly true for seizures associated with some metabolic disturbances (eg, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and with central nervous system (CNS) or systemic infections. Furthermore, neonatal seizures may not be effectively controlled with antiseizure drugs unless their underlying cause is treated.</p><p>The most common etiologies of neonatal seizures are reviewed in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73867\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73867 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal encephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal encephalopathy (and associated hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) is the most common cause of neonatal seizures.

Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">calcium chloride</a> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ml/kg)</span> can be given.

The treatment is 50 percent solution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">magnesium sulfate</a> given by intramuscular injection at 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> or 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>.

It is important to recognize such disorders early, since cofactor or vitamin supplementation and other disease-modifying therapies are available for some. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-prognosis-of-neonatal-seizures#H369915303\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and prognosis of neonatal seizures&quot;, section on 'Inborn errors of metabolism'</a>.)</p><p>In particular, pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) due to antiquitin (ATQ) deficiency and the related disorder, pyridoxamine 5&rsquo;-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) deficiency, are rare but treatable genetic causes of medically refractory neonatal seizures. The approach to recognition and treatment of PDE is summarized in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97078\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97078 \">algorithm 1</a>). Sequential therapeutic trials of pyridoxine (100 mg IV injections, repeated every 5 to 15 minutes up to a maximum of 500 mg with continuous EEG monitoring, or 15-30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> orally divided t.i.d.) and pyridoxal 5&rsquo;-phosphate (PLP, the active form of pyridoxine [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin B6</a>]) should be given to neonates with seizures unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants, particularly if the cause of the seizures is not known.</p><p>Trials should be performed with electroencephalographic and close cardiopulmonary monitoring, as there is a risk of apnea with pyridoxine, particularly when given IV. If there is no response to pyridoxine or PLP, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">leucovorin</a> (2.5 mg IV) may be administered, since some cases of antiquitin deficiency respond better to leucovorin (folinic acid) than pyridoxine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The results of one case series caution that EEG-response alone to pyridoxine IV does not definitively identify (nor does lack of initial response exclude) PDE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Individuals with pyridoxine- or leucovorin-responsive seizures should undergo further biochemical evaluation including measurement of urine alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (alpha-AASA) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plasma pipecolic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Some commercially available lysine-free formulas are also free of tryptophan, in which case tryptophan should be supplemented. Long-term treatment with high doses of pyridoxine can result in peripheral neuropathy.

Initiating therapy, selecting appropriate agents, and stopping or continuing therapy are the main decisions involved. There are no evidence-based or broadly-accepted guidelines for medical management of neonatal seizures, and the approach below is based on clinical experience, observational studies, and a limited number of randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Decision to institute drug therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After initial management of airway and cardiovascular support and the identification and institution of etiologic-specific therapy, the next decision is whether to initiate antiseizure drug therapy. Factors that must be considered include seizure duration and severity as well as seizure etiology. For example, neonates with brief seizures due to transient, reversible electrolyte or glucose abnormalities do not require immediate treatment with antiseizure drugs, while seizures due to other etiologies, particularly if they are prolonged, are properly treated with antiseizure drugs.</p><p>A common approach has been to treat clinically-evident seizures, with or without EEG confirmation of the diagnosis. The approach is problematic because it does not accurately or adequately treat true seizures; infants whose clinical events have no EEG correlate (ie, are not truly seizures) will be exposed unnecessarily to potentially harmful medication, while neonates with clinically-subtle or truly subclinical seizures will be insufficiently treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. EEG is therefore critical in the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal seizures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures#H15837841\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of neonatal seizures&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An approach to first-line and second-line antiseizure drug selection and dosing based on seizure frequency and individual patient characteristics is summarized in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F100337\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100337 \">algorithm 2</a>). The traditional strategy is to acutely treat seizures with a medication that can be subsequently given as maintenance therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84506691\"><span class=\"h3\">First-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Phenobarbital</a> has long been used as first-line therapy for seizures in neonates, and international survey data indicate that it remains the most commonly used agent in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. The next most frequently used first-line agent is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fosphenytoin</a>. Enteral absorption of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a> is limited for newborns, however, and maintenance dosing of phenytoin is very challenging. Neither agent appears to be more effective than the other and neither is completely effective.</p><p>This was demonstrated in the only randomized trial of first-line therapy in neonates with seizures, in which 59 infants with EEG-confirmed seizures were randomized to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Seizures were controlled by first-line therapy in less than half of the infants (43 versus 45 percent), and seizure severity was a better predictor of treatment success than the assigned treatment.</p><p>The initial dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a> is 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, followed by a maintenance dose of 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in two divided doses. If seizures do not resolve after the first loading dose, repeat boluses of 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> should be given with a goal phenobarbital level of approximately 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/mL</span> or a total 24-hour dose of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F100337\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100337 \">algorithm 2</a>). The use of both phenobarbital and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a> in the neonate requires additional knowledge concerning their pharmacologic characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Phenobarbital'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Phenytoin'</a> below.)</p><p>Acute treatment can also be initiated with a short-acting benzodiazepine, particularly if a delay is likely prior to availability and administration of a longer-acting medication. Other antiseizure drugs that can be given intravenously, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levetiracetam</a>, are being increasingly used for treatment of neonatal seizures but are not yet considered evidence-based first-line agents. (See <a href=\"#H84506704\" class=\"local\">'Refractory seizures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84506697\"><span class=\"h3\">Endpoint of acute therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to initiate acute therapy should come with a predefined, expected end point of treatment. Experts advocate the treatment of both clinical and subclinical electrographic seizures, since the only difference between the two types may be their cortical distribution.</p><p>It should be noted that neonates with electroclinical seizures may have electroclinical dissociation, or uncoupling, after treatment initiation. In this scenario, the clinical signs vanish but the electrographic seizures persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Ideal management therefore includes EEG confirmation of treatment response, which is defined most precisely by resolution of electrographic seizures.</p><p>The role of continuous EEG monitoring in directing treatment is highlighted in a guideline from the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Since most abnormal movements are not neonatal seizures and most neonatal seizures are subclinical, using EEG to guide treatment of neonatal seizures limits unnecessary exposure to antiseizure drugs for those whose events are not seizures and avoids undertreatment of those with subtle or subclinical seizures. However, it is acknowledged that no clinical data prove definitively that this approach improves long-term outcomes.</p><p>Current practice consists of acute antiseizure drug therapy until seizures are controlled, with the first medication given in sufficient doses to achieve seizure-freedom <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serum levels in the high therapeutic range <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the maximum tolerated dose. This is followed by additional medications, titrated to effect. (See <a href=\"#H84506704\" class=\"local\">'Refractory seizures'</a> below.)</p><p>In some cases, seizures cannot be completely controlled with standard treatment and the risks of adverse effects must be weighed against the potential benefit of complete seizure control. The etiology of the seizures is a major factor in this level of decision-making (eg, a target of complete seizure control may be appropriate for a neonate with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, but might be unreasonable for a newborn with lissencephaly).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84506704\"><span class=\"h3\">Refractory seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal seizures refractory to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a> often respond poorly to second-line antiseizure drugs. This observation is illustrated by results of a small trial that randomly assigned neonates whose seizures failed to respond to phenobarbital (11 of 22) to second line therapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonazepam</a> (n = 3), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a> (n = 3), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> (n=5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. No response was seen in the neonates treated with clonazepam or midazolam. Three of five responded to lidocaine; two neonates became seizure-free with 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per hour of lidocaine, and one had an 80 percent reduction in seizure burden. All of the 11 neonates whose seizures failed to respond to phenobarbital had a poor neurodevelopmental outcome at one year.</p><p>Choice of a second-line drug in infants who continue to seize despite first-line therapy must be individualized, as efficacy data are derived primarily from case series and not from randomized trials. The most commonly used drugs in this setting are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fosphenytoin</a>,</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levetiracetam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a>. Factors to consider when selecting an agent include seizure severity, the side effect profile of the drug, respiratory and cardiovascular stability of the patient, and the presence of cardiac, renal, or hepatic dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F100337\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100337 \">algorithm 2</a>). Suggested dosing is provided in the algorithm and discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H84506711\" class=\"local\">'Dosing considerations in neonates'</a> below.)</p><p>Newer anticonvulsants are increasingly prescribed for neonatal seizures, despite the fact that this is an off-label indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. This trend has been driven by incomplete efficacy of more standard agents and concerns about their potential neurotoxicity. However, there is little supporting evidence, and none from randomized controlled trials, that support a greater efficacy and lower adverse event rate with these agents in neonates. The published literature is limited by the lack of standardized medication dosing, variable timing of administration of the newer anticonvulsants, limited EEG monitoring to confirm diagnosis and treatment response, and absence of a placebo arm.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Levetiracetam</a> in particular has been used with increasing frequency, likely due to its readily available intravenous formulation and favorable side effect profile among older children and adults. It can be a good option in neonates with cardiac or liver dysfunction. Additionally, levetiracetam does not appear to enhance neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>] and might have neuroprotective effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Despite these encouraging observations, the pharmacokinetic and safety profile, and even the efficacy of levetiracetam for neonatal seizure treatment are not fully understood and may differ from older children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1320670828\" class=\"local\">'Levetiractetam'</a> below.)</p><p>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> is an effective agent for neonatal seizures in selected patients, with reported response rates ranging from 60 to 90 percent in mostly small, single-center studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/26,36-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,36-41</a>]. In cases of continued, EEG-confirmed status epilepticus despite high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a>, lidocaine may be the preferred second-line drug, provided there are no contraindications to its use (eg, congenital heart disease, pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fosphenytoin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a>)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F100337\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100337 \">algorithm 2</a>). In a retrospective study of over 400 full-term (n=319) and preterm (n=94) infants with neonatal seizures diagnosed by amplitude-integrated EEG who received lidocaine as a second or third-line agent, the overall response rate was 71 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Response rates were higher in full term than preterm infants (76 versus 55 percent).

Neonates with SE were given a repeat bolus of midazolam 0.10 to 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> if SE persisted 15 to 30 minutes after the initial bolus. While these results appear promising, randomized clinical trial data are needed to confirm that midazolam is effective for neonatal seizures, especially since midazolam was ineffective in a small randomized clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Pyridoxine and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) trials should also be considered in neonates with seizures that are refractory to conventional antiseizure drugs, particularly if the cause of the seizures is not known (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97078\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97078 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Although therapeutic hypothermia treatment may reduce clearance of phenobarbital marginally, no a priori change in loading or initial maintenance dosing is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The half-life of phenobarbital is greater in premature compared with term infants, and longer in the first month of life compared with older ages in term infants.</p><p>Thus, standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a> dosing in premature infants has the potential for higher serum levels and resultant toxicity. As the infant becomes older, identical daily maintenance doses may result in lower serum levels and create the potential for breakthrough seizures with no other change in the infant's clinical condition. Overall, monitoring trends of serum levels rather than day-to-day fluctuations are more useful in management of phenobarbital therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>].</p><p>A growing body of research on neuronal chloride homeostasis explains, at least in part, why <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a> is often incompletely effective in newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neonatal-seizures/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. The neuronal chloride gradient in mature neurons is maintained by KCC2 co-transporters, which decrease resting intracellular chloride concentrations. When gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are activated (eg, by medications such as phenobarbital), the cell is hyperpolarized. In immature neurons, KCC2 is underexpressed and NKCC1 co-transporters are prevalent. The result is a reversed neuronal chloride gradient, such that activation of GABA receptors can paradoxically depolarize the neuron.</p><p>These observations have led to interest in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">bumetanide</a> as a potential adjuvant treatment for neonatal seizures.

In addition, a redistribution of phenytoin results in a drop in brain concentrations after the first dose. Finally, phenytoin has poor oral bioavailability in infants.
