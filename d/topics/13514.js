Amphotericin B exerts its antifungal effect by disruption of fungal cell wall synthesis because of its ability to bind to sterols, primarily ergosterol, which leads to the formation of pores that allow leakage of cellular components. This affinity may also account for its toxic effects against select mammalian cells. Amphotericin B is generally considered cidal against susceptible fungi at clinically relevant concentrations.</p><p>Despite the introduction of newer antifungal agents for the treatment of systemic mycoses, amphotericin B remains the standard treatment for many severe, invasive fungal infections. However, because of toxicities associated with its intravenous use, along with the expanded availability of safer treatment options, it is frequently reserved for patients who have severe, life-threatening invasive fungal infections or who are unable to tolerate alternative antifungal agents.</p><p>The pharmacology of amphotericin B will be reviewed here. The nephrotoxicity and the clinical uses of amphotericin B are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Activity has also been demonstrated against <em>Leishmania</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Organisms that are usually resistant to amphotericin B include the organisms that cause chromoblastomycosis, <em>Aspergillus terreus</em>, <em>Candida lusitaniae</em>, <em>Scedosporium </em>spp, and some <em>Fusarium </em>spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p>Reports have raised concern regarding the emergence of <em>Candida auris</em>, a multidrug-resistant strain of <em>Candida</em> spp. <em>C. auris</em> susceptibility patterns are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults#H2357380752\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults&quot;, section on 'C. auris'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H248502\"><span class=\"h1\">AMPHOTERICIN B DEOXYCHOLATE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite over 40 years of clinical use, relatively little is known about the pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B differ from those of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> and from each other. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Lipid-based amphotericin B formulations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Absorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The drug is poorly absorbed (less than 5 percent) after oral administration. As a result, treatment of invasive mycoses requires intravenous administration. An oral suspension (no longer commercially available in the United States) is useful only in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis and is generally reserved for those infections that are refractory to other agents. Systemic absorption following aerosol administration is also thought to be minimal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum concentrations following intravenous infusions of 30 to 50 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> have ranged from 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. The drug is highly protein bound (up to 95 percent), primarily to lipoproteins. It is extensively distributed throughout the body, with a volume of distribution of approximately 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg</span>.</p><p>Amphotericin B concentrations can be measured in various body tissues and fluids, including liver, spleen, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, joint, vitreous body, and aqueous humor. Poor penetration into inflamed and uninflamed meninges has been reported, despite demonstrated clinical efficacy in central nervous system (CNS) fungal infections, such as cryptococcal meningitis and other fungal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolism/elimination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No metabolites have been identified. Drug elimination is biphasic, with a terminal half-life of up to 15 days. The primary route of elimination of amphotericin B is not known; urine and biliary excretion account for less than 5 percent of the administered dose. Serum levels are not influenced by hepatic or renal function or by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doses of intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> range from 0.1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. Doses of 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of amphotericin B deoxycholate have been investigated as prophylaxis in high-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, this practice has largely been replaced by alternative agents with less toxicity. The usual dose for most invasive mycoses is 0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. Doses exceeding 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day are generally reserved for treatment of mucormycosis and azole-refractory invasive coccidioidomycosis (such as meningitis). Daily doses of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day should not be exceeded. Pathogen- and disease-specific dosing recommendations have been published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for many invasive mycoses. The IDSA clinical practice guidelines can be accessed at the <a href=\"http://www.idsociety.org/idsa_practice_guidelines/&amp;token=AbH+hNktKLX8VTnqmXK1LVjvr2nHIsA+N7dT1tuHNd3JaYVlk/rGUYTAuQAsH99qtOLAaKOUU795tZaGcFVg9w==&amp;TOPIC_ID=476\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">IDSA's website</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The recommended dosing of amphotericin B for each fungal disease and infection site is discussed in detail separately. (See relevant topic reviews.)</p><p>The dose of amphotericin B does not need to be adjusted for renal dysfunction. In the setting of renal dysfunction, alternate-day therapy of twice the daily dose has been described. However, with the advent of lipid-based formulations, such a dosing strategy is rarely employed in current practice.</p><p>The dosing of lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Dosing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Method of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amphotericin B is most commonly administered intravenously, but direct or local instillation of amphotericin B has been used in several clinical circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H439193761\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravenous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous infusions are prepared by combining amphotericin B with 5 percent dextrose in water (D5W) at a final concentration of 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span>. Although the incidence of acute hypersensitivity reactions from amphotericin B is rare, a test dose of 1 mg has been recommended. The test dose can be given as an aliquot of the initial infusion, followed by the remainder of the dose if there is no apparent reaction within 30 minutes. However, tolerance of the test dose does not exclude other amphotericin B toxicities.</p><p>Infusion times are traditionally four to six hours. Amphotericin B has been given over shorter time periods (eg, 45 to 60 minutes), but infusion-related reactions (such as fever) may be more frequent, and this method is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The practice of titrating the daily dose to the target dose over several days has not been proven to lessen adverse reactions and may delay optimal therapy.</p><p>Intravenous administration of the total daily dose of amphotericin B given as a continuous infusion over 24 hours has been associated with less nephrotoxicity compared with administration over four hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, the efficacy of this administration schedule for patients with established infections has not been proven. Furthermore, amphotericin B exhibits concentration-dependent pharmacodynamics that may be compromised by continuous infusion. Continuous infusion of amphotericin B is not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and is not recommended.</p><p>Administration of premedications to patients receiving amphotericin B should be considered to prevent infusion-related reactions and nephrotoxicity. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H439193603\"><span class=\"h3\">Bladder irrigation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irrigation of the bladder with amphotericin B has been used in the treatment of candiduria. There have been several non-blinded randomized trials comparing amphotericin B bladder irrigation with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Although the use of amphotericin B bladder irrigation resulted in clearing of candiduria in many patients, relapses were routinely observed after several weeks. Traditionally, 50 mg of amphotericin B has been added to 1000 mL sterile water for irrigation and given as a continuous bladder irrigation daily for a period of five days. However, this regimen requires the presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, which itself is a risk factor for candiduria. Shorter treatment courses (one day) or reduced doses (as low as 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> have been recommended by some authors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p>Current published guidelines on the treatment of candiduria do not recommend the routine use of amphotericin B bladder irrigation, except in exceptional circumstances, such as treatment of adult nonneutropenic patients with symptomatic cystitis due to fluconazole-resistant species (<em>C. glabrata</em>, <em>C. krusei</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

This practice is discouraged because it causes abdominal pain and can contribute to adhesion formation and loss of the peritoneum as a dialyzing membrane. Patients with fungal peritonitis should be treated with catheter removal and systemic antifungal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Target doses generally range from 0.1 to 1.5 mg at intervals ranging from daily to weekly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]; lower doses (ie, 0.01 mg) can be started and increased slowly until target doses are reached or the patient shows signs of intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Adverse effects resulting from intrathecal administration are frequent and include, but are not limited to, nausea and vomiting, headache, back <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leg pain, loss of bowel <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bladder control, and nerve palsies. The development of arachnoiditis is a serious complication of this form of therapy.</p><p>Intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> can also be given through a ventricular Ommaya or Rickham reservoir. The target dose range is the same as for intrathecal administration in the lumbar subarachnoid space (0.1 to 1.5 mg daily to weekly). Severe vomiting, headache, and prostration can occur, and bacterial infection of the reservoir has been reported.</p><p>Cisternal administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a>, either through a reservoir or by direct injection, is used in some cases of coccidioidal meningitis in order to attain drug levels in the basilar meninges, where the infection is localized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The dose range is the same as for intrathecal and intraventricular administration noted above.

Severe renal failure due to amphotericin B deoxycholate alone is less common, but the risks of such reactions increase with diuretic-induced volume depletion or the concurrent administration of another nephrotoxin (such as an aminoglycoside, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, nephrotoxic cancer chemotherapy, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a>). Amphotericin B deoxycholate is substantially more nephrotoxic than the lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B. This is discussed in greater detail separately.
