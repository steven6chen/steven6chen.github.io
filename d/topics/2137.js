The incidence of blunt cerebrovascular injury in patients sustaining blunt trauma is about 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Untreated blunt carotid injury is associated with mortality rates that range from 23 to 28 percent, with 48 to 58 percent of survivors suffering permanent severe neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>Given the potential for high morbidity and mortality rates associated with untreated blunt cerebrovascular injury, expectant management is not appropriate unless there are contraindications to treatment. Treatment strategies include antithrombotic therapy, surgical repair, and endovascular intervention. The treatment strategy for a given individual depends upon <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> symptoms, site of injury, severity or grade of injury, associated injuries that may complicate treatment, and local expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The treatment and outcomes of blunt cerebrovascular injury are reviewed. The injury mechanisms, screening, and diagnosis of blunt cerebrovascular injury are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt cerebrovascular injury: Mechanisms, screening, and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Penetrating cerebrovascular injury and spontaneous cerebrovascular dissection are discussed elsewhere.

For the carotid artery, stroke rates increase with increasing injury grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Stroke incidence and neurologic outcome for vertebral injury are independent of injury grade. In a study of 171 patients found to have 236 blunt cerebrovascular injuries, the distribution of injury is representative: grade I (58 percent), grade II (22 percent), grade III (14 percent), grade IV (11 percent), and grade V (3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The injury grades given below apply to carotid or vertebral artery lesions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I: Intimal irregularity or dissection with &lt;25 percent luminal narrowing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II: Dissection or intramural hematomas with &ge;25 percent luminal narrowing, intraluminal clot, or a visible intimal flap. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III: Pseudoaneurysm or hemodynamically insignificant arteriovenous fistula. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade IV: Complete occlusion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade V: Transection with active extravasation (hemorrhage) or hemodynamically significant arteriovenous fistula. These injuries are often lethal. Transection injuries mandate immediate attempts to control bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H785734511\" class=\"local\">'Other interventions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259192\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the incidence of blunt cerebrovascular injury is very low and experience with this problem is limited, even in busy trauma centers, no controlled trials are available to help guide management. Treatment is based upon the demonstration of reduced neurologic and other morbidity and mortality in treated patients compared with those who are untreated (and to historical controls), from indirect evidence derived from the penetrating neck injury literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and from strategies used in the management of non-traumatic cerebrovascular disorders (eg, spontaneous cerebrovascular dissection). Our treatment recommendations are in general agreement with protocols established by major trauma societies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78174\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78174 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The mainstay of treatment for surgically inaccessible injuries (&gt;99 percent) is antithrombotic therapy (heparin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, or antiplatelet therapy), but the optimal regimen is not known with respect to agent, duration of treatment, or endpoint of therapy. Associated injuries often limit antithrombotic therapy. Endovascular intervention is another option, but stents also require antithrombotic therapy. Factors that determine the treatment strategy for a specific individual include symptoms, site of injury, severity or grade of injury, and associated injuries that may contraindicate a specific therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The rationale and recommendations for antithrombotic therapy or other intervention, follow-up, and injury grade-specific recommendations are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H785733443\" class=\"local\">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H785734511\" class=\"local\">'Other interventions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H259255\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up for healing or progression'</a> below and <a href=\"#H785740622\" class=\"local\">'Injury grade-specific recommendations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785733443\"><span class=\"h2\">Antithrombotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend antithrombotic therapy (heparin or antiplatelet therapy) for all patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury who do not have contraindications (eg, active hemorrhage [grade V]) from the vessel. (See <a href=\"#H785740391\" class=\"local\">'Associated injuries that may contradict antithrombotic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The rationale for using antithrombotic therapy for blunt cerebrovascular injury is based upon reduced rates of neurologic morbidity and mortality identified in retrospective reviews of anticoagulated patients or those treated with antiplatelet agents compared with untreated patients with treatment contraindications or historic, untreated controls, for whom stroke rates are typically 50 percent or greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/1-4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,9,10</a>]. Stroke rates in case series from the era prior to screening were considerably higher than contemporary series, as injuries were not diagnosed until the ischemic neurologic event. In studies that reflect the use of antithrombotic therapies, overall stroke rates for blunt injury (all grades) of the internal carotid artery, common carotid artery, and vertebral injuries are 26 to 41 percent, 11 percent, and 14 to 24 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/1,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12</a>]. Stroke rates increase with increasing injury grade for carotid but not vertebral artery injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. In one study, stroke rates for 114 blunt carotid and 79 blunt vertebral injuries were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I: Carotid 8 percent; vertebral 6 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II: Carotid 14 percent; vertebral 38 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III: Carotid 26 percent; vertebral 27 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade IV: Carotid 50 percent; vertebral 28 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade V: Carotid 100 percent</p><p/><p>Multiple retrospective studies have found improved neurologic outcomes among symptomatic patients and fewer ischemic neurologic events (stroke) in asymptomatic patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury who are heparinized compared with those who are not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/1,2,4,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,12-15</a>]. Injury-specific mortality rates are also reduced. However, patients who are not treated are usually more severely injured, with contraindications to treatment, such as head injury, which influences the comparison. The largest of these studies are summarized below. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large retrospective review, arteriography was used to screen 727 of 15,767 blunt-trauma patients at high risk for blunt cerebrovascular injury, which was identified in 244 of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Antithrombotic therapy was initiated in 187 asymptomatic patients with heparin (n = 117), low-molecular-weight heparin (n = 11), and antiplatelet agents (n = 59). Asymptomatic patients who were treated with antithrombotic therapy had a lower ischemic neurologic event rate compared with 48 patients who were not able to be anticoagulated (0.5 versus 21 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective trauma registry review identified 139 blunt cerebrovascular injuries in 96 patients, 75 involving the carotid arteries (14 bilateral), 64 involving the vertebral arteries (14 bilateral), and 15 patients with both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Antithrombotic therapy (heparin, antiplatelet therapy) was used to treat 43 of 75 carotid injuries and 39 of 50 vertebral artery injuries. Stroke rates for treated and untreated patients were 6.8 versus 64 percent for carotid artery injury, and 2.6 versus 54 percent for vertebral artery injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunt carotid artery injury was identified in 114 patients screened out of 643 patients at risk from 13,280 blunt trauma admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. None of 73 patients treated with antithrombotic therapy suffered a stroke, whereas 46 percent of the 41 patients who did not receive anticoagulation developed ischemic neurologic events. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785733542\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In agreement with major society trauma guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78174\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78174 \">algorithm 1</a>), we suggest initiating antithrombotic therapy in patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].<strong> </strong>We administer heparin as a weight-based infusion of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour (no bolus), to achieve an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 40 to 50 seconds (lower target range compared with other indications). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a>.) </p><p>We prefer heparin in the acute setting because it is reversible (many of these patients will require surgery for unrelated injuries) and may be more effective than antiplatelet drugs. There are no randomized trials directly comparing heparin with antiplatelet therapy in the management of blunt cerebrovascular injury; however, a few small retrospective case series and reports from two large trauma centers suggest that antiplatelet therapy may be at least as effective as systemic heparinization for stroke prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/1,9,10,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10,16-18</a>]. Key results are summarized below. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 114 patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury found no significant differences in healing or in progression of injury grade whether the patients were treated with heparin (n = 45) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (n = 24) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among the 45 patients who had ischemic neurologic symptoms attributable to the injury, treatment with heparin (n = 31) improved the patient's neurologic status in a greater percentage of patients (71 versus 60 percent) compared with patients treated with aspirin (n = 5), but the difference was not significant. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 301 patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury (some overlap with the study above), heparin (n = 192), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (n = 67), or aspirin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> (n = 23) were used to treat 192 asymptomatic patients; 107 patients were untreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There were no significant differences in injury healing (39, 43, 46 percent) or progression of injury grade (12, 10, 15 percent) between the treatment groups. A single stroke (0.5 percent) occurred among patients who were treated (heparin group) compared with a stroke rate of 21 percent in the untreated group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study identified 22 patients with blunt carotid injury over an eight year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Of these, eight patients received no treatment, seven patients were treated with heparin, and seven with antiplatelet therapy. No differences in neurologic outcomes were observed between anticoagulated patients and those receiving antiplatelet therapy. Bleeding complications were higher in patients treated with heparin compared with antiplatelet therapy with four of the anticoagulated patients suffering major bleeding complications that required cessation of heparin and blood transfusion.</p><p/><p>For patients who have contraindications to anticoagulation with heparin, we use antiplatelet agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 325 mg daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> 75 mg daily). (See <a href=\"#H785740391\" class=\"local\">'Associated injuries that may contradict antithrombotic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The treatment of patients who suffer stroke after blunt cerebrovascular injury has not been well studied. One group reported significant improvement in neurologic outcomes following heparin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A later trial found that antiplatelet therapy was not inferior to anticoagulation (heparin followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) for preventing recurrent stroke after carotid dissection (3 versus 1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The small advantage offered by antithrombotic therapy was counterbalanced by one major subarachnoid bleed in the anticoagulation group. It should be noted that all of the enrolled patients had suffered a stroke or transient ischemic attack, and that these were not trauma patients, so whether these results can be generalized to patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury is unclear.</p><p>Although dual antiplatelet therapy may be indicated for other conditions, we do not use dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury due to an increased risk of bleeding and undemonstrated benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>For long-term anticoagulation, a transition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> has been used in the past, but antiplatelet therapy may be preferable to warfarin in the long term due to its potential equivalent efficacy (as discussed above), better safety profile, and lower cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

One study noted that bleeding requiring either transfusion or cessation of heparin occurred in 54 percent of patients treated with heparin when administering a bolus dose or titrating to a standard activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) goal of 60 to 80 seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A more conservative protocol for initiation (no bolus) and maintenance of heparin infusion (aPTT 40-50) should be used in any injured patient at risk for bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].

No patient required cessation of antithrombotic therapy, which consisted of heparin infusion in 71 percent and antiplatelet therapy in 29 percent.

However, many blunt cerebrovascular injuries involve the vessel (eg, internal carotid artery) at the base of the skull and are therefore <strong>not</strong> surgically accessible. In our experience, only 2 of 700 patients treated with blunt cerebrovascular injury had a surgically accessible lesion. This experience is shared by others. Thus, inaccessibility precludes direct surgical repair in most patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury. </p><p>Indirect evidence of benefit for this approach comes from observational studies of patients with penetrating cerebrovascular injury, which have found lower rates of neurologic morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing neck exploration and vascular repair compared with nonoperative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/6,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25,26</a>]. In retrospective studies that compared carotid artery repair to carotid artery ligation, patients with minimal neurologic deficits did much better with repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/11,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,27,28</a>].

The carotid artery occlusion rate was higher in patients who underwent stenting compared with patients who were treated with antithrombotic agents alone (21 versus 5 percent). </p><p>One retrospective review revealed a difference in stent usage. Endovascular intervention was performed in 9 percent of 237 patients with blunt cerebrovascular injuries identified from 2013 to 2016, whereas among 128 patients identified from 2011 to 2012, stents were used in 34 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Given that the stroke rate was no different, the authors concluded that anticoagulation alone is sufficient for the majority of blunt cerebrovascular injuries. It is clear that caution is needed, when endovascular therapy is chosen, to avoid dislodging debris during stent deployment, and post-stent antithrombotic therapy is mandatory.

Because a significant number of injuries evolve in a manner that alters therapy, we perform a follow-up study 7 to 10 days after the injury has been identified (inpatient or outpatient), or for any change in neurologic status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F96260\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96260 \">image 1</a>).

If complete healing has been demonstrated by follow-up imaging, antithrombotic therapy can be discontinued. </p><p>The dynamic nature of blunt cerebrovascular injury is illustrated in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 114 patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury, follow-up arteriography was performed within 10 days in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Grade I and grade II injuries frequently changed, with 57 percent of grade I and 8 percent of grade II injuries healing completely, allowing cessation of treatment. Progression to pseudoaneurysm formation was seen in 8 percent of grade I and 43 percent of grade II lesions, prompting interventional treatment. Higher-grade injuries changed very little, with 93 percent of grade III and 82 percent of grade IV injuries remaining unchanged. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of consecutive patients treated and followed over 10 years found 133 blunt cerebrovascular injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of the surviving patients, no patient experienced cerebral infarction after discharge. Angiographic follow-up was available for 50 patients representing 67 injuries at a mean of six months. Seventy-two percent of grade I injuries were healed at follow-up. Of the grade II lesions, 40 percent worsened while 30 percent improved. The majority of grade III lesions remained the same or enlarged, prompting treatment with endovascular stents. </p><p/><p>If the lesion remains, the patients should be maintained on antithrombotic therapy, but the optimal drug and duration of therapy have not been studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. For those who do continue antithrombotic therapy, we obtain a study at three months following the injury to determine whether antithrombotic therapy can be discontinued, and if another treatment (eg, stenting) is needed. In the absence of documented healing of the vessel, it is reasonable to provide ongoing treatment, since delayed stroke can occur and has been reported as long as 14 years after injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. We continue antiplatelet therapy (typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, 81 mg daily) indefinitely for patients who do <strong>not</strong> demonstrate documented healing (ie, persistent flap, dissection) of the vessel on follow-up imaging (digital subtraction arteriography or computed tomographic [CT] angiography). However, for some patients, the risk of the imaging examination may be greater than simply continuing antithrombotic therapy. </p><p>Studies identifying progression or healing of the vascular lesion have typically used conventional arteriography, but we prefer to use CT angiography (&ge;16 slice) because of its noninvasive nature. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography is an alternative (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F95681%7ERADIOL%2F96261%7ERADIOL%2F96262\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95681 graphicRef96261 graphicRef96262 \">image 2A-C</a>).

Initial treatment with either heparin or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate for grade I injuries, as there are no data demonstrating superiority of one over the other. We generally administer heparin in hospitalized patients who may be undergoing surgical procedures, because the effects can be quickly reversed. However, once the risk for bleeding is reduced, we transition to antiplatelet therapy given its low cost and simplicity of administration.

Neurologic outcomes are improved in symptomatic patients, and fewer ischemic neurologic events (stroke) occur in asymptomatic patients who are treated with antithrombotic therapy.
