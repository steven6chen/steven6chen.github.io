Spinal fluid is fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. In some people, too much spinal fluid can put pressure on the brain. Hydrocephalus is sometimes called &quot;water on the brain.&quot;</p><p>Babies who are born too early or born with a brain problem are more likely to get hydrocephalus. A head injury or other problem that affects the brain can also cause the problem in people at any age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111755013\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hydrocephalus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In babies, the main symptom is a head that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is bigger than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grows larger very fast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has an odd shape</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has an outward bulge at the soft spot on the top of the head</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has veins that bulge out</p><p/><p>In older babies and children, symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A head that is bigger than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches (often in the morning)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyes that stay looking down and cannot look up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick (nausea) and throwing up (vomiting)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not feeling hungry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sleepy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111755028\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hydrocephalus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. In newborns, doctors use an ultrasound, a test that uses sound waves to take pictures of the brain. The doctor or nurse also measures the baby's head to see how fast it is growing. In older children, doctors use other imaging tests such as an MRI or CT scan to take a picture of the brain.</p><p>The doctor might also do a &quot;lumbar puncture&quot; (sometimes called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;). During this procedure, he or she puts a thin needle into the child's lower back and removes a small amount of spinal fluid to check it for problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111755043\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hydrocephalus treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors treat hydrocephalus with surgery that creates a way for the extra spinal fluid to drain from the brain. There are 2 types of surgery that are most often performed to treat hydrocephalus:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shunt &ndash; A shunt is a device that goes in the fluid-filled space inside the brain. It is connected to a tube that is placed under the skin and that empties into the belly, heart, or chest. The shunt helps drain the extra spinal fluid from the brain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83273\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83273 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third ventriculostomy &ndash; This type of surgery creates a small opening in part of the brain to help drain extra spinal fluid.</p><p/><p>The type of surgery used depends on how old the child is and what caused the hydrocephalus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111755058\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my child's life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children who have surgery for hydrocephalus will need at least 1 more surgery to fix or change the shunt system. This is called a &quot;shunt revision.&quot; Many children need multiple surgeries over their lifetime. The reason for this is because as the child grows, the shunt tubing can stretch or move out of place. Over time, the shunt system can fail for other reasons.</p><p>Problems that can happen in children treated for hydrocephalus include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A problem with the shunt &ndash; Shunts sometimes get infected or stop working. If this happens, the child can get sick suddenly. The symptoms can include fever, headache, or vomiting. If these symptoms develop, the child should see a doctor right away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures &ndash; Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The child might have jerking movements, get stiff, stop responding and stare for a few seconds, or pass out. If a child starts having seizures, he or she should see a doctor right away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developmental delays &ndash; Some children with hydrocephalus have developmental delays and learning problems. They might not reach certain milestones (like learning how to sit, walk, and talk) at the age that most children do, or at all. If your child's doctor is concerned about this, he or she might refer you to an &quot;early intervention&quot; program to help. Some children with learning problems need a special learning plan for school.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111755073\"><span class=\"h1\">Can adults get hydrocephalus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Adults can get hydrocephalus after a head injury or other problem with the brain. In some cases, adults have the same symptoms as children.</p><p>Some older adults get a type called &quot;normal pressure hydrocephalus.&quot; The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with thinking and memory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leaking urine or other bladder control problems</p><p/><p>The tests and treatments for hydrocephalus in adults are the same as for children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61828516\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spina-bifida-myelomeningocele-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Spina bifida (myelomeningocele) (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
