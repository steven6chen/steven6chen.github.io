The sacrum is made up of five developmentally fused vertebral levels (S1 to S5), followed by a terminal bony prominence, the coccyx. The entire region is commonly described as the lumbosacral spine.</p><p>Directly beneath each lumbar and sacral vertebra, there is a pair of neural foramina with the same number designation, such that the L1 neural foramina are located just below the L1 vertebral body. Neural foramina are bounded superiorly and inferiorly by pedicles, anteriorly by the intervertebral disc and vertebral body, and posteriorly by facet joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66123\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66123 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Through each neural foramen passes the same numbered spinal nerve root, recurrent meningeal nerves, and radicular blood vessels. On each side there are five lumbar, five sacral, and one coccygeal spinal nerve roots.</p><p>All lumbar and sacral spinal nerve roots originate at the T10 to L1 vertebral level, where the spinal cord terminates at the conus medullaris. A dorsal (somatic sensory) root from the posterolateral aspect of the spinal cord and a ventral (somatic motor) root from the anterolateral aspect of the cord join in the spinal canal to form the spinal nerve root (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66123\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66123 \">figure 1</a>). The roots then course down through the intraspinal canal, forming the cauda equina, until they exit at their respective neural (intervertebral) foramina. Thus, the lumbosacral nerve roots exit the spinal canal at a lower level than where they arise. A potential consequence of this arrangement is that intraspinal pathology may affect roots at higher levels than the level where the roots exit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Cell bodies of the motor nerve fibers are located in the ventral (anterior) horns of the spinal cord, while those of the sensory nerve fibers are in a dorsal root ganglion at each lumbar and sacral level. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tend to be located within the neural foramina, and are therefore not strictly speaking intraspinal (ie, within the lumbar canal). However, at the low lumbar and sacral levels there is a tendency for DRG to reside proximal to the neural foramina, within the intraspinal canal, as found in 11 to 38 percent of cases at L5 and 71 percent at S1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The dorsal root ganglia are attached to the vertebral body on the transverse process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Compressive radicular disease typically occurs proximal to this.</p><p>As noted above, the spinal cord normally terminates at the conus medullaris within the lumbar intraspinal canal between the T10 and L1 vertebral levels. Exceptions include patients with congenital spinal deformities known as spina bifida, in which the fetal conus is tethered to ligamentous or bony structures, causing lengthening of the spinal cord during development. In such patients, the conus medullaris can be displaced downward to the middle or lower lumbar spine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Rami</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Just distal to the neural foramen, the nerve root divides in two, forming the dorsal and ventral primary rami.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The small dorsal (posterior) primary ramus supplies motor innervation to the paraspinal muscles and cutaneous innervation to the skin of the trunk and back</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The large ventral (anterior) primary ramus supplies motor and sensory innervation to the legs and trunk, including abdominal wall muscles</p><p/><p>The dorsal rami of the spinal nerves also supply the apophyseal joints and the paraspinal muscles. They innervate structures both above and below the level of the nerve. Clinical evaluation of injury to the dorsal rami is difficult because of the overlap in areas innervated by these nerves and because of the limited ability to clinically evaluate individual paraspinal muscles. However, electromyography can be helpful in determining the distribution of disease.</p><p>The ventral rami innervate the extremities and the trunk. These branches can be evaluated by assessing the motor and sensory functions of the different myotomes and dermatomes, respectively. However, variability to the dermatomal and myotomal distribution of innervation exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Myotomes and dermatomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The collection of muscles with significant innervation from a single root is called a myotome. Similarly, the sensory distribution of a single root is labeled a dermatome.</p><p>The primary manifestations of lumbosacral root disease can be broken up into dysfunction of two distinct systems: motor and sensory. Motor dysfunction from a root lesion may cause weakness in some or all muscles innervated by that root. However, many muscles have innervation from multiple roots, which may result in preserved strength despite significant involvement of a single root.</p><p>Although there are classic descriptions for the distributions of myotomes and dermatomes, substantial variability exists in these distributions from person to person [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Sensory fields have considerable overlap, but there are areas that are exclusively served by individual nerves. These areas are called autonomous zones. The most important of these in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathies include the sole of the foot (S1), dorsum of the foot (L5), medial calf (L4), and anterior thigh (L2 and 3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Lumbosacral myotomes are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64209\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64209 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Sinuvertebral nerves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sinuvertebral nerves are sensory nerves that innervate various structures within the spine, such as ligamentous structures, the dura, periosteum, and blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. They originate distal to the dorsal root ganglia and extend to communicate with branches from radicular levels both above and below the level of entry, as well as the contralateral side, making it difficult to localize pain from involvement of these nerves.</p><p>Irritation of the sinuvertebral nerves may result in low back pain. Because they arise distal to the nerve root, however, involvement of sinuvertebral nerves or their branches without involvement of the rest of the nerve root is not considered to be radicular in nature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common etiology of lumbosacral radiculopathy is nerve root compression caused by a disc herniation or spondylosis, which is, narrowing of the intraspinal (central) canal, the lateral recess, or the neural foramen due to degenerative arthritis affecting the spine. The lateral recess is the most lateral space in the lumbar canal&rsquo;s triangular configuration, just proximal to the intervertebral foramen. It is bounded laterally by the pedicle, posteriorly by the superior articular facet and ligamentum flavum, and anteriorly by the vertebral body, endplate edge, or disk edge.</p><p>Additional etiologies include nonskeletal causes of nerve root compression and noncompressive mechanisms such as infection, inflammation, neoplasm, and vascular disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain generators in the lumbosacral spine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of tissues making up the low back contain nerve fibers with pain receptors. These are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76627\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76627 \">table 2</a>). Of note, intervertebral disc material does not contain significant numbers of pain fibers.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic radiating pain from spinal nerve injury is mediated through proximal spinal nerves. Compression of a spinal nerve root by disc or arthritic spur leads to local edema, ischemia, and inflammation. These factors contribute to production of pain impulses through the spinal nerves. The pain from acute disc herniation or spondylotic spinal nerve entrapment reflects a combination of pain generation within the nerve root itself, as well as the pain from neighboring tissues whose pain fibers are activated by the effect of disc herniation on dura, ligaments, and surrounding vasculature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized lumbosacral pain is thought to arise from intraspinal structures. These pain impulses arise from the blood vessels, dura mater, and longitudinal ligaments, and travel in the sinuvertebral nerves through the neural foramina, connecting via rami communicantes with the extraspinal sympathetic chain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonlocalized, nonradiating pain is thought to arise from muscle, bone, and ligament outside the spinal canal. Interconnected ventral and dorsal nerve plexuses surround the vertebral column [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The ventral nerve plexus serves the anterior longitudinal ligament and has bilateral innervation. Many branches from the sympathetic trunk, rami communicantes, and perivascular nerve plexuses join to form the ventral nerve plexus. The dorsal nerve plexus arises from the sinuvertebral nerves and serves the posterior longitudinal ligament.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referred spine pain may arise from the abdominal viscera that share the same spinal level of innervation. Organs that can potentially refer pain to the spine include the aorta, pancreas, duodenum, colon, rectum, kidney, ureter, bladder, and pelvic organs. Systemic illness can refer pain to the bony spine or can produce bony disease that generates spine pain. The major categories and clues to their diagnosis are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69498\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69498 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Degenerative changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Damage to spinal nerve roots occurs as the result of degenerative change involving three main structures, which are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intervertebral discs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The uncovertebral joints (cervical spine only)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The zygapophyseal (facet) joints</p><p/><p>Resulting bony overgrowth (osteophytes) or disc herniation at these points may directly impinge on spinal nerve roots or the spinal cord, or their effect may be primarily to produce instability and misalignment of the spine (ie, degenerative spondylolisthesis) that in turn produces pain and neurologic deficits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74811 \">figure 2</a>). It is not known whether changes in these different structures are causally related or occur independently.</p><p>Degenerative spondylotic changes are common with aging and usually do not result in radiculopathy. Low back pain associated with degenerative changes is distinct from radicular pain and is much more frequent. Given the inability to ascertain the exact cause, it is commonly referred to as nonspecific low back pain.</p><p>One school of thought suggests that degenerative spondylotic change is led by age-related change in the nucleus pulposus of the disc. With age there is gradual narrowing of the disc space coincident with changes in disc proteoglycan composition. Later, cracks develop in the disc, and deposits of gas and calcification may form. Eventually the disc material becomes desiccated and friable.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A disc bulge involves &gt;90 degrees of the total circumference of a disc and does not extend beyond the boundaries of the annulus fibrosus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A disc herniation is a rupture of disc material beyond the annulus fibrosus. There a two broad categories, protrusion and extrusion. Protrusion refers to a rupture of disc material in which the base is broader than the dome. In general this does not extend above or below the disc space. An extrusion is a disc rupture in which the dome is wider than the base, with a dumbbell appearance. Extrusions may extend above or below the disc space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A free fragment is a displacement of disc material that loses its connection with the main disc material. Such fragments can migrate from the disc space.</p><p/><p>Age-related changes also occur in the annulus fibrosus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66123\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66123 \">figure 1</a>), which becomes more fibrotic and less elastic. Fissures develop and calcium is deposited. As the disc shrinks and the intervertebral disc space narrows, the annulus tends to buckle out. A tear or rupture of the annulus fibrosus is a degenerative loss of integrity of the annular ring surrounding the disc material involving single or multiple layers without disc displacement through the ring. These are not usually apparent on routine MRI studies.</p><p>Accompanying this disc degeneration are changes at the vertebral body endplates adjacent to the disc. The marrow undergoes fibrovascular change or fatty marrow replacement. Finally, endplate sclerosis develops. Osteophyte formation occurs at the margins of the vertebral bodies. What triggers osteophyte formation is unclear, although spinal movement at ligamentous attachment sites and loss of buffering tissues between bony surfaces likely play roles. Osteophyte production appears to slow as advancing spondylosis leads to decreasing spinal movement.</p><p>Facet joint degeneration may not be directly related to spondylotic changes, but often coexists. Disc degeneration is likely to put additional weight-bearing strains on facet joints, which are not weight-bearing structures. With unnatural movement of the spine, the synovial joint bears more structural burden, degenerates, and develops osteophytes. These osteophytes grow into the posterior aspect of the neural foramen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77488\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77488 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Disc protrusion and level of injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationship between disc disease and lumbosacral radiculopathy was first identified in 1934 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Disc protrusion can give rise to different anatomic levels of nerve root compression depending on the orientation of spinal nerve roots as they exit from the spinal cord. As noted earlier, all lumbar and sacral spinal nerve roots are constituted at the T12-L1 vertebral level, where the spinal cord ends as the conus medullaris. The roots then course down the canal as the cauda equina, until they exit at their respective neural foramina.</p><p>Depending upon the nature and location of intraspinal compression, roots may be injured at any disc level, from the L1-2 level to the level of their exit into their neural foramina. For example, the L5 root can be compressed by a central disc protrusion at the L2-3 or L3-4 level, a lateral disc protrusion at the L4-5 level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81881\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81881 \">image 2</a>), or disc protrusion into the foramen at the L5-S1 level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F79837\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79837 \">image 3</a>). Because of the presence of multiple spinal nerve roots in the cauda equina, there is increased likelihood of multiple, bilateral simultaneous nerve root compressions.</p><p>Nerve root injury may be complete or only partial and thus may involve all or only a subset of root fibers. With partial injury, incomplete myotomal involvement may result, making the distinction between a radiculopathy and a peripheral nerve injury more challenging.</p><p>The lumbosacral spine is susceptible to disc herniations because of its mobility from flexion, extension, and torsion. Seventy-five percent of flexion and extension occurs at the lumbosacral joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This level, on the other hand, has limited torsion. Twenty percent of flexion and extension occurs at L4-L5. The remaining 5 percent occurs between L1 and L3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels are most susceptible to injuries from routine movements of the spine, about 90 to 95 percent of compressive radiculopathies occur at these levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The incidence of radiculopathies is split somewhat evenly between L4-L5 and L5-S1, as the lack of torsion at L5-S1 helps to increase its stability despite its higher degree of flexion and extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Next in frequency is L4. Other levels are uncommon.</p><p>Far lateral herniations are seen more often at the L2-4 levels. They may affect the rostral root. This is rare, as only 10 percent of far lateral herniations will result in nerve root compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Pain from the far lateral disc herniations may be more severe due to compression of the dorsal root ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Other skeletal causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital abnormalities of the bony spinal column or its contents occur in 25 to 50 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Congenital narrowing of the canal is not uncommon as a substrate upon which spondylosis may result in neurologic disease; this is especially true of younger adults. Other developmental abnormalities include tethered cord or diastematomyelia and spina bifida. They may lead to radicular dysfunction due to injuries resulting from traction of the root.</p><p>Root avulsion is a rare cause of lumbosacral radiculopathy that may occur with fractures of the sacroiliac joint or with diastasis of the symphysis pubis or the pubic rami [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonskeletal causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection, inflammation, neoplasm, and vascular disease are less common causes of radiculopathy and polyradiculopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57491\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57491 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].

Polymerase chain reaction may be positive for cytomegalovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Herpes zoster colonizes the dorsal root ganglion and may remain latent for years. Reactivation is associated with a hemorrhagic lymphocytic infiltration of the ventral roots. Patients present with an erythematous vesicular maculopapular rash in the dermatome of the affected root that lasts for three to five days. Sensory changes characterized by marked allodynia often follow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. When the motor nerve root is involved (so called segmental zoster) a clinical picture of radiculopathy with weakness occurs in affected myotomes.</p><p>Root infarction may occur from either large vessel or small vessel disease. It is most commonly seen in diabetics where the microvasculature is affected. Such a process may be one of the causes of the clinical syndrome known as diabetic amyotrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Diabetic amyotrophy involves the L2, L3, and L4 roots and presents with weakness, pain, and dysesthesia primarily in the proximal leg that evolves over days to weeks. This condition is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-amyotrophy-and-idiopathic-lumbosacral-radiculoplexus-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic amyotrophy and idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiculopathy may also arise in the absence of obvious compression, leading to the hypothesis that the injury may be due to a chemical radiculitis, perhaps caused by the rupture of the annulus fibrosus with subsequent release of inflammatory mediators tracking along the nerve root sheath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Electromyography may be abnormal even though compression is not observed on imaging studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9619462\"><span class=\"h2\">Fiber size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like most peripheral nerves, lumbosacral nerve roots are composed of both large and small fibers. Different fiber types play different roles by virtue of the information they carry. Injury to these fibers may result in focal demyelination as seen initially with compression, or axonal damage as seen with infarction or more severe compressive injury.</p><p>Large fibers carry motor efferent and sensory information involved with vibratory sense and conscious and unconscious proprioception. The typical clinical findings of large fiber involvement in radiculopathies are weakness and reflex abnormalities. Deep tendon reflexes may be diminished or lost. Clinical testing for proprioception and vibratory sense tends to extend across different dermatomes and thus is often not as helpful in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathies as small fiber modalities, as discussed below.</p><p>The smaller myelinated A-delta fibers and unmyelinated C fibers carry pain and temperature information. A-delta fibers transmit cold sensation, while C fibers subserve warm sensation. Isolated injury to these fibers is not common in lumbosacral radiculopathies. However, their dermatomal distributions tend to be more specific than those of the large fibers, increasing their importance in the clinical evaluation of radiculopathies.</p><p>In addition, dysfunction of A-delta and C fibers even in the absence of overt nerve root compression may play a significant role in the symptomatology of radiculopathies. A study of warm and cold sensory thresholds in 32 patients with unilateral L5 or S1 radiculopathy and disc herniation found that warm thresholds (C fiber function) were impaired to a greater extent than cold thresholds (A-delta fibers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Since it is thought that unmyelinated axons, such as C fibers, are less affected by compression than myelinated ones, this finding suggests that the generation of lumbar radicular pain is mediated by inflammation more than by nerve root compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Central pain sensitization may result from nerve root compression. Supporting evidence comes from a small study of patients with L5 or S1 radiculopathy that demonstrated a lowered pain threshold in the contralateral root, perhaps mediated by pre- and postsynaptic modulation of opioidergic interneurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumbosacral radiculopathy is one of the most common problems seen in neurologic consultation. Although data are limited, the estimated lifetime prevalence is approximately 3 to 5 percent for adults, with equal rates among men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentations of lumbosacral radiculopathy vary according the level of nerve root or roots involved. The most frequent are the L5 and S1 radiculopathies. All lumbosacral nerve roots exit the spinal canal at the neural foramina below their respective vertebrae. As an example, the L5 nerve roots exit via the neural foramina at the <span class=\"nowrap\">L5/S1</span> disc space level. Thus, posterolateral disc herniation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">L4/L5</span> disc usually compresses the L5 nerve root, while posterolateral disc herniation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">L5/S1</span> disc typically compresses the S1 nerve root.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">L1 radiculopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumbar disc herniation at the L1 level is rare, and thus L1 radiculopathy is uncommon. Symptoms on presentation generally involve pain, paresthesia, and sensory loss in the inguinal region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Rarely, minor hip flexion weakness is present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">L2/L3/L4 radiculopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is marked overlap of the L2, L3, and L4 innervation of the anterior thigh muscles, making it difficult to differentiate these spinal nerve root levels based on symptoms, neurologic examination, or electrodiagnostic testing. Thus, these radiculopathies are generally considered as a group. These nerve roots are most commonly involved in older patients with symptoms of spinal stenosis.</p><p>Acute back pain is the most common presenting complaint, often radiating around the anterior aspect of the thigh down into the knee and occasionally down the medial aspect of the lower leg as far as the arch of the foot. On examination, there may be weakness of hip flexion, knee extension, and hip adduction. Higher lesions may result in greater weakness of the hip flexors. Sensation may be reduced over the anterior thigh down to the medial aspect of the lower leg. A reduced knee reflex is common in the presence of moderate weakness.</p><p>Electromyography and nerve conduction studies may reveal abnormalities confined to muscles of the affected root(s), including the quadriceps, leg adductors, and iliopsoas, with associated paraspinal abnormalities. Saphenous sensory response remains normal even if sensory loss is prominent in the distal leg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">L5 radiculopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>L5 radiculopathy is the most common radiculopathy affecting the lumbosacral spine. It often presents with back pain that radiates down the lateral aspect of the leg into the foot. On examination, strength can be reduced in foot dorsiflexion, toe extension, foot inversion, and foot eversion. Weakness of leg abduction may also be evident in severe cases due to involvement of gluteus minimus and medius. Atrophy may be present in the extensor digitorum brevis muscle of the foot and the tibialis anterior muscle of the lower leg. In severe cases, there may be &quot;tibial ridging,&quot; a condition in which the normal convexity of the anterior compartment of the leg is lost because of atrophy, leaving a prominent sharp contour of the medial aspect of the tibial bone.</p><p>Sensory loss is confined to the lateral aspect of the lower leg and dorsum of the foot, but may be obvious only when testing sharp sensation in the web space between the first and second digits. Reflexes are generally normal, although the internal hamstring reflex may be diminished on the symptomatic side.</p><p>Electromyography and nerve conduction studies typically show abnormalities in the L5 muscles, including the gluteus medius, tensor fascia lata, semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and the L5 paraspinals. Sensory studies (sural and superficial peroneal responses) are normal since the lesion is almost always proximal to the dorsal root ganglion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">S1 radiculopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In S1 radiculopathy, pain radiates down the posterior aspect of the leg into the foot from the back. On examination, weakness of plantar flexion (gastrocnemius muscle) is specific. There may also be weakness of leg extension (gluteus maximus) and knee flexion (biceps femoris long and short heads). Sensation is generally reduced on the posterior aspect of the leg and the lateral edge of the foot. Ankle reflex loss is typical.</p><p>Electromyography and nerve conduction studies reveal abnormalities in S1 innervated muscles, including the gluteus maximus, long and short heads of the biceps femoris, gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, and the S1 paraspinals, with intact sensory responses (sural generally tested) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Soleus H reflex is usually absent in patients with significant S1 radiculopathy. Testing should be performed bilaterally to identify asymmetric amplitude loss or latency prolongation on the affected side. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve conduction studies: Late responses&quot;, section on 'H reflex'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">S2/S3/S4 radiculopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Structural radiculopathies at these lower levels are less common than other lumbosacral radiculopathies, but may be caused by a large central disc compressing the nerve roots intrathecally at a higher level (eg, L5). Patients can present with sacral or buttock pain that radiates down the posterior aspect of the leg or into the perineum. Weakness may be minimal, with urinary and fecal incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction.</p><p>The utility of electromyography and nerve conduction studies of the legs for the evaluation of S2, S3, and S4 radiculopathy is limited. However, electromyographic investigation of the low paraspinal muscles may be helpful. In addition, abnormalities may be identified in gluteus maximus and gastrocnemius. Sensory studies are normal. Prolongations in latency when performing electrical bulbocavernosus reflex testing may indicate a lesion in the region, although this is not specific for radiculopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy can be separated into three general categories from least to most severe:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pure <span class=\"nowrap\">sensory/painful</span> radicular pattern, characterized by radicular pain and a segmental pattern of sensory dysfunction but no other neurologic deficits</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild motor deficit pattern, characterized by radicular pain, sensory dysfunction, and mild nonprogressive segmental motor weakness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reflex change</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked motor deficit pattern, characterized by radicular pain and sensory dysfunction with severe or worsening motor deficits</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a lumbosacral radiculopathy is clinical, and can usually be made based upon compatible symptoms and examination findings.</p><p>Disc herniation and foraminal stenosis due to spondylotic degeneration are the most common etiologies for lumbosacral radiculopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74811 \">figure 2</a>), and clinical symptoms are self-limited in most cases. Thus, immediate diagnostic testing is not necessary for patients with suspected radiculopathy who are neurologically intact and at low risk for neoplastic, infectious, or inflammatory etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101562\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101562 \">algorithm 1</a>). Nevertheless, testing is suggested to confirm the diagnosis and etiology for patients who have persistent symptoms that are not adequately controlled with conservative therapy and who are candidates for invasive treatment options.</p><p>We recommend urgent neuroimaging in the initial assessment for patients with any of the following conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute radiculopathy with progressive neurologic deficits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiculopathy with urinary retention, saddle anesthesia, or bilateral neurologic symptoms or signs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected neoplasm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected epidural abscess</p><p/><p>If imaging is negative or equivocal, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) may be useful three weeks or more after symptom onset to identify non-structural causes of lumbosacral radiculopathy and lumbosacral polyradiculopathy.</p><p>A lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis can be diagnostic for patients with a suspected inflammatory or infectious cause of lumbosacral radiculopathy if the etiology cannot be determined in other ways. However, there are theoretical risks with lumbar puncture in the setting of epidural abscess or other epidural infectious processes. One is that lumbar puncture in the presence of complete canal obstruction by the infectious mass could cause a differential in cerebrospinal fluid pressure above and below the obstruction, leading to stretching of neural elements (ie, herniation). Another is that infection could be inadvertently carried into the intrathecal space by the lumbar puncture needle. In addition to these concerns, the diagnostic yield of lumbar puncture for epidural abscess is low, as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-epidural-abscess#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal epidural abscess&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The most useful modalities in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathy are MRI, CT, NCS, and EMG. A MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine will identify most pathologic states that may benefit from surgical intervention. CT or MRI myelography can assess the anatomy of the root sleeve. The sensitivities of CT and MRI are similar for compressive radiculopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. NCS and EMG have a high diagnostic accuracy for radiculopathy when neurologic weakness is present for at least three weeks.</p><p>Plain radiographs of the lumbar spine are of limited value in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathy. They can visualize bony structures but do not detect herniated discs. Thus, plain radiographs are not recommended in the work-up of lumbosacral radiculopathy unless there is a need to evaluate for infection, fracture, malignancy, spondylolisthesis, degenerative changes, disc space narrowing, or prior surgery. However, normal plain films do not exclude malignancy or infection in patients with a suspicious history. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults#H13667468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Modalities'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain and sensory symptoms such as paresthesia, dysesthesia, hyperesthesia, or anaesthesia that involve a specific lumbosacral dermatome are suggestive of a radicular process. Paresthesia occurs in 63 to 72 percent of cases, radiating pain in about 35 percent, and numbness in approximately 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Similarly, weakness confined to the muscles in a particular lumbosacral myotome should raise suspicion for radiculopathy, though few people spontaneously report such specific complaints. Inability to get up from a chair suggests iliopsoas or quadriceps weakness, while buckling of the knee is consistent with quadriceps weakness, and dragging of the toe points to tibialis anterior weakness.</p><p>Elucidation of triggering and alleviating factors may also be helpful. Radicular pain that worsens with Valsalva or improves while lying down suggests a compressive etiology. Conversely, radicular pain that worsens with lying down may suggest an inflammatory or neoplastic etiology. However, such symptoms have not been shown to be sensitive or specific for these conditions.</p><p>The acute onset of symptoms with bending, lifting, or trauma may herald a radiculopathy. However, none of these factors is specific for radiculopathy. <span class=\"nowrap\">Bowel/bladder</span> symptoms, particularly new urinary incontinence, suggest a cauda equina syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation for lumbosacral radiculopathy requires a careful neurologic examination. The localization of pain, sensory loss, weakness, and reflex loss can suggest involvement of specific nerve root levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75645 \">table 5</a>).</p><p>Additional procedures (eg, straight leg raising, reverse straight leg raising) may be useful but their specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility are variably limited. Vertebral tenderness is suggestive of infection but is not specific enough to be clinically useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The spine should be evaluated for any cutaneous abnormalities, such as tufts of hair, nevi, or pores that may be suggestive of a neural tube developmental abnormality.</p><p>Muscle stretch reflexes should be assessed at both the quadriceps <span class=\"nowrap\">(L2/L3/L4)</span> and Achilles (S1). The internal hamstring reflex can be useful in assessing a suspected L5 radiculopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], but its correct performance requires experience. It is sometimes difficult to elicit in heavyset people. An experienced clinician may try to elicit this reflex by tapping the semitendinosus and semimembranosus (internal hamstring muscles) tendons just proximal to the popliteal fossa. Side-to-side asymmetries are usually significant. </p><p>The sensory examination is more subjective than other parts of the neurologic examination and is further confounded by dermatomal overlap and variability. However, it can provide important information for localization. Thus, we suggest testing the relevant lumbosacral dermatomes for light touch, pain, and temperature. Vibratory sensation and proprioception are usually not useful for evaluating radiculopathies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Maneuvers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific maneuvers can be helpful in determining whether symptoms are radicular in nature. These include the straight leg raise, the contralateral straight leg raise, and the reverse straight leg raise (also referred to as femoral stretch).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The straight leg raise test is done with the patient supine. The examiner raises the patient's extended leg on the symptomatic side with the foot dorsiflexed, being careful that the patient is not actively &quot;helping&quot; in lifting the leg. Straight leg raising results in an increase in dural tension in the low lumbar and high sacral levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Las&egrave;gue's sign is the presence or worsening of radicular pain (not just low back pain or hamstring pain) with the straight leg maneuver (ie, hip flexion with the leg extended at the knee). In contrast, radicular pain is absent or unchanged when the hip is flexed with the leg in flexion at the knee. A positive Las&egrave;gue's sign usually occurs when hip flexion is between 30 and 60 degrees, though positive tests can also occur at smaller and larger degrees of hip flexion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The bowstring sign refers to the relief of radicular pain when the knee is flexed during a positive straight leg raise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The straight leg raise test is more sensitive but less specific than the contralateral straight leg raise for the diagnosis of radiculopathy due to disc herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. It is most helpful in the evaluation of radiculopathy at the L5 and S1 levels.

One study of patients with acute low back pain found that the combination of radiating pain into the leg, sensory loss in the foot, and a positive straight leg raise test was predictive of a herniated disc with nerve root compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The contralateral (crossed) straight leg raise test refers to passive elevation of the unaffected leg by the examiner.

For routine initial assessment, an MRI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77488\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77488 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81881\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81881 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F79837\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79837 \">image 3</a>) is more informative than CT because it can also identify other intraspinal pathologies, including inflammatory, malignant, and vascular disorders. In addition, MRI is not associated with ionizing radiation and is less invasive than CT myelography.</p><p>However, there is a high prevalence of abnormal neuroimaging findings in asymptomatic individuals, including some who have what appears to be frank nerve root compression by MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Furthermore, lumbar spine abnormalities on MRI in asymptomatic patients do not appear to be predictive for the future development or duration of low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Although rarely indicated, CT myelography can visualize spinal nerve roots and their trajectory through the neural foramina. It is useful for patients with intolerance of or contraindications to MRI (eg, implanted electrical devices such as cardiac pacemakers or defibrillators) when standard CT fails to define the anatomic correlates of the clinical presentation. In addition, CT myelography is preferred for patients who have surgically placed spinal hardware that produces magnetic artifacts.</p><p>A CT scan can assess osseous structures better than either plain radiography or MRI and is therefore helpful in assessing for bony disease. However, CT alone is unable to visualize nerve roots, so it is not helpful in the direct imaging of a radicular process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrodiagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary electrodiagnostic procedures for lumbosacral radiculopathy are nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG). In combination, the information provided gives insights into the integrity of spinal nerve roots and their connection with the muscles they innervate. These tests are most commonly considered in patients with persistent disabling symptoms of radiculopathy in whom neuroimaging findings are not consistent with the clinical presentation, and are most useful in the setting of neuromuscular weakness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101562\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101562 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>In a systematic review of evidence published through mid-2006, the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) assessed the utility of electrodiagnostic testing for patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The AANEM noted that the available data are limited by the lack of a universally accepted &quot;gold standard&quot; definition for the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy, thus preventing comparison of sensitivities and specificities reported by the included studies.

The yield is lower in patients with only pain or sensory loss as the manifestation of radiculopathy. For patients with nonspecific spine pain, EMG can help to distinguish pain-related reduced muscular effort from true neurogenic weakness.</p><p>In patients with weakness due to radiculopathy, NCS and EMG together can localize the specific spinal nerve root that is damaged, distinguish between old and new axon loss nerve damage, and provide indirect support for the presence of demyelinating conduction block at the root level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,46</a>]. Electrodiagnostic testing also can identify conditions that mimic radiculopathy, such as mononeuropathies of the leg or lumbosacral plexopathy. In the absence of structural abnormalities on neuroimaging, NCS and EMG can assess for the presence of nonstructural disorders of spinal nerve roots and peripheral neuropathies that mimic root disease.</p><p>From studies of the relative value of electrodiagnostic testing in the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy, the following observations have been made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EMG and imaging studies have a comparable diagnostic sensitivity, varying between 50 to 85 percent, depending on the patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. In a retrospective comparison of 47 patients who had a clinical history suggestive of either cervical or lumbosacral radiculopathy, there was congruence between EMG and MRI findings in 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Agreement between EMG and MRI was highest for patients with clearly abnormal examination findings consistent with radiculopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EMG provides physiologic information which complements the anatomic information provided by MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,50</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, these tests have overlapping diagnostic sensitivity but provide different kinds of information. When precision is needed to decide whether the neuroimaging findings are etiologically related to specific neurologic deficits, EMG is useful to support or refute this relationship. In particular, EMG may provide objective evidence of denervation when there is no motor deficit or uncertain motor deficit. In addition, EMG findings may help determine the timing of the denervation (eg, distant past versus ongoing). This is particularly useful in patients with past surgery and residual pain.</p><p>In acute radiculopathy (ie, the first three weeks), EMG and NCS provide limited but potentially important information. The needle EMG examination is more sensitive and provides better localizing information than NCS, but is not likely to show prominent features of acute axon loss until three or more weeks after symptom onset. This is due to a two to three week delay in the development of fibrillation potentials after acute motor axon loss. In the face of marked weakness from acute radiculopathy, NCS can show loss of amplitude of compound muscle action potentials by day eight after injury.</p><p>NCS are carried out by applying an electrical stimulus to the skin overlying a nerve trunk, followed by the recording of the generated electrical response over either the nerve trunk or muscle innervated by it, at some distance from the stimulation. EMG records the electrical potentials generated in a muscle belly through a needle electrode inserted in the muscle. Both methods are discussed in detail elsewhere.

In the presence of a known primary tumor, evaluation of the CSF is usually indicated only if contrast-enhanced MRI is nondiagnostic.

Most patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy will also have symptoms of low back pain. However, the majority of cases of low back pain are not due to a primary neurologic cause. Disc disease proves to be the underlying etiology in &lt;5 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Furthermore, a specific etiology cannot be reliably established for most patients with low back pain. Thus, while lumbosacral radiculopathy is one possible underlying etiology, it is not the most common.</p><p>Since the treatment of radicular and nonradicular low back pain may differ, it is important to distinguish the two.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radicular low back pain is generally associated with pain that radiates down one or both legs. There may be associated nerve root dysfunction resulting in sensory loss <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weakness that may or may not be overtly symptomatic. If the appropriate roots are involved, there may also be a loss or diminution of reflexes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonradicular low back pain is not associated with other neurologic symptoms or signs. Symptoms are generally localized to the spine and paraspinal regions and may or may not radiate into the leg. However, some patients have pain that radiates from the lower back into the buttocks and upper leg in a manner that mimics radiculopathy even though it is not due to nerve root impingement. Pain may be caused by injury of non-neurologic structures such as bone, muscle, tendon, ligament, or fascia without affecting the roots.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A history of osteoporosis should raise suspicion for vertebral body fracture as a cause for acute back pain.

Symptoms that should raise suspicion include history of malignancy, weight loss, pain at night, unvarying pain, and inability to find a position that lessens pain. </p><p/><p>Lumbosacral radiculopathies are often misdiagnosed in cases of nonradicular low back pain. This confusion is reinforced by the use of nonspecific nomenclature such as the term &quot;sciatica.&quot; Sciatica is often applied to conditions involving low back pain with or without radiation into the leg regardless the cause. Because of its nonspecific use, the term sciatica should be avoided if possible when referring to radicular pain.</p><p>Diagnostic testing for low back pain is often equivocal. In such cases, the diagnosis is typically that of nonspecific low back pain. Lumbosacral MRI may reveal findings suggestive of root compression, though the patient may not have specific radicular signs or symptoms. Persistence of findings from remote root injury and intercurrent processes such as diabetic neuropathy may also be noted on EMG, confounding the evaluation for a more acute problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common entity, often asymptomatic, that can be caused by a variety of congenital or acquired conditions. The most common etiology is degenerative spondylosis. The major manifestation is neurogenic claudication, a syndrome of bilateral, often asymmetric pain, sensory loss, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weakness affecting the legs. The symptoms are produced or exacerbated by walking or prolonged standing in an erect posture.

The entire region is commonly described as the lumbosacral spine. Directly beneath each lumbar and sacral vertebra there is a pair of neural foramina with the same number designation, such that the L1 neural foramina are located just below the L1 vertebral body. Through each neural foramen passes the same numbered spinal nerve root. On each side there are five lumbar, five sacral, and one coccygeal spinal nerve roots. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All lumbar and sacral spinal nerve roots originate at the T10 to L1 vertebral level, where the spinal cord ends as the conus medullaris. A dorsal (somatic sensory) root from the posterolateral aspect of the spinal cord and a ventral (somatic motor) root from the anterolateral aspect of the cord join in the spinal canal to form the spinal nerve root (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66123\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66123 \">figure 1</a>). The roots then course down through the intraspinal canal, forming the cauda equina, until they exit at their respective neural (intervertebral) foramina. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common etiology of lumbosacral radiculopathy is nerve root compression caused by a disc herniation or neural foraminal stenosis due to degenerative arthritis (spondylosis) affecting the spine. Congenital abnormalities of the bony spinal column or its contents include tethered cord or diastematomyelia and spina bifida. They may cause radiculopathy via traction of the root. Additional etiologies of lumbosacral radiculopathy include nonskeletal conditions such as infection, inflammation, neoplasm, and vascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology and etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar radiculopathy most commonly involves either the L5 or S1 root.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>L1 radiculopathy is rare.
