One of the most serious causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea is infection with a bacterium, <em>Clostridium difficile</em>. <em>C. difficile </em>infections are common, with approximately 500,000 cases per year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-associated-diarrhea-caused-by-clostridium-difficile-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Infection is most common in people who are hospitalized, producing disease in more than 8 hospitalized patients per 1000 (0.9 percent) in 2008 in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-associated-diarrhea-caused-by-clostridium-difficile-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic review discusses the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of <em>C. difficile</em>&ndash;associated diarrhea. Other types of diarrhea are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Acute diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS C. DIFFICILE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. difficile</em> is a disease-causing bacterium that can infect the large bowel and cause colitis. The intestinal tract of normal people contains millions of bacteria, referred to as the &quot;normal flora,&quot; that have a role in protecting the body from infection. Taking antibiotics can kill these &quot;good&quot; bacteria, allowing <em>C. difficile</em> to multiply and release toxins that damage the cells lining the intestinal wall, causing diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever as well as other symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'C. difficile symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p><em>C. difficile</em> can be found on the surface of bedside tables, door knobs, counters, lavatories, and sinks in the hospital. The organism can be spread between patients via contact with contaminated objects <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the hands of healthcare workers. Handwashing is important for preventing the spread of <em>C. difficile</em> infection. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Hand washing'</a> below.)</p><p><em>C. difficile</em> infections have become more frequent, more severe, more difficult to treat, and more likely to recur after initial treatment. Although most people become infected with <em>C. difficile</em> in the hospital, the infection has also become more common in patients who have not been hospitalized or through community-acquired infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">C. DIFFICILE RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors can increase a person's risk of becoming infected with <em>C. difficile</em>:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current or recent antibiotic use &ndash; Certain antibiotics increase the risk of becoming infected with <em>C. difficile</em> more than others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79514\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79514 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current or recent hospitalization &ndash; Up to 20 percent of people who are hospitalized and up to 50 percent of people in long-term care facilities (eg, nursing homes) carry <em>C. difficile</em> in their feces, but many do not have diarrhea or other symptoms. Exposure to these carriers significantly increases a person's risk of becoming infected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age &ndash; The risk of becoming infected with <em>C. difficile</em> is 10 times greater in people who are 65 years or older.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe illness &ndash; People who have a weakened immune system as a result of an underlying medical condition or a treatment (eg, chemotherapy) are at increased risk of becoming infected with <em>C. difficile</em>, especially during a hospital stay.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent infection with <em>C. difficile</em> &ndash; People who have been recently infected with <em>C. difficile</em> and treated have an increased risk of becoming infected again soon after stopping the treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease with colitis) &ndash; People with colitis from inflammatory bowel disease have an increased risk of developing <em>C. difficile</em> infection. In this circumstance, <em>C. difficile</em> infection may develop in the absence of prior antibiotic treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">C. DIFFICILE SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of <em>C. difficile</em> may begin during antibiotic therapy or 5 to 10 days after the antibiotic is stopped; less commonly, symptoms do not develop until as late as 10 weeks later.</p><p>The symptoms of <em>C. difficile</em> infection can vary in severity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some people (called carriers) shed the bacteria in their feces but have no signs or symptoms of the infection and can spread the infection to others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common symptoms include watery diarrhea (three or more times per day, or diarrhea associated with abdominal cramping).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In more severe cases, patients may develop profuse watery diarrhea (up to 10 to 15 times per day), blood or pus in the stool, dehydration, abdominal tenderness and cramping, fever, nausea, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Anyone who develops one or more of these symptoms should seek medical care as soon as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Life-threatening complications of <em>C. difficile</em> infection develop in a small number of people. Signs and symptoms of severe infection may include abdominal distension, severe lower abdominal pain, fever (often greater than 101&ordm;F, or 38.3&ordm;C), and profuse diarrhea. In rare cases, the bowels can rupture, potentially leading to a body-wide infection (sepsis), organ failure, or even death.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">C. DIFFICILE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of <em>C. difficile</em> is based upon laboratory analysis of a stool sample. However, the results of laboratory testing are not usually available for several hours. If there is a very high suspicion that <em>C. difficile</em> is the cause of a person's symptoms, treatment may be started before the results of the tests are available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">C. DIFFICILE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important step in treatment of <em>C. difficile</em> is to stop the antibiotic that allowed the infection to develop. If an antibiotic is necessary to treat an ongoing infection, the healthcare provider may choose an antibiotic that is less likely to allow further growth of <em>C. difficile</em>, when possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Usually an oral antibiotic (most often vancomycin or fidaxomicin) is used to treat people who are infected with <em>C. difficile</em>. It is important to take each dose of the antibiotic on time and to finish the entire course of treatment (usually 10 to 14 days).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Probiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probiotics are &quot;healthy&quot; microorganisms (bacteria, yeast) that can be taken by mouth. These probiotics do not by themselves cure <em>C. difficile</em> infection, but they may be beneficial in selected situations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-and-probiotics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile and probiotics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several studies have found that probiotics reduce the risk for antibiotic-associated diarrhea in general, but their ability to prevent <em>C. difficile</em> infection is unclear. As a result, probiotics are not recommended routinely for diarrhea related to <em>C. difficile</em> except in selected situations.</p><p>While probiotics are generally safe, case reports have described serious illness and deaths related to their use in people who were critically ill or who had a weakened immune system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of severe disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who become severely ill as a result of <em>C. difficile</em> are treated in the hospital with both oral and intravenous antibiotic and intravenous fluids. The person is monitored closely for signs of worsening disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a person fails to improve with antibiotics and supportive care and the infection worsens, surgery (removal of the colon) may be warranted; this is generally limited to people with life-threatening illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive treatments for diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diarrhea can cause a person to become dehydrated quickly, especially if it is severe. To avoid becoming dehydrated, several strategies are recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Drink adequate fluids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to drink an adequate amount of fluids to counteract the loss of fluids from diarrhea. The fluids should contain water, salt, and sugar. The fluids used for sweat replacement (eg, Gatorade) are not optimal, although they may be sufficient for an adult with diarrhea who is not dehydrated and is otherwise healthy. Diluted fruit juices and flavored soft drinks along with saltine crackers and broths or soups may also be acceptable. Fluid replacement in children should be handled differently. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Acute diarrhea in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One way to judge hydration is by observing the color of the urine and how frequently the person urinates. Normally, urine should be light yellow to nearly colorless. A person who is well hydrated normally passes urine every three to five hours. A person who urinates infrequently or has urine that is dark yellow should drink more fluids.</p><p>If a person becomes dehydrated and is unable to take fluids by mouth, a rehydration solution can be given into a vein (intravenous fluids) in a healthcare provider's office or in the emergency department.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no particular food or group of foods that is best for a person with diarrhea. However, adequate nutrition is important during an episode of acute diarrhea. For patients without an appetite, it is acceptable to consume only liquids for a short period of time. Boiled starches and cereals (eg, potatoes, noodles, rice, wheat, and oats) with salt are recommended for people with watery diarrhea; crackers, bananas, soup, and boiled vegetables may also be eaten. It is advisable to avoid fresh fruits and vegetables and milk products until the diarrhea is gone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">C. DIFFICILE PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is uncommon for people who are not taking antibiotics to become infected with <em>C. difficile</em>. However, it is still important to avoid spreading the bacteria. A person can spread the bacteria for as long as the diarrhea continues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Hand washing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hand washing is an effective way to prevent the spread of <em>C. difficile</em>. Hands should be washed after using the bathroom and before eating. Hands should ideally be wet with water and plain or antibacterial soap and rubbed together for 15 to 30 seconds. Special attention should be paid to the fingernails, between the fingers, and the wrists. Hands should be rinsed thoroughly and dried with a single-use towel. Patients and family members are encouraged to remind healthcare providers to wash their hands as well.</p><p>Alcohol-based hand rubs may be less effective against <em>C. difficile</em>; using soap and running water is recommended if there is an outbreak of <em>C. difficile</em> infection.</p><p>Fingernails that are artificial (eg, acrylic) are impossible to clean adequately, even after vigorous scrubbing or use of an antimicrobial soap. For this reason, healthcare workers are not allowed to wear artificial nails.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Contact precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who are hospitalized with <em>C. difficile</em> are placed on contact precautions, which mean that anyone who enters the patient's room must wash their hands before entering and after leaving. The person must also wear a clean gown (over their clothes) and clean gloves. These measures can help to prevent the spread of infection to other people in the hospital. Contact precautions and gowns and gloves are not recommended after patients are discharged. Person-to-person spread to family, work, or social contacts is very rare. Handwashing with soap and water after using the bathroom is recommended for all patients being treated for <em>C. difficile</em>. It is not necessary for a person who is being treated for <em>C. difficile</em> infection at home to avoid contact with friends, family, or work colleagues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">C. DIFFICILE RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrence is defined as resolution of symptoms during treatment followed by a reappearance of diarrhea and other symptoms within 90 days after treatment is completed. If symptoms return, it is important for a healthcare provider to confirm that <em>C. difficile</em> is the cause of the symptoms (rather than another condition).</p><p>Recurrence occurs in 25 percent of people who are treated with metronidazole or vancomycin and 15 percent of patients treated with fidaxomicin; in some patients, the recurrence is caused by the original infecting strain and in others by new infection with a different strain of <em>C. difficile</em>. About one-half of people who develop recurrent symptoms probably have reinfection rather than recurrence. It is not always possible to determine if a person has a recurrence or reinfection.</p><p>Most recurrences occur within one to two weeks after discontinuing antibiotic therapy, although rarely recurrence can occur up to two to three months later. People who have at least one episode of recurrent <em>C. difficile</em> have a 50 to 65 percent chance of additional episodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A first episode of relapse is treated in the same manner as initial infection (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'C. difficile treatment'</a> above). People who develop subsequent relapses of <em>C. difficile</em> (eg, a third or fourth episode) may be treated with one or more of the following strategies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longer treatment with vancomycin that is slowly tapered over a 6- to 12-week period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other antibiotics, such as rifaximin, may be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A treatment known as a &quot;fecal transplant&quot; may be considered in certain situations. Fecal transplant involves administration of stool (via colonoscopy, by enema, or sometimes via a tube into the upper intestine) donated by a healthy person to a person who has recurrent <em>C. difficile </em>infection. Fecal transplant is used for patients who have not responded to multiple courses of antibiotics.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our <a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=3991\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.
