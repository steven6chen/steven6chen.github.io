Patients who experience at least four episodes during a 12-month period are classified as &ldquo;rapid cycling&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The subtypes of bipolar disorder include bipolar I and bipolar II. Patients with bipolar I disorder experience manic episodes, and nearly always experience major depressive and hypomanic episodes. Bipolar II disorder is marked by at least one hypomanic episode, at least one major depressive episode, and the absence of manic episodes. Additional information about the clinical features and diagnosis of bipolar disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H4503550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Rapid cycling specifies a particular course of illness that can occur in bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder, rather than a subtype of bipolar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The diagnostic criteria for rapid cycling are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least four mood episodes in a 12-month period. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The episodes meet both the symptom and duration criteria for mania, hypomania, or major depression; the episodes that occur as part of a rapid cycling pattern are no different from episodes that occur as part of a non-rapid cycling pattern. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The episodes are demarcated by a period of partial or full remission for at least two months, or by a switch to an episode of opposite polarity. Manic and hypomanic are counted as being on the same pole; thus, a switch in polarity involves one of these episodes and an episode of major depression. </p><p/><p>Additional information about the clinical features and diagnosis of rapid cycling are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid cycling bipolar disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86794887\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite clinical differences among manic and hypomanic episodes, for the purpose of treatment they are considered to be similar and thus treated with the same medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In addition, the treatment of manic and hypomanic episodes in patients with rapid cycling bipolar disorder is comparable to the treatment of mania or hypomania in general. </p><p>We suggest that clinicians generally avoid using antidepressants in patients with rapid cycling bipolar disorder. This approach is consistent with practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Remission of a particular rapid cycling mood episode often occurs as a result of the course of illness, rather than treatment. Thus, the primary goal of treatment is to prevent further episodes.</p><p>Response to pharmacotherapy appears to be poorer in rapid cycling bipolar disorder than non-rapid cycling bipolar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. A meta-analysis of nine studies (primarily observational, 1424 bipolar patients) examined improvement of mood episodes and rates of recurrence in rapid cycling and non-rapid cycling patients, and found that an inferior response to medications was more probable in rapid cycling patients (risk ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Clinicians may find that it is not feasible for rapid cycling patients to fully remit from a mood episode or avoid recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and that a more realistic goal is to improve functioning and reduce the frequency, intensity, and duration of mood episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The difficulties posed by rapid cycling usually necessitate referral to a psychiatrist. </p><p>The mood episodes that occur during rapid cycling are demarcated by a period of euthymia for at least two months, or by a switch from an episode of one polarity to an episode of the other polarity (eg, major depression to mania) without intervening euthymia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Rapid cycling that is characterized by continuous switching between poles may respond more poorly to treatment than rapid cycling that includes intermittent periods of euthymia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Poor adherence to pharmacotherapy occurs in 20 to 40 percent of rapid cycling bipolar patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>], and appears to be more common in rapid cycling than non-rapid cycling patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nonadherence in bipolar disorder is often managed with psychoeducation, but this has not been studied in rapid cycling patients. Adherence to treatment and use of psychoeducation in bipolar disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Choosing maintenance treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2066405\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring the patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid cycling bipolar patients should be monitored for therapeutic and adverse medication effects, with particular attention to suicidal ideation and psychosis. The frequency of monitoring is determined by the patient&rsquo;s clinical status. Hospitalized patients are monitored daily. Outpatients are commonly seen on a weekly basis until they have responded (ie, the patient&rsquo;s safety has stabilized and the number, intensity, and frequency of psychotic and mood symptoms has improved substantially). Following response, patients can be seen every two to four weeks until they remit. Many authorities suggest that patients or caregivers record daily symptoms in a mood diary to help judge the effectiveness of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, this is not standard practice.</p><p>For rapid cycling bipolar patients who remit and remain stable, monitoring can be tapered, with progressively longer intervals between assessments. As an example, a patient who is seen every two weeks at the time of remission can be seen every two weeks for one to three more visits, then every month for one to three visits, and then every two months for one to three visits. Continuously stable patients can ultimately be seen every three to six months. More frequent visits should be scheduled for patients who develop symptoms or side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H289533874\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of treatment trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For rapid cycling bipolar patients, we suggest that clinicians try to prescribe a particular treatment regimen for at least two to four months before determining whether it effectively improves acute symptoms and reduces the frequency, intensity, and duration of recurrent mood episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/11,13,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6997118\"><span class=\"h1\">SEVERE EPISODES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe mania is characterized by one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suicidal ideation or behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homicidal ideation or behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotic features (ie, delusions or hallucinations)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor judgement that places the patient or others at imminent risk of being harmed (eg, impulsively moving across the country without any planning) </p><p/><p>Severely ill patients generally require hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/5,6,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,23</a>]. </p><p>For rapid cycling bipolar patients with severe mania, we usually use a medication combination, which is consistent with the recommendation of treatment practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/5,6,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,23</a>] and many authorities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-in-adults-treatment-of-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/9,11,15,22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,15,22,24</a>].

The episodes that occur during rapid cycling are no different from episodes that occur as part of a non-rapid cycling pattern. Separate episodes are demarcated from each other either by a switch from one pole to the other (eg, major depression to mania), or by full or partial remission for at least two months. (See <a href=\"#H81537125\" class=\"local\">'Definition of rapid cycling bipolar disorder'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-cycling-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H16495348\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid cycling bipolar disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antidepressants are generally avoided in patients with rapid cycling. Remission of a particular rapid cycling mood episode often occurs as a result of the course of illness, rather than treatment. Thus, the primary goal of treatment is to prevent further episodes. (See <a href=\"#H86794887\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For rapid cycling bipolar patients with severe mania, we suggest initial treatment with a medication combination rather than monotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
