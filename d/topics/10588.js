Most stones &le;4 mm in diameter pass spontaneously. Stone diameter &ge;5 mm is associated with a progressive decrease in the spontaneous passage rate, which is unlikely with stones &ge;10 mm in diameter. Proximal ureteral stones are also less likely to pass spontaneously. The data supporting these conclusions are presented elsewhere.

The ureteral stone that must be removed requires the use of a modality such as lithotripsy or endoscopic removal. Developments in shock wave lithotripsy technologies, with electrohydraulic and laser lithotripsy, have improved intracorporeal stone fragmentation. Advances in endoscopic modalities, with the development of rigid, and later, semi-rigid and flexible fiberoptic ureteroscopes, has made the entire ureter and renal pelvis accessible for the treatment of ureteral and renal stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Advances in the fiberoptic lens systems enabled manufacture of smaller ureteroscopes that can traverse the ureter without prior dilation. The use of a ureteral access sheath has greatly simplified passage of the ureteroscope, thereby facilitating ureteroscopic access to the mid- and proximal ureter, as well as to the intrarenal collecting system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13011188\"><span class=\"h3\">Ureteroscopy versus shock wave lithotripsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ureteroscopy and shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) are the two most commonly used surgical techniques in patients who require removal of ureteral stones. Available data, including the meta-analyses discussed below, suggest that ureteroscopy should be considered the first line treatment for the management of most calculi requiring surgical removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>], especially in patients with large ureteral stones or complex renal anatomy and in patients who are obese or have a high risk of bleeding. SWL may be as effective as ureteroscopy for the treatment for small (less than 1 cm) stones in the proximal ureter.</p><p>The outcomes associated with ureteroscopy and SWL were compared in a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials including 1205 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These trials were heterogeneous with respect to duration of follow-up (two weeks to three months), stone location (proximal ureteral in two, mid-ureteral in one, and distal ureteral in four), type of ureteroscope, and type of lithotriptor. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stone-free rate was significantly better with ureteroscopy as compared with SWL (92 versus 77 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, the need for retreatment was significantly lower with ureteroscopy (3 versus 21 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, procedure-related complications were significantly more frequent with ureteroscopy (16 versus 9 percent), although most complications were minor and required no intervention. In addition, ureteroscopy required longer hospital stays (by 2.5 days); however, hospitalization after ureteroscopy was routine practice in countries where some of the trials were performed but is <strong>not</strong> routine in the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative symptoms were similar between the groups, although patients assigned SWL required more postoperative analgesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the superiority of ureteroscopy did not appear to be influenced by the ureteral location of the stone, only two trials examined patients with proximal ureteral stones and only one enrolled patients with small proximal calculi. This trial was characterized by a high risk of bias, including concerns about randomization and blinding. Thus, it is not clear that ureteroscopy is superior to SWL for treatment of small stones in the proximal ureter.</p><p/><p>A second meta-analysis, which included most of the same trials, reached similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition to the data presented above, stone size and patient characteristics must be considered in choosing a modality:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large stones (greater than 10 mm in diameter) may be difficult to treat with SWL.

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy or laparoscopy offer minimally invasive treatment options for the removal of large or severely impacted ureteral calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>].</p><p/><p>A detailed discussion of the benefits and complications of surgical modalities associated with stone removal is presented separately.

However, with proximal ureteral stones that are larger than 10 mm, flexible ureteroscopy combined with holmium laser lithotripsy and intraoperative fragment retrieval offers optimal results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Shock wave lithotripsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large number of centers use in situ shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) monotherapy to treat proximal ureteral stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. With upper ureteral stones, first and second generation lithotriptors that employ fluoroscopy reportedly achieve stone-free rates between 60 and 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. SWL can occasionally be tedious with second generation units in which ultrasound is used for localization. Decreasing the shock wave rate from 120 to 60 shocks per minute may result in a significant increase in stone-free rates, from 49 to 65 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Proximal ureteral calculi may be pushed into the renal pelvis to facilitate SWL visualization, targeting, and fragmentation (the so-called &quot;push-bang&quot; technique). Placement of a ureteral stent also appears to aid in the fragmentation and visualization of the stone.</p><p>SWL is most effective in fragmenting small (&le;1 cm in diameter) calcium stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/11,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17-19</a>]. By comparison, the technique leaves residual stone fragments in approximately 35 to 55 percent of patients with larger renal stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Adjunctive measures may increase the passage rate of ureteral stone fragments following shock wave lithotripsy. In an open label trial, patients with single proximal ureteral calculi were randomly assigned to receive either 0.4 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamsulosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamsulosin</a> or no therapy during treatment of their stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The stone-free rate was significantly higher in the patients treated with tamsulosin (55 versus 25 percent). However, this treatment did not appear to provide a significant advantage in terms of decreasing pain associated with SWL treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Flexible ureteroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ureteral access sheaths allow for rapid and safe passage of the flexible ureteroscope into the proximal ureter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, proximal ureteral calculi may be approached endoscopically and fragmented primarily with holmium laser lithotripsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Holmium laser lithotripsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laser lithotripsy of proximal ureteral calculi has proven to be highly effective and is considered by many urologists the treatment of choice for stones in this location. Fragmentation rates for cystine and calcium oxalate monohydrate calculi, which were difficult to treat with early laser prototypes, have been greatly improved with larger, higher power laser fibers and through the use the holmium laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Stone-free rates are reported to be near 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/11,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23-25</a>].</p><p>Some evidence suggests that stone fragments produced by holmium laser lithotripsy should be actively retrieved and removed during the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This was demonstrated in 60 patients undergoing ureteroscopy and holmium laser lithotripsy who were randomly assigned to either intraoperative fragment retrieval or to exhaustive lithotripsy with anticipated spontaneous fragment expulsion during the postoperative period. Patients who did not have intraoperative fragment retrieval had the following adverse outcomes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significantly higher rate of unplanned visits to the emergency department (3 versus 30 percent, OR 12.4, 95% CI 1.8-80.3)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trends toward higher rates of rehospitalization (0 versus 10 percent, p = 0.24), need for ancillary treatment (0 versus 7 percent, p = 0.49), and lower stone-free rate (100 versus 87 percent, p = 0.1)</p><p/><p>These results suggest that not actively retrieving fragments during ureteroscopy and holmium laser lithotripsy is associated with a higher risk of morbidity and medical utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, it is now our practice to actively retrieve all stone fragments during ureteroscopic holmium laser stone fragmentation.</p><p>Fragment retrieval can be facilitated by deploying various &quot;backstop&quot; devices proximal to the stone prior to fragmentation to prevent them from migrating back into the renal pelvis. This technique was tested in a randomized trial of 113 patients with large proximal ureteral calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Compared with patients who did not have backstop devices placed above the stone, those with deployed devices during surgery had significantly lower rates of fragment migration into the renal pelvis (0 versus 12 percent), and trends toward higher stone-free rates (100 versus 91 percent), lower rates of hospitalization (0 versus 4 percent), and fewer visits to the emergency department (7 versus 12 percent).</p><p>The use of ureteroscopy with intracorporeal lithotripsy is highly effective in treating stones &gt;1 cm in diameter and appears to be superior to lithotripsy in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Combined treatment with flexible ureteroscopy and holmium laser lithotripsy can also be used for the removal of very large (&gt;2 to 3 cm in diameter) or impacted stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Percutaneous antegrade approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The percutaneous antegrade approach is another viable treatment option. In one series, 35 of 37 proximal ureteral calculi and 20 of 20 mid-ureteral calculi were successfully removed intact by flexible nephroscopy, fragmented with either electrohydraulic or ultrasonic lithotripsy, or basketed under fluoroscopic guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The percutaneous approach is usually reserved for large, impacted proximal ureteral calculi.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Retroperitoneal laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retroperitoneal laparoscopy is a viable option for very large or severely impacted mid- or proximal ureteral calculi. Success rates of 100 percent with minimal patient morbidity have been reported when utilizing established laparoscopic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/10,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,28</a>]. In a randomized trial of 48 patients with proximal or mid-ureteral stones requiring surgical removal, stone removal with both the antegrade approach and the retroperitoneal approach were equally successful; however, the retroperitoneal approach was associated with less postoperative pain, a lower incidence of paralytic ileus, and shorter hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MID-URETERAL CALCULI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of calculi in the mid-ureter has become significantly less troublesome with the advent of the flexible ureteroscope and associated instrumentation used for in situ fragmentation. With improved fluoroscopic imaging, shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) can now be used for mid-ureteral stone fragmentation. The highest stone-free rates and lowest number of required retreatments are associated with ureteroscopy with holmium laser lithotripsy. Thus, flexible ureteroscopy is generally preferred over in situ SWL for midureteral stones.</p><p>Early studies reported low stone-free rates for mid-ureteral calculi using SWL. These relatively poor results appear to be due in part to patient position when treated. As an example, with the patient in the prone position, one series reported a 94 percent stone-free rate with treatment on the HM-3 lithotriptor. This position decreases the attenuation of shock waves that is normally encountered with traditional shock wave entry through the patient's back.</p><p>Because of the bony pelvis and sacrum as well as the lack of easily identified sonographic landmarks, SWL of mid-ureteral calculi using second generation ultrasound-guided lithotriptors has presented significant difficulty. Despite these problems, some series have reported stone-free rates in excess of 75 percent for in situ treatment of mid-ureteral stones using ultrasound-guided lithotriptors. As with proximal ureteral stones, mid-ureteral calculi may be pushed into the renal pelvis for &quot;routine&quot; shock wave lithotripsy.</p><p>Mid-ureteral stones are easily accessible by both rigid and flexible ureteroscopy. Small diameter semi-rigid fiberoptic ureteroscopes obviate the need for dilatation while providing excellent optics, thereby enabling the urologist to treat ureteral calculi in a minimally invasive fashion, and in select cases, under only sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In most series, stones in the mid-ureter that are treated with ureteroscopy are removed in 80 to 95 percent of cases with electrohydraulic lithotripsy, laser, or pneumatic lithotripsy, with or without basketing. A number of less expensive, low power holmium lasers are now available, making laser stone fragmentation the preferred method of stone removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DISTAL URETERAL STONES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many clinicians, ureteroscopy is the preferred treatment of distal ureteral calculi. However, shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is used in some centers. Failure of both treatment options may require antegrade percutaneous management or (in extremely rare cases) open or laparoscopic ureterolithotomy.</p><p>Several investigators have advocated the use of SWL, with the patient in a prone or modified sitting position, for the treatment of distal and prevesicular stones. One study found an 87 percent stone-free rate with one treatment on the HM-3 lithotriptor when patients were placed in the prone position. Similar results have been noted in other series using the Dornier HM-3 lithotriptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>By contrast, another study of patients with distal ureteral stones (mean diameter 7.8 mm) found that the proportion of patients who were stone free after one treatment was better with transgluteal (supine) as compared with prone positioning (78 versus 40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], suggesting that placing patients in a supine position on the lithotripter is a superior approach.</p><p>Treatment of distal ureteral stones with rigid ureteroscopy has also proven to be reliable and safe; it requires less technical expertise than with more proximal calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Lower ureteral stones can be removed by ureteroscopy in approximately 90 to 99 percent of cases. Compared with SWL, ureteroscopy produces superior stone-free rates. (See <a href=\"#H13011188\" class=\"local\">'Ureteroscopy versus shock wave lithotripsy'</a> above.)</p><p>Laser lithotripsy is currently considered the method of choice for stone fragmentation and is also effective in greater than 95 percent of distal ureteral stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Many clinicians routinely place a ureteral stent following ureteroscopic management of distal ureteral calculi to minimize postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, the absence of stent placement appears to be safe during uncomplicated procedures and may be associated with less pain and fewer urinary symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENT STONE FORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even after successful therapy, the stone-free rate is generally only approximately 75 percent at 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H21126001\" class=\"local\">'Emergency therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Medical therapy</strong> &ndash; In a patient who has a newly diagnosed ureteral stone &lt;10 mm and whose symptoms are controlled, observation with periodic evaluation is an option for initial treatment. Patients who elect for an attempt at spontaneous passage or medical expulsive therapy should have well-controlled pain, no clinical evidence of sepsis, and adequate renal functional reserve. (See <a href=\"#H21126008\" class=\"local\">'Medical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Surgical therapy</strong> &ndash; In patients in whom emergency therapy is not indicated, stone removal may be performed in the presence of persistent obstruction, failure of stone progression, or in the presence of increasing or unremitting colic. In patients who require stone removal, the two most commonly applied techniques are ureteroscopy and shock wave lithotripsy (SWL). Ureteroscopy produces better stone-free rates and a reduced need for retreatment. (See <a href=\"#H21126027\" class=\"local\">'Surgical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of <strong>proximal</strong> <strong>ureteral calculi</strong> depends upon the size of the stone. For small proximal ureteral calculi (less than 10 mm), SWL and ureteroscopy are both considered first-line therapy. However, with proximal ureteral stones that are larger than 10 mm, flexible ureteroscopy combined with holmium laser lithotripsy and intraoperative fragment retrieval offers optimal results. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Proximal ureteral calculi'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <strong>mid-ureteral stones</strong>, the highest stone-free rates and lowest number of required re-treatments are seen with ureteroscopy with holmium laser lithotripsy; thus, flexible ureteroscopy is generally preferred over SWL. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Mid-ureteral calculi'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best initial option for the treatment of <strong>distal ureteral stones </strong>is ureteroscopy (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Distal ureteral stones'</a> above). However, stone-free rates are high with both techniques and some clinicians prefer SWL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other surgical techniques, including percutaneous anterograde ureteroscopy and retroperitoneal laparoscopy, are usually reserved for large, impacted ureteral calculi when less invasive techniques are unlikely to be successful. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Percutaneous antegrade approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Retroperitoneal laparoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with active stone disease should undergo evaluation for, and appropriate treatment of, metabolic abnormalities that predispose to stone formation, such as hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria, or hypocitraturia. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent stone formation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ureteral-calculi/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Borofsky MS, Walter D, Shah O, et al.
