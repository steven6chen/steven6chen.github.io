A discussion of options for pain relief should accompany the evaluation for the etiology of the throat pain, which is most likely to be a self-limiting virus, less likely a bacterium requiring antibiotics (eg,<em> Streptococcus</em> or gonococcus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and much less likely, a very serious infection (eg, epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscess, deep space infections, or acute human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]).</p><p>The evaluation of acute pharyngitis is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults#H316692798\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pharyngitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2933074502\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to symptom control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain relief approaches for acute pharyngitis in adults include systemic oral analgesics, topical therapies, and environmental measures. These approaches have not been directly compared. Considerations when choosing among them include patient factors (eg, sore throat symptom severity, presence of concomitant symptoms, and any patient comorbidities) and therapy-related factors (eg, rapidity of onset of action, duration of effective relief, and side effect profile of each treatment). In general, we suggest a systemic oral analgesic. However, topical therapies are reasonable for patients who want to avoid systemic therapy or are at higher risk for side effects from systemic therapy. Additionally, using more than one therapy could provide the most effective symptom relief. If patients use more than one pharmacologic therapy, they should be cognizant of active ingredients in the preparations to avoid exceeding the recommended dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over-the-counter oral analgesics, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, typically have a duration of effectiveness of several hours. They generally act within one to two hours to relieve sore throat symptoms due to acute pharyngitis. Oral analgesics act systemically; thus, they will address concomitant symptoms that may accompany sore throat, such as fever or headache. The choice among oral analgesics, and permissible maximum dosages, may be limited by such factors as renal or hepatic dysfunction or by current or prior gastric irritation or reflux symptoms. We typically start at a low dose and titrate up. (See <a href=\"#H3496513253\" class=\"local\">'Choosing an oral analgesic'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical treatments applied locally to the throat via lozenge or spray, or via beverages or foods (eg, ice, tea, soup, and honey), are generally quicker-acting than oral analgesics, and they typically have a shorter duration of pain relief which may necessitate frequent re-dosing. There is no evidence that a particular topical lozenge or spray is superior in efficacy. The choice among them is dependent on availability and clinician or patient preference. We do encourage patients to consume warm fluids, teas with honey, and soups and to melt ice chips or popsicles in their mouths before swallowing them. (See <a href=\"#H2014882\" class=\"local\">'Therapies applied topically to the throat'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Nonpharmacologic environmental approaches may also be of benefit. These approaches include adjusting humidity to avoid a dry environment and avoiding exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke. (See <a href=\"#H64844005\" class=\"local\">'Helpful environmental approaches'</a> below.)</p><p>Glucocorticoid treatment is generally not recommended due to the potential for harms balanced against the only slight improvement in rate of pain reduction as compared with oral analgesics. However, steroids may be appropriate in the exceptional patient who presents with severe throat pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inability to swallow. (See <a href=\"#H1569839195\" class=\"local\">'Limited role of glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p>If the patient&rsquo;s only symptom is throat pain, we discourage use of multisymptom preparations (eg, combination analgesic and decongestant) containing ingredients to improve symptoms the patient is not experiencing, in order to minimize the side effect potential.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10113532\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid antibiotic overprescribing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prescribing antibiotics that are not indicated for a specific infection puts the patient at risk for antibiotic side effects and increases the community risk of bacterial resistance. Additionally, prescribing antibiotics for sore throat increases the likelihood that a patient will make return visits to medical providers for similar symptoms, presumably due to &quot;medicalization&quot; of a typically self-limited illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Even when appropriately treating documented bacterial pathogens such as group A <em>Streptococcus</em>, antibiotics contribute minimally to the speed with which symptoms of pharyngitis improve. Nonetheless, overtreatment of acute pharyngitis continues to represent a major cause of inappropriate antibiotic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In an effort to avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, we discuss the risks and benefits of antibiotic and non-antibiotic approaches, including the value of non-antibiotic pain relief; validate patient&rsquo;s goals and concerns; educate them about the expected clinical course and time to improvement; and emphasize open communication to bring worsening symptoms or lack or expected improvement to attention. This discussion may be facilitated by use of patient education material (see <a href=\"#H13201699\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> below).

Only 38 percent were hoping specifically for an antibiotic prescription. Further, the subgroup of patients who considered receipt of an antibiotic very or rather important valued pain relief more than those who considered an antibiotic of little or no importance. The multivariate analysis showed that hope for pain relief remained a strong predictor of the desire to receive an antibiotic prescription, suggesting that patients believe an antibiotic offers the best approach for achieving this goal. Additionally, data from a study of pediatric visits for upper respiratory infections showed that unnecessary antibiotic usage decreased and patient satisfaction increased when education was provided both about how to decrease symptoms and about why antibiotics were not indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261420865\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC ORAL THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic oral therapy is quite effective at reducing pain of acute pharyngitis in adults. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) remain the two most rigorously studied for this indication. The use of glucocorticoids for treatment of most sore throat pain is generally not suggested due to the potential for serious side effects compared with the slight reduction in duration of sore throat pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3496513253\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing an oral analgesic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral analgesics are readily available, and systematic reviews and randomized trials have confirmed the efficacy of each systemic analgesic studied for treating acute sore throat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/9-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-16</a>]. Data from randomized trials suggest that NSAIDs are more effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/9,10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,17</a>]. However, it is uncertain whether the efficacy benefit is clinically meaningful in treating pharyngitis. &#160; </p><p>Given the lack of clear evidence of clinical superiority of a particular agent, the choice of systemic analgesic may be guided by patient preference, which is often based on prior favorable experience with a particular agent. However, it is important for patients with certain comorbidities to avoid choosing an oral analgesic which could exacerbate them; for example, patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, ulcer history, or significant renal insufficiency should be advised to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> due to the potential for gastrointestinal irritation or bleeding or worsening renal function with NSAIDs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>.

Several randomized trials in different countries among patients with acute pharyngitis have shown that ibuprofen produces a significantly greater reduction in sore throat pain compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/9,10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,18</a>]. As an example, a United States double-blind randomized trial of 120 outpatients with acute sore throat compared ibuprofen 400 mg, acetaminophen 1000 mg, and placebo, using a visual analog scale (0 to 100) to measure pain intensity compared with baseline. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen were similarly effective at two hours; at three to six hours, pain reduction was greater with ibuprofen than acetaminophen (pain intensity difference 75 versus 50 at three hours). Compared with placebo, both ibuprofen and acetaminophen reduced pain intensity over the six hours studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2181155256\"><span class=\"h3\">Aspirin efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> has demonstrated effective sore throat relief from one through six hours after ingestion. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 272 adult patients with acute sore throat associated with other symptoms of upper respiratory infection, aspirin (two 400 mg effervescent tablets in water) reduced the intensity of sore throat pain at two, four, and six hours in the intervention group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Headaches and muscle <span class=\"nowrap\">aches/pains</span> were also significantly reduced in the treatment group, with no serious adverse events reported. In another randomized controlled study of 177 adult patients with acute sore throat, time to meaningful pain relief and pain intensity were decreased in the group treated with a fast-release aspirin formulation (two 500 mg tablets containing sodium carbonate as a disintegrant and small particles of aspirin) compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H980359264\"><span class=\"h3\">Acetaminophen efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> 1000 mg decreases acute sore throat pain by approximately 50 percent after three hours.

The use of glucocorticoids depends on severity of illness and should be restricted to the exceptional patient who presents with severe throat pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inability to swallow.</p><p>Although there is evidence that glucocorticoid use can slightly decrease the duration of throat pain, analgesics such as NSAIDs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> are also effective and carry significantly less risk of toxicities such as serious mood changes or hyperglycemia, which are well described with short-term steroid use. For similar reasons, IDSA guidelines recommend against the use of glucocorticoids for patients with streptococcal pharyngitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not recommend using a corticosteroid for acute sore throat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Others have made a weak recommendation for a single dose of oral corticosteroids for symptom relief of pharyngitis, emphasizing shared decision-making with the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Systematic reviews of randomized trials assessing the efficacy of glucocorticoids for pain reduction in acute pharyngitis have generally found only modest benefit (slightly quicker reduction of pain by up to approximately half a day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/14,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23-25</a>]. In one meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials that included 1426 children and adults, one to two days of adjunctive glucocorticoids (oral or intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) reduced the time to pain relief onset by approximately five hours (7.4 versus 12.3 hours) and the time to complete pain resolution by 11 hours (33 versus 44 hours) compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A higher proportion of patients taking glucocorticoids had complete pain resolution at 24 to 48 hours.

Glucocorticoid formulations given were heterogeneous, given at different doses and time intervals and by different routes of administration.</p><p>Most of the trials occurred in the emergency setting, so generalizability to patients in an office setting is uncertain. In one office-based randomized controlled trial that evaluated a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 10 mg for adults who visited a primary care clinician for acute pharyngitis and were not given an immediate prescription for antibiotics, the benefit was also small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There was no difference between dexamethasone and placebo in the rate of full sore throat relief at 24 hours; there was only a small difference at 48 hours (35 versus 27 percent with placebo, relative risk [RR] 1.31, 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.68).</p><p>Although no difference in rates of adverse side effects was seen with short-term glucocorticoid use, in some studies the number of patients studied was too small to detect potentially rare but serious toxicities resulting from even such limited courses of steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-treatment-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].

Contrary to provider preconceptions, receiving an antibiotic prescription is not a top priority for patients seeking care. Overtreatment of acute pharyngitis represents a major cause of inappropriate antibiotic use. (See <a href=\"#H397016704\" class=\"local\">'General concepts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an effort to avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, we discuss the risks and benefits of antibiotic and non-antibiotic approaches, including the value of non-antibiotic pain relief; validate patient&rsquo;s goals and concerns; educate them about the expected clinical course and time to improvement; and emphasize open communication to bring worsening symptoms or lack or expected improvement to attention. (See <a href=\"#H10113532\" class=\"local\">'Avoid antibiotic overprescribing'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings#H1246766814\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial stewardship in outpatient settings&quot;, section on 'Education and expertise'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain relief approaches for acute pharyngitis in adults include systemic oral analgesics, topical therapies, and environmental measures. Considerations when choosing among them include patient factors (eg, sore throat symptom severity, presence of concomitant symptoms, and any patient comorbidities) and therapy-related factors (eg, rapidity of onset of action, duration of effective relief, and side effect profile of each treatment) (see <a href=\"#H2933074502\" class=\"local\">'Approach to symptom control'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients, we suggest a systemic oral analgesic (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug [NSAID], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) rather than topical therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and aspirin have all been shown to provide sore throat pain relief; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> appears to be somewhat more effective than acetaminophen, although it is uncertain if the efficacy benefit is clinically meaningful in treating pharyngitis. The choice among them depends on patient preference after taking into account the side effect profile of the treatment(s) in the context of the patient&rsquo;s comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H261420865\" class=\"local\">'Systemic oral therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Topical therapies alone are a reasonable alternative for patients who want to avoid systemic therapy or are at higher risk for side effects from it, but their duration of effectiveness is shorter than for systemic therapies. It is also reasonable to use topical therapies in combination with systemic therapy. Topical therapies in the form of lozenges or sprays have the advantages of direct application to the affected throat area, rapid onset of action, and minimal toxicity risk. It may also be helpful for patients to consume warm fluids, teas with honey, and soups and to let ice chips or popsicles melt in their mouth. (See <a href=\"#H2014882\" class=\"local\">'Therapies applied topically to the throat'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest not using glucocorticoids on a routine basis for the relief of pain associated with an acute sore throat (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We restrict their use to the exceptional patient who presents with severe throat pain and the inability to swallow. Glucocorticoids modestly reduce the duration of throat pain; however, other analgesic agents (eg, NSAIDs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) are also effective and carry less risk of toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H1569839195\" class=\"local\">'Limited role of glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If patients use more than one pharmacologic therapy, they should be cognizant of active ingredients in the preparations to avoid exceeding the recommended dose of any ingredient.
