Both methods offer highly effective, reversible, noncoital-based contraception, but are subject to adverse estrogen-related side effects. However, transdermal hormonal contraceptive systems offer several potential advantages to oral contraceptive pills:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic effects are achieved at lower peak doses since first-pass hepatic metabolism and enzymatic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract are avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma hormone levels remain constant (peaks and troughs do not occur).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sustained drug delivery reduces the need for frequent self-administration, and thus may improve patient compliance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nonoral route of administration is useful for patients who have difficulty swallowing pills.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate cessation of drug administration is possible with removal of the transdermal system.</p><p/><p>Although data are limited, there is a possibility of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patch users compared to users of estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives.</p><p>Of note, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning to providers and consumers about on-line sales of counterfeit contraceptive patches, as well as other drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STRUCTURE AND PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transdermal contraceptive patch is a matrix system composed of three layers: the outer layer is water-resistant and protects the underlying layer from the environment, the middle layer is medicated and adhesive, and the inner layer is a clear release liner which is removed before patch application.</p><p>The medicated layer contains two hormones, ethinyl estradiol (EE) and norelgestromin, the primary active metabolite of norgestimate. Approximately 20 to 35 mcg of EE and 150 mcg norelgestromin are released daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The average overall EE concentration (&quot;area under the curve&quot;) in patch users is 60 percent higher than in women who use a 35-mcg EE pill; however, peak EE concentrations are 25 percent lower than in pill users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The area under the curve may be comparable to that of a 50-mcg EE oral contraceptive pill.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives (pill, patch, ring) have a similar contraceptive mechanism. The most important mechanism for providing contraception is <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progestin-induced</span> inhibition of the midcycle surge of gonadotropin secretion so that ovulation does not occur. Another potential mechanism is suppression of gonadotropin secretion during the follicular phase of the cycle, thereby preventing follicular maturation. Progestin-related mechanisms also contribute to the contraceptive effect. These include changes in cervical mucus, fallopian tube motility, and endometrial receptivity that have unfavorable effects on fertilization and implantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of action'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H775305672\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transdermal contraception is highly effective and as effective as oral combined hormonal contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This was illustrated in three clinical trials that evaluated contraceptive efficacy in transdermal contraceptive patch users and oral contraceptive users; one trial was a non-comparative study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and two were randomized clinical trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77359\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77359 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Both the typical use and method use (perfect compliance with the dosing schedule) pregnancy rates were less than one pregnancy per 100 woman-years.</p><p>The similarity between the typical and method patch use rates suggests that women in the trials were able to use the patch correctly without difficulty. This finding is supported by an analysis of self-reported rates of &quot;perfect&quot; compliance of patch users versus oral contraceptive users which showed that users of the transdermal contraceptive patch achieved perfect compliance more often than oral contraceptive users (88 versus 78 percent of cycles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The rate of perfect compliance did not vary by age for patch users, while oral contraceptive users who were in younger age groups had lower perfect compliance rates.</p><p>Obesity may carry an increased risk of contraceptive failure, but this is controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraception-counseling-for-obese-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraception counseling for obese women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ADMINISTRATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women desiring a reversible, nonevent-based method of contraception who have no contraindications to use of estrogens or progestins constitute the initial population of potential users. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Administration'</a>.)</p><p>Women may choose the patch over estrogen-progestin pills because of its ease of administration and convenience (ie, no pill to swallow and the patch is self-administered weekly rather than daily), but the patch is less private since it may be visible. The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-vaginal-ring-ethinyl-estradiol-and-etonogestrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">contraceptive vaginal ring</a> also offers ease of administration and convenience (ie, no pill to swallow and monthly self-administration), but the woman or her partner may not want to accept potential issues related to vaginal contraception (eg, inserting the ring into the vagina, increased vaginal discharge, feeling the ring during intercourse). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraindications to patch use are the same as those for other estrogen-progestin contraceptives (eg, history of thromboembolism, an estrogen dependent tumor, abnormal liver function). The World Health Organization (WHO) and <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/pdf/summary-chart-us-medical-eligibility-criteria_508tagged.pdf&amp;token=jEVGVo6WqsDq698K1C6vDPPjIqTfzg54vW4qWS3doblDMO+X3NN/ro6R0xwK/I6IOwBh6DyNhV/q6vrv3T8nCaRCrZsEC+Wz9FPYFmXFzWEhd9uzeVTKQGeWKf6mT23Z1X5qsRVoFq27I5l+8ZoObQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5320\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> have published medical eligibility criteria for use of hormonal contraceptives, including transdermal contraception. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection#H4007070790\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;, section on 'Medical issues'</a>.) </p><p>Women with a history of sensitive skin or exfoliative dermatologic disorders may not be ideal candidates for using the patch.</p><p>Women with skin hypersensitivity to any component of the transdermal system should not use this system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Obese women should be counseled about the potential for reduced contraceptive efficacy, although obesity is not a contraindication to use.

Hormonal contraception can be safely provided after obtaining a thorough medical history and a blood pressure measurement. While breast examinations and screening for sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer are important, most experts agree that these procedures are not necessary before a first prescription for hormonal contraceptives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89825\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89825 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Screening requirements'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The manufacturer recommends initiation of the patch on either the first day of menses (First Day Start) or the Sunday following the start of menses (Sunday Start) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, starting the patch at the time of the initial office visit (Quick Start) is reasonable and may reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], as long as pregnancy is reasonably excluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67567\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67567 \">table 3</a>). Patient preference should guide the method of initiation. If the patch is initiated more than five days from onset of menses, abstinence or back-up contraception (eg, condom, vaginal spermicide) should be used through the first seven days of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Postpartum and postabortion initiation of combined hormonal contraceptive methods are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Switching from one hormonal method to another and switching from intrauterine device (IUD) to patch use are also reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Insertion and removal&quot;, section on 'IUD removal (with or without replacement)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Administration'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Extended cycle use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patch may be administered for extended cycles (an &ldquo;off-label&quot; use), although we avoid this practice, given the controversy about thrombosis risk in patch users. In the only study evaluating extended use of the <span class=\"nowrap\">norelgestromin/ethinyl</span> estradiol system, 239 women were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to an extended or standard (cyclic) regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The extended regimen was a weekly application of the patch for 12 consecutive weeks, followed by 1 patch-free week. After the patch-free week, users completed three additional consecutive weekly applications.</p><p>Compared to cyclic use, the extended regimen group had significantly fewer median bleeding days (14 versus 6), fewer bleeding episodes (1 versus 3), and fewer bleeding or spotting episodes (3 versus 2). However, the median numbers of bleeding or spotting days were similar for both groups (16 versus 14). In the extended use group, there was a significantly delayed median time to first bleeding (54 versus 25 days) and higher amenorrhea rates (12 versus 1 percent). Both regimens were associated with high user satisfaction rates (88.6 versus 86.3 percent), although there were more reports of headache, nausea, and breast discomfort in the extended regimen group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Patch management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Applying and changing the patch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patch is applied to the buttock, abdomen, upper arm, or upper torso (but not the breast, as it might cause breast tenderness due to high local estrogen concentration). A different site is used each time a new patch is applied. Lotions and occlusive dressings should not be used at patch application sites.</p><p>The patch is changed once a week for three weeks (21 total days), followed by one week that is patch-free. It should always be <span class=\"nowrap\">changed/applied</span> on the same day of the week (eg, Sundays for Sunday start). Reminder systems are useful to ensure appropriate weekly changes. If a patient wants to switch to a new patch change day, the switch should be made during the last week of the cycle (ie, the patch-free week).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Delayed patch changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The consequences of failing to change the transdermal contraceptive patch at the appropriate time should be addressed with patients. The care provider should try various strategies to help users adhere to a schedule and thus avoid an unplanned pregnancy. For women with delays in initiating the patch, we take the following approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delay in beginning the first patch in a cycle</strong> &ndash; When a new patch cycle is delayed beyond the scheduled start day, users are instructed to apply a patch as soon as they remember and use back-up contraception (or avoid sex) for at least one week. The day they apply the new patch becomes the new patch change day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delay in beginning the second or third patch in a cycle</strong> &ndash; There is a two-day (48 hours) period of continued release of adequate contraceptive steroid levels when the patch is left on for two extra days. If users change the patch within this window, the patch change day remains the same and there is no need for back-up contraception.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After this two-day (48 hours) time period, failure to replace the second or third patch in a cycle increases the risk for contraceptive failure. Therefore, users will need to use back-up contraception (or avoid sex) for seven days and, in some instances, use emergency contraception, if this occurs. The day the patient remembers to apply the patch becomes the new change day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delay in removing the third patch in a cycle</strong> &ndash; Forgetting to remove the third patch on time carries less risk than forgetting to remove the first or second patch. The user is instructed to remove the patch when she remembers; the patch change day is not altered.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Detached patch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a patch becomes partially or completely detached for less than 24 hours, it should be reapplied at the same location (if it has not lost its stickiness: ancillary adhesives or tape should <strong>not</strong> be used), or replaced with a new patch immediately. If detachment lasts longer than 24 hours, a new patch should be applied, and this day of the week becomes the new patch change day. An additional method of contraception (eg, condoms, spermicides) should be used for the first seven days of this cycle or the patient should avoid sex.</p><p>In various trials, 1.8 percent of transdermal patches required replacement for complete detachment and 2.9 percent became partially detached [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Living in a warm, humid climate did not increase the risk of detachment. The quality of adherence was illustrated in a study in which 30 women were subjected to various conditions over several seven-day time periods during transdermal patch use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The conditions included normal activity, use of a sauna, immersion in a whirlpool bath, use of a treadmill followed by showering, cool water immersion, and a combination of these activities. Only one patch became detached during the 87 cycles that were evaluated, suggesting that skin adherence is not adversely affected by a vigorous, athletic lifestyle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">NONCONTRACEPTIVE BENEFITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are few data on potential noncontraceptive benefits of the transdermal contraceptive patch, users are likely to accrue the same benefits achieved by users of other types of estrogen-progestin contraceptives (eg, reductions in dysmenorrhea, iron deficiency anemia, and ovarian and endometrial cancer). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Noncontraceptive benefits'</a>.)</p><p>Since patch use avoids intestinal absorption and the first pass effect through the liver, the patch is unlikely to impair the efficacy of other drugs (eg, some anticonvulsants and antibiotics), and its own efficacy is not affected by administration of other drugs given concomitantly. Support for this theory was provided by a study that reported serum levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethinyl-estradiol-and-norelgestromin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethinyl estradiol-norelgestromin</a> were not affected when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> was administered to users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the manufacturer still warns that efficacy of the transdermal contraceptive patch may be affected by the use of some drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both oral and transdermal estrogen containing contraceptives appear to have adverse effects on coagulation factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], placing users at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Based on the evidence described below, there may be a modest increased risk of VTE for patch users compared with users of current combined oral contraceptives. In particular, diabetic women appear to be at increased risk of VTE with patch use. In a database study of over 36,000 women with either type 1 or 2 diabetes who were continuously prescribed contraceptives, the VTE rate for users of estrogen-progestin oral pills, vaginal rings, and patches, after controlling for other potential risk factors, was 10.3, 13.5, and 16.4 per 1000 women, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The increased VTE risk has been attributed to the observation that the average overall ethinyl estradiol (EE) concentration (&quot;area under the curve&quot;) in patch users is 60 percent higher than in women who use a 35-mcg EE pill; however, peak EE concentrations are 25 percent lower than in pill users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, the potential risk of VTE should be balanced against the benefits of this method for preventing pregnancy in women who may not be able to use other methods successfully and against the absolute risk of symptomatic VTE in <span class=\"nowrap\">pregnancy/postpartum,</span> which is about 200 events per 100,000 pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The baseline incidence of VTE in women of reproductive age has been estimated to be 50 to 100 per 100,000 woman years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Summary of data from epidemiological studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiological studies by several groups have evaluated the risk of VTE, myocardial infarction, and stroke in contraceptive patch users compared to women using a norgestimate-containing 35 mcg EE oral contraceptive. A background document prepared for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs concluded that &rdquo;none of the studies to date provides a definitive answer as to the safety of Ortho Evra with regard to thrombotic and thromboembolic events. The entire body of studies provides conflicting evidence that cannot be easily reconciled by considering any single difference among studies. Most of these studies have unique strengths and limitations, but the challenge lies in trying to reconcile multiple methodological differences between studies conducted in very different populations, often using different comparators and different exposure definitions&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The FDA Advisory Committee indicated that for most patients, the benefits (ie, pregnancy protection) outweigh the risks of VTE since some women may not be able to successfully use oral contraceptives. </p><p>It should be noted that VTE is a relatively rare event and has been reported as a potential risk of all hormonal contraceptive therapy.&nbsp;The absolute risk of death from pulmonary embolism in contraceptive users has been estimated to be 10.5 per million woman years (95% CI 6.2-16.6 per million woman years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14656600\"><span class=\"h3\">Boston collaborative drug surveillance program (BCDSP) data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jick and co-workers have published several studies using a variety of claims and databases to examine the risk of VTE among patch users compared with users of currently available oral contraceptives with varying results. Although two of their earlier studies showed no statistically significant increase in risk of VTE among patch users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], a more recent post-marketing study of 38 cases of VTE where the patch was compared to users of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> oral contraceptive containing 30 mcg of EE showed an OR of 2.41 (95% CI 1.17-4.97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. When the group combined these new cases with the cases from their previous studies, the risk fell to a non-significant level: OR 1.23 (95% CI 0.86-1.77) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A limitation of these studies is that ICD-9 coding was used to identify cases; there was no review of the medical records, which can reveal misclassification of subjects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14656607\"><span class=\"h3\">Data from other studies</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An epidemiological study by another group also used insurance claims information and had a similar study design, except it included medical record verification of study outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of VTE, myocardial infarction and stroke among users of the contraceptive patch compared with users of norgestimate-containing oral contraceptives with 35 mcg of EE. For VTE, there were 152 total cases; 606 controls were matched to the cases by year of birth and index date of the case.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The risk of VTE was significantly higher in current users of the patch compared with current users of the oral contraceptives, OR 2.2 (95% CI 1.2-4.0). The OR for stroke was 0.6 (95% CI 0.1-3.2), and for acute myocardial infarction was 1.2 (95% CI 0.3-4.7).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A FDA sponsored study utilized computerized data files from two integrated medical care programs and two state Medicaid programs to obtain data regarding the risk of several cardiovascular endpoints in combined hormonal contraceptives users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The authors identified 835,826 women who had at least one prescription filled for a combined hormonal contraceptive between 2001 and 2007. Outcomes evaluated included arterial thrombotic events ([ATE] myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke), VTE, cardiovascular disease mortality, and total mortality. The final cohort included 67,865 person-years of exposure to norelgestromin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In adjusted analyses of both current and new users, contraceptive patch use was associated with a significantly higher risk of VTE relative to low-estrogen comparators (RR 1.55; 95% CI 1.17-2.07), particularly after 12 months of use (RR 3.05, 95% CI 1.23-7.53). When the analysis was restricted to new users, however, there was no increased risk. Because the risk of VTE is higher among new users of any combined hormonal contraceptive, and there were likely more new users in the contraceptive patch group, the analysis combining current and new users probably underestimated the risk in the comparator group. To avoid this bias, comparisons should be made only among new users. In addition, although the authors attempted to adjust for some risk factors for VTE, they did not make adjustments for body mass index (BMI), family history of VTE, or smoking, which are significant risk factors for VTE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 15-year Danish historical cohort study evaluated data from national registries to determine the risk of arterial events, thrombotic stroke and myocardial infarction, in users of hormonal contraception compared with non-users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The cohort included the entire population of Danish women, 15 to 49 years of age, for the period 1995 through 2009. During 4748 person years of contraceptive patch use, two thrombotic strokes (incidence <span class=\"nowrap\">42/100,000</span> person years; adjusted RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.79-12.60) and no myocardial infarctions were observed. Among nonusers, the incidence of thrombotic stroke and myocardial infarction were 24.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/100,000</span> and 13.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/100,000</span> person years, respectively. Given that there were only 4748 person-years of observation for patch users with a wide confidence interval crossing 1.0, it is unclear whether the observed trend in stroke risk represents a real difference compared with nonusers. The risk was comparable to the risk with use of all other estrogen-progestin contraceptives. Therefore, although the risk of arterial events in patch users may be increased compared with women not using hormonal contraception, the absolute risk is likely very small, and probably would be acceptable to most women given the contraceptive and noncontraceptive benefits of hormonal contraception.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on coagulation factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other studies have attempted to determine whether the contraceptive patch and oral contraceptives have different effects on <span class=\"nowrap\">serum/plasma</span> markers of thrombosis. Two randomized trials found that both the contraceptive patch and various oral contraceptives produced similar prothrombotic changes in several putative markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], while one small trial reported that the contraceptive patch and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-vaginal-ring-ethinyl-estradiol-and-etonogestrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">contraceptive vaginal ring</a> produced more adverse changes on levels of protein C than did an oral contraceptive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>It should be noted that differences in the effects on prothrombotic markers do not necessarily predict differences in risk of clinical thrombotic events either in populations of women or in individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SIDE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the first two cycles of use, unscheduled bleeding is a common side effect. The pattern of breakthrough bleeding (bleeding requiring more than one pad or tampon daily) and spotting with the transdermal contraceptive patch is similar to that reported in oral contraceptive trials. As indicated in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64067 \">table 4</a>), by about six months, the frequency of such bleeding declines substantially and remains stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The most frequently reported side effects (other than unscheduled bleeding) in clinical trials of the transdermal patch were breast symptoms (22 percent), headache (21 percent), application site reactions (17 percent), nausea (17 percent), upper respiratory tract infection (10 percent), and dysmenorrhea (10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Fewer than 2 percent of women considered any of these side effects a reason to discontinue the method. For trials comparing the patch to an oral contraceptive, the frequency of these side effects was similar except that patch users had application site reactions, more breast symptoms (only during the first two cycles), and more dysmenorrhea. About 85 percent of women experiencing breast symptoms described them as mild to moderate; the frequency declined markedly with continued use of the method.</p><p>Weight gain and androgenic symptoms are <strong>not </strong>side effects. A placebo-controlled, randomized trial found no evidence that use of the patch affected body weight over nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Mean body weight increased from baseline by less than 2 lbs for both the contraceptive patch and placebo groups, with 80 percent of users in both groups within 5 percent of their starting weights by the end of nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Treatment with the patch increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) more than observed in pill users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but the reduction in androgen levels is comparable to that with oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In one study, the mean increase in SHBG from baseline after three cycles of treatment with the patch or pill was 449 and 274 percent, respectively; free testosterone fell 60 and 59 percent, respectively, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) fell 26 and 32 percent, respectively. Thus, the patch is likely to be useful in treatment of disorders associated with androgen excess (eg, acne, hirsutism). Of note, when lower doses of estrogen are administered transdermally (eg, postmenopausal hormone therapy), no significant increase in SHBG is observed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2061483\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE DIRECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two new contraceptive patches are currently being studied. One contains ethinyl estradiol (EE) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> (AG200-15). The daily delivery of estrogen by this patch is less than that delivered by the current patch and comparable to a 30-mcg EE pill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transdermal-contraceptive-patch/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. A progestin-only patch containing levonorgestrel (AG890) is also under development. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2405789442\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

However, the patch has the benefit of convenience of weekly administration, which generally appears to improve compliance. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The transdermal contraceptive system is a matrix system consisting of a thin 20 cm<sup>2</sup> square patch. The medicated layer contains 0.75 mg of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 6 mg of norelgestromin. Approximately 20 mcg of EE and 150 mcg norelgestromin are released daily. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Structure and pharmacology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patch is generally applied weekly for three consecutive weeks, followed by a patch-free week. It can be applied to the buttock, abdomen, upper arm, or upper torso (but not the breast, as it might cause breast tenderness due to high local estrogen concentration). A different site should be used each time a new patch is applied. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Patch management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a patch is not changed at the appropriate time, back-up contraception may be needed. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Delayed patch changes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a patch is detached for less than 24 hours, it can be reapplied at the same location or replaced with a new patch immediately. If detachment lasts longer than 24 hours, a new patch should be applied. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Detached patch'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a possibility of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patch users compared to users of combined oral contraceptives. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Risk of thrombotic events'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common side effects associated with patch use are unscheduled bleeding in the first few cycles, breast tenderness, and application site reactions. Most women do not discontinue the method because of side effects. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">US Food and Drug Administration.
