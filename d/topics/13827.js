Bone marrow is the tissue in the center of your bones that makes blood cells.</p><p>People with PV make too many red blood cells (the cells that carry oxygen to your body). They also have higher-than-normal levels of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White blood cells &ndash; These cells fight infections.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelets &ndash; Platelets help clots form so that you stop bleeding after you are injured.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71624333\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of PV?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with PV might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have headaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel weak or dizzy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweat a lot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel very itchy, especially when rubbing their skin after a warm bath or shower</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have painful, swollen joints, especially in the big toe, ankle, or knee (called &quot;gout&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have burning pain in the hands and feet, which can also turn red, white, or blue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have dangerous blood clots</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have vision problems, such as seeing dark spots, sparks, or flashes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have stomach problems, such as pain in the upper belly</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71624348\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for PV?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and order different blood tests. You might also need a bone marrow biopsy. For this test, a doctor takes a very small sample of your bone marrow. Then another doctor looks at the cells under a microscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71624363\"><span class=\"h1\">How is PV treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removing blood from your body (called &quot;phlebotomy&quot;) &ndash; This is similar to what happens if you give blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> &ndash; This helps prevent blood clots.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to keep your bone marrow from making too many red blood cells &ndash; These include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydroxyurea</a> (brand names: Droxia, Hydrea), interferon alfa (brand name: Intron A), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">busulfan</a> (brand name: Myleran, Busulfex).</p><p/><p>Your doctor might also prescribe medicines or other treatments to ease itching.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3588560179\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for PV involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have and when.</p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71624378\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=complete-blood-count-cbc-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Complete blood count (CBC) (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
