It results from incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct leading to the formation of a true diverticulum of the small intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Meckel's diverticula are uncommon and often clinically silent, particularly in the adult. Asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum may be discovered during abdominal exploration for the evaluation of unrelated pathology. Less commonly, they are found incidentally on diagnostic imaging. When symptomatic, Meckel's diverticulum may present with abdominal pain or symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding or bowel obstruction. </p><p>The embryology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of Meckel's diverticulum are reviewed here. The clinical evaluation of various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, bowel obstruction) in children and adults is found in separate topic reviews. General considerations for the management of other congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1124082254\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND EMBRYOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meckel's diverticulum is a true diverticulum, containing all layers of the small bowel wall. They arise from the antimesenteric surface of the middle-to-distal ileum. The diverticulum represents a persistent remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, which connects the midgut to the yolk sac in the fetus. The normal development of the intestine is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the development of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The omphalomesenteric duct normally involutes between the fifth and sixth weeks of human gestation as the bowel settles into its permanent position within the abdominal cavity. The persistence of the omphalomesenteric duct beyond fetal development may result in a variety of anatomic patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50824\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50824 \">figure 1</a>), including omphalomesenteric cysts, omphalomesenteric fistulae that drain through the umbilicus, and fibrous bands from the diverticulum to the umbilicus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F116606\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116606 \">picture 1</a>) that predispose to bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The most common form is a diverticulum without additional attachment, commonly referred to as Meckel's diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The rich blood supply to the diverticulum is provided by the vitelline artery, which is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63200\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63200 \">figure 2</a>). The embryological origin of the ectopic tissue within the walls of the diverticulum is not known; theories include a local erroneous association between neural crest and endodermal tissue and a missing restrictive mesodermal effect on the local endoderm within the diverticulum. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1124082232\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is probably no familial predisposition for Meckel's diverticulum, although a few cases of occurrence within the same family have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevalence of Meckel's diverticulum is increased in children born with major malformation of the umbilicus, alimentary tract, nervous system, or cardiovascular system, in descending order [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of Meckel's diverticulum depends upon the population studied. The subset of surgical patients undergoing abdominal exploration or diverticulectomy is the most studied population. In a study of 7927 patients (all ages) who underwent appendectomy, Meckel's diverticulum was present in 3 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the general population, the prevalence of Meckel's diverticulum has been estimated to be approximately 2 percent, although a systematic review found a prevalence of 1.2 percent among 31,499 autopsies in seven studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. </p><p>The rule of twos is the classic description of the essential features of Meckel's diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. It states that Meckel's occurs in approximately 2 percent of the population with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1, is located within two feet from the ileocecal valve, and can be two inches in length, although, in practice, the size of a Meckel's diverticulum can vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/4,5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,8</a>]. Approximately 2 to 4 percent of patients develop a complication over the course of their lives, typically before the age of two. A Meckel's diverticulum that bleeds is usually lined by two different types of mucosa: the native intestinal mucosa and a heterotopic mucosa. The most common type of heterotropic mucosa is gastric; pancreatic or colonic heterotropic mucosa have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956506821\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of Meckel's diverticulum has been difficult to define. It is thought that the incidence of symptoms from a Meckel's diverticulum decreases with age in the adult patient, although data on this pattern are not conclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Many studies have attempted to assess the incidence of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum, but since there is no simple screening technique to identify Meckel's diverticulum in the general population, population estimates have been used. For adult patients, one study analyzed the incidence of complications from Meckel's diverticulum over a 42-year period in a rural midwest county in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Using 2 percent as an estimate of the prevalence of Meckel's diverticulum in the general population, the authors estimated a 6.4 percent cumulative incidence of needing surgery to treat complications of Meckel's diverticulum up to 80 years of age. In this study, there was a higher incidence of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum in the adult male (124 per 100,000 person-years) compared with the adult female (50 per 100,000 person-years). An older population-based study performed over a 15-year period from a single county in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States estimated a 4.2 percent incidence of symptoms over a lifetime due to Meckel's diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4148686\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for developing symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meckel's diverticulum can cause symptoms or can remain clinically silent. Asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is occasionally identified incidentally on imaging but is more commonly diagnosed during abdominal exploration for an unrelated pathology. (See <a href=\"#H3151259\" class=\"local\">'Incidental Meckel's diverticulum'</a> below and <a href=\"#H956511316\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinical features associated with an increased risk of developing symptoms from a Meckel's diverticulum identified on logistic regression in a study of 1476 patients followed over 50 years at a single institution included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &lt;50 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% CI 2.6-4.8) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male sex (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.4)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diverticulum length greater than 2 cm (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.4)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of histologically abnormal tissue (OR 13.9, 95% CI 9.9-19.6) </p><p/><p>The proportion with symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum when only one criterion was met was 17 percent. When two, three, or four of the first of these criteria were met, the proportion increased to 25, 42, and 70 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although the presence of histologically abnormal tissue is the most important of these factors, whether to obtain an imaging study (ie, Meckel's scan) to identify heterotopic tissue is controversial, since prophylactic removal of Meckel's diverticulum found on imaging alone is generally not supported by the available evidence. (See <a href=\"#H3151929\" class=\"local\">'Meckel's scan'</a> below and <a href=\"#H956511316\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1124082204\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3156232\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meckel's diverticulum is usually clinically silent but can be found incidentally or can present with a variety of clinical manifestations including gastrointestinal bleeding or other acute abdominal complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/1,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11-13</a>]. Between 25 and 50 percent of patients with symptoms present under 10 years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87458\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87458 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/6,10,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,11,14</a>]. Meckel's diverticula that contain ectopic gastric mucosa are generally associated with bleeding. Those that do not may remain silent or present with nonhemorrhagic symptoms such as bowel obstruction or diverticular inflammation (ie, Meckel's diverticulitis) or perforation. The clinical manifestations and initial approach to the patient with gastrointestinal bleeding or intestinal obstruction are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-small-bowel-bleeding-formerly-obscure-gastrointestinal-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding (formerly obscure gastrointestinal bleeding)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower gastrointestinal bleeding in children: Causes and diagnostic approach&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many of the case series documenting the clinical presentation of Meckel's diverticulum include both pediatric and adult patients, and it is difficult to define any true difference in presenting symptoms between age groups. It is generally thought that children present more often than adults with bleeding, and adults more often than children with symptoms of small bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/1,4,12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,12,15</a>]. It should be noted that the available data are not conclusive on this point, and some large case series suggest the opposite with respect to presenting symptoms in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. Thus, all varieties of symptomatic presentation should be considered in any age group. </p><p>Most patients who come to clinical attention have symptoms; however, Meckel's diverticulum is often not the first diagnosis considered in the differential diagnosis for many abdominal complaints. The clinical features (symptoms, laboratory, exam, imaging) of the patients with Meckel's diverticulum are nonspecific, but the age of the patient, along with clues from the clinical history or abdominal imaging during the evaluation of the primary complaint, may suggest the possibility of a Meckel's diverticulum. </p><p>Meckel's diverticulum should be suspected in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with painless lower gastrointestinal bleeding (see <a href=\"#H956507021\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal bleeding'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with intussusception, particularly recurrent or atypical intussusception (see <a href=\"#H956507031\" class=\"local\">'Intestinal obstruction'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with features of acute appendicitis, particularly when the appendix has already been removed (see <a href=\"#H956507192\" class=\"local\">'Acute abdominal pain'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults with gastrointestinal bleeding but no source identified with upper endoscopy or colonoscopy (see <a href=\"#H956507021\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal bleeding'</a> below)</p><p/><p>A definitive diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum is generally made in one of three ways depending upon the initial clinical presentation: a Meckel's scan, mesenteric arteriography, or abdominal exploration. The clinical features and diagnosis associated with the typical clinical presentations are discussed separately below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3151259\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidental Meckel's diverticulum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Meckel's diverticulum is occasionally identified incidentally on imaging studies. Features that may suggest a Meckel's diverticulum on routine abdominal imaging studies are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87461 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>]. When an asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is identified on imaging studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86622\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86622 \">image 1</a>), there are no data supporting a role for obtaining a Meckel's scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4148540\" class=\"local\">'Incidental Meckel's on imaging studies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H956511316\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum'</a> below.)</p><p>Asymptomatic Meckel's diverticula, however, are rarely identified by routine imaging studies. In one study, none of 26 asymptomatic patients had their Meckel's diverticulum identified prospectively on computed tomography (CT) imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Meckel's diverticulum is more likely to be discovered incidentally during abdominal exploration performed for another purpose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F116607\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116607 \">picture 2</a>). The decision as to whether to remove asymptomatic, incidentally discovered Meckel's diverticulum is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H4148533\" class=\"local\">'Normal Meckel's found during abdominal exploration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956507021\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal bleeding related to Meckel's diverticulum is caused by ulceration of the small bowel due to acid secretion by ectopic gastric mucosa within the diverticulum. The site of mucosal ulceration and bleeding is adjacent to or just downstream from the diverticulum, not from the mucosa or ectopic tissue within the diverticulum. </p><p>Case series have found that 12 to 21 percent of patients with Meckel's diverticula have ectopic tissue within the diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/5,11,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11,24,25</a>]. Gastric heterotopia is more common in patients with symptomatic versus asymptomatic Meckel's diverticula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/6,11,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,26</a>]. In a systematic review, 43 percent of symptomatic patients compared with 12 percent of asymptomatic patients had heterotopic tissue contained within the Meckel's diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although the most common ectopic tissue is gastric in origin, pancreatic and duodenal mucosa has also been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Due to the association of gastric heterotopia and gastrointestinal bleeding in the Meckel's patient, a Meckel's scan is more likely to be positive in patients who present with bleeding compared with those who present with other nonspecific symptoms (26 versus 2 percent, in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92598289\"><span class=\"h3\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding from Meckel's diverticulum may be chronic and insidious or acute and massive. Although the incidence of each type of bleeding is poorly reported in the literature, transfusions are uncommonly reported for Meckel's-associated bleeding. Children often present with dark red or maroon stools, while adults typically present with melena, which may be attributable to slower colonic transit time in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The abdominal examination is typically benign in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. </p><p>Laboratory studies obtained in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding may be consistent with volume depletion or anemia but do not help distinguish Meckel's diverticulum from any other source of gastrointestinal bleeding. Similarly, plain abdominal radiography in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding is nonspecific (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87461 \">table 1</a>). Bleeding diverticula cannot be routinely seen with standard CT. </p><p>Adult and pediatric patients with gastrointestinal bleeding are initially evaluated using standard algorithms. Patients who present with gastrointestinal bleeding may undergo routine upper or lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, neither of which can demonstrate a Meckel's diverticulum. However, Meckel's diverticulum has been identified using advanced endoscopy techniques (double balloon enteroscopy, capsule endoscopy), but these studies are not routinely obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

Active contrast extravasation may be seen in patients with ongoing hemorrhage.</p><p>In patients with less brisk bleeding, high-resolution CT angiography is increasingly being used.

However, CT angiography subjects the patient to ionizing radiation and requires intravenous contrast, which may be less desirable in certain patient populations (eg, children, pregnant women, renal dysfunction, contrast allergy).

Also, a broad-based, short diverticulum (one with a height-to-diameter ratio of less than 2.0) with features warranting resection is best addressed by a formal small bowel resection rather than a simple diverticulectomy due to the risk of leaving behind ectopic tissue at the base [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. </p><p>When gastrointestinal bleeding is the primary clinical manifestation, it is likely that both segmental small bowel resection and simple diverticulectomy are effective surgical approaches. Segmental resection removes the gastric mucosa within the diverticulum as well as the mucosal ulceration located in the adjacent small bowel. There are no definitive data demonstrating superiority of segmental resection over diverticulectomy. Diverticulectomy alone has been used in the setting of bleeding and appears to be safe with a low incidence of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/15,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956511316\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum may rarely be identified on imaging, but more commonly an asymptomatic, normal Meckel's diverticulum is found during the course of abdominal exploration (open or laparoscopic).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4148540\"><span class=\"h3\">Incidental Meckel's on imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with Meckel's diverticulum discovered incidentally on imaging, we suggest <strong>not</strong> performing elective resection.

The lifetime risk of developing complications related to Meckel's diverticulum is overall low (4 to 6 percent). A large number of elective Meckel's resections would need to be performed to prevent a single death related to complications from a Meckel's diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. In one study, to prevent one death would require removing approximately 800 asymptomatic Meckel's diverticula, unnecessarily exposing these patients to the risk of surgical complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Although this issue has been evaluated in multiple case series and systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/1,5,8,11,15,27,66,68-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,8,11,15,27,66,68-72</a>], there are no definitive prospective data supporting resection over no resection. Since most published studies combine adult and pediatric populations, it is difficult to define an appropriate algorithm for resection based solely upon age. Comparisons are further complicated by the varying definition of &quot;child&quot; used by various authors. Some authors suggest leaving incidentally detected Meckel's in situ regardless of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/5,8,69,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,69,81</a>]. Others advocate resection of all incidentally detected Meckel's diverticulum because gastric heterotopia in the resected Meckel's specimen is a common finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/10,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,67,68</a>]. </p><p>When asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is identified during abdominal exploration, we do not routinely resect all Meckel's diverticula; rather, we take into consideration the patient's clinical status, <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> lifelong risk of Meckel's-related complications, and anatomic features associated with developing symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/11,71,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,71,73</a>]. A risk score has been used by some to guide decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4148686\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for developing symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p>We suggest a selective approach resecting the Meckel's diverticulum in otherwise healthy, young adults (&lt;50 years of age) with anatomic risk factors (length &gt;2 cm, palpable abnormality, fibrous bands) associated with Meckel's complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/11,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,73</a>]. Patients without these features should not undergo Meckel's resection. Older patients (&gt;50 years) and those with medical comorbidities should <strong>not</strong> undergo resection of incidental Meckel's, unless there is a palpable abnormality. This selective approach is further supported by a systematic review that compared complication rates of patients with resected asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum with those who did not undergo resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Mortality associated with Meckel's resection was overall low, but, among those who died, 94 percent were older than 44 years of age. The incidence of perioperative complications was significantly higher in those who underwent resection of the Meckel's compared with those who did not (5.3 versus 1.3 percent). In four studies, 91 patients were followed for a variable period of time after an incidental Meckel's diverticulum was left in situ; no patient developed clinical manifestations. </p><p>The risk of complications of Meckel's diverticulum may be higher for children compared with adults. In a review of 74 children, the risk of Meckel's-related complications in children under two years and between two and eight years of age was significantly higher compared with children older than eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Thus, some authors have suggested removal of all asymptomatic diverticula in children younger than eight years of age. Our practice is to resect Meckel's diverticulum incidentally identified on abdominal exploration in most children. The Meckel's diverticulum can remain in place for selected children with medical comorbidities provided risk factors associated with complications of Meckel's diverticulum are not present.

However, the incidence of complications is difficult to estimate in patients who have undergone resection for incidental, asymptomatic diverticula during the course of another procedure. Population-based studies have estimated a 2 to 20 percent complication rate from resection of an asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum, but few of these complications (apart from rare anastomotic leaks) could be directly attributed to resection of the diverticulum. In a systematic review, the perioperative morbidity was 12 percent for resection of symptomatic Meckel's, and the cumulative risk of long-term postoperative complications was 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meckels-diverticulum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Meckel's diverticulum is a true diverticulum that arises from the antimesenteric surface of the mid-to-distal ileum that results from incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct. (See <a href=\"#H20956569\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1124082254\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and embryology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rule of twos is the classic description of the essential features of Meckel's diverticulum. Meckel's diverticulum occurs in approximately 2 percent of the population with a male to female ratio of 2:1, is found approximately two feet from the ileocecal valve, and is approximately two inches long. Approximately 2 percent of patients develop a complication over their lifetime, typically before the age of two. Symptomatic Meckel's diverticula most often contain both native intestinal and heterotropic gastric mucosa. There is no familial predisposition for Meckel's diverticulum, but the prevalence is increased in children with major malformations of the umbilicus, alimentary tract, nervous system, or cardiovascular system. (See <a href=\"#H1124082232\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meckel's diverticulum is often clinically silent, particularly in the adult. Incidental Meckel's diverticulum is most commonly identified during abdominal exploration for an unrelated pathology. When symptomatic, Meckel's diverticulum can present with gastrointestinal bleeding or acute abdominal pain related to bowel obstruction, Meckel's diverticulitis, or perforation. Between 25 and 50 percent of symptomatic patients present at less than 10 years of age. Specific anatomic factors related to the Meckel's diverticulum (length &gt;2 cm, palpable abnormality) increase the risk of developing symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H1124082204\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4148686\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for developing symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meckel's diverticulum is often not the first diagnosis considered for many abdominal complaints. A diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum should be suspected in patients with the following clinical features:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children with painless lower gastrointestinal bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children and adults with intussusception, particularly children with recurrent small bowel intussusception</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with features of appendicitis, particularly when the appendix has already been removed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adults with gastrointestinal bleeding but negative upper endoscopy and colonoscopy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain features on routine imaging studies (eg, plain abdominal films, ultrasound, computed tomography) obtained to evaluate abdominal pain or intestinal obstruction may suggest a diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum, but these findings are usually nonspecific. In patients without immediate indications for abdominal exploration (eg, perforation), a suspicion for a bleeding Meckel's diverticulum can be investigated with a Meckel's scan, which identifies the presence of ectopic gastric mucosa within the diverticulum. A Meckel's scan should be obtained earlier in the evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding in children compared with adults. Meckel's diverticula without ectopic gastric mucosa will not be visible on a Meckel's scan. Abdominal exploration will be needed to establish the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum includes any etiology that can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, small bowel obstruction, or acute abdominal pain. There are no specific clinical features that reliably distinguish symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum from other causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58363\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58363 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58308\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58308 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F104990\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104990 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53183\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53183 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67102\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67102 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60310 \">table 6</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum should be resected in all patients (children and adults) to relieve symptoms.

For children and adults with asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum identified on imaging studies, we suggest <strong>not</strong> performing elective resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients with a normal-appearing Meckel's diverticulum identified on abdominal exploration, we use a selective approach that takes into consideration the patient's clinical status, <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> lifelong risk of Meckel's-related complications, and anatomic features associated with developing symptoms.
