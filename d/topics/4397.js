The incidence of diving-related disorders has increased in tandem with this increasing population at risk. The Divers Alert Network (<a href=\"http://www.diversalertnetwork.org/&amp;token=N8gcqLWNb2WOLuK1uRUuibzwCUN4Yz0kaKQCrSWSkscEE2S9sc7IytNoPZ/paLQM&amp;TOPIC_ID=177\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.diversalertnetwork.org</a>) records more than 1000 diving-related injuries annually, of which almost 10 percent are fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hypothermia, trauma, and submersion-related injuries are potential complications of diving.

This law helps to explain the principles behind diving-related barotrauma and air embolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Henry's law</strong> states that at a constant temperature, the amount of a gas that is dissolved in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas. This law provides the explanation for decompression sickness and nitrogen narcosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BAROTRAUMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Barotrauma is the most common form of diving-related injury and develops when an air-filled body space fails to equilibrate its pressure with the environment following changes in ambient pressure. Barotrauma can occur due to under-pressurization (during descent) or over-pressurization (during ascent), with the latter generally causing more severe sequelae. During descent, decreasing air volume in a space that also contains tissue leads to mucosal edema, vascular engorgement, and hemorrhage. During ascent, increasing gas volume in a confined space can produce tissue disruption and rupture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary barotrauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following drowning, pulmonary barotrauma is the second leading cause of death among scuba divers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As a diver descends, the air in the lungs becomes compressed. Pulmonary edema and hemorrhage occur when lung volume decreases below residual volume. As a diver ascends and transalveolar pressure exceeds 20 to 80 mmHg, overexpansion injury in the form of alveolar rupture can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Divers who hold their breath as they ascend and those with obstructive airway diseases, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are at increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumomediastinum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following alveolar rupture, gas can dissect along the perivascular sheath into the mediastinum to produce pneumomediastinum. Symptoms of pneumomediastinum include a sensation of fullness in the chest, pleuritic chest pain that may radiate to the shoulders, dyspnea, coughing, hoarseness, and dysphagia. Crepitation in the neck due to associated subcutaneous emphysema may be present, and a crackling sound heard over the heart during systole (Hamman's sign) may be appreciated upon auscultation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67176\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67176 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The diagnosis can be confirmed on the basis of chest and neck radiographs. Typically, a radiolucent band is seen along the cardiac border on the posteroanterior film and retrosternally on the lateral view. No specific treatment is required, but inhalation of 100 percent oxygen is recommended to hasten resorption of extraalveolar gas. Rarely, mediastinotomy may be required to relieve a tension pneumomediastinum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumothorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumothorax is relatively uncommon, developing in only approximately 10 percent of episodes of pulmonary barotrauma. Patients with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax, bullae, or cystic lung disease are at increased risk of pneumothorax and should be cautioned against diving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Pneumothorax develops when gas ruptures from the lung parenchyma into the pleural space. If this occurs at a significant depth, the pleural gas expands as the diver ascends (as described by Boyle's law) and can result in a tension pneumothorax. Manifestations include dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia, hypotension, cyanosis, distended neck veins, tracheal deviation, hyperresonance to percussion, unilateral decrease in breath sounds, and accompanying subcutaneous emphysema in approximately 25 percent of cases.</p><p>If a pneumothorax results in severe hypoxemia or hemodynamic compromise, immediate pleural decompression is required. This is usually accomplished by inserting a large-bore needle into the second intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line of the affected hemithorax, followed by tube thoracostomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Arterial gas embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial gas embolism is the most serious potential sequel of pulmonary barotrauma. Arterial gas emboli can result from any of three processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passage of gas bubbles into the pulmonary veins and from there into the systemic circulation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of venous gas emboli (either from barotrauma or decompression sickness), which overwhelm the filtering capacity of the pulmonary capillaries to appear in the systemic arterial circulation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of venous gas emboli that reach the arterial circulation &quot;paradoxically&quot; via a functional right-to-left shunt, such as a patent foramen ovale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p/><p>After reaching the systemic arterial circulation, gas emboli typically break up as they reach vascular branch points and ultimately lodge in vessels with diameters ranging from 30 to 60 &micro;m, where they produce distal ischemia and local activation of inflammatory cascades. The specific symptoms and signs produced are dependent upon the final location of gas emboli; the most serious clinical consequences occur with embolization to the cerebral and coronary arteries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=air-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Air embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As little as 0.5 mL of air in the coronary circulation can lead to dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manifestations of cerebral emboli range from focal motor, sensory, or visual deficits to seizures, loss of consciousness, apnea, and death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucocutaneous findings include a characteristic cyanotic marbling of the skin and focal pallor of the tongue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embolization to the kidney can produce hematuria, proteinuria, and renal failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine and gastrointestinal bleeding and failure of other organs have occasionally been reported.</p><p/><p>Emergency treatment of arterial gas embolism includes the immediate administration of 100 percent oxygen to widen the pressure gradient for nitrogen between the bubble and the circulation and thus accelerate reabsorption of gas bubbles, and hydration to decrease vascular obstruction and augment collateral flow. The Trendelenburg position decreases the risk of additional cerebral emboli, but may increase cerebral edema; thus, the supine position is the best compromise for transportation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Patients should be transferred to the nearest hyperbaric oxygen facility as soon as possible, the location of which can be obtained from the Divers Alert Network at (919) 684-9111. The prognosis is generally improved with early treatment of cerebral air emboli, with a sharp decrease in clinical efficacy after a four to five hour delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Patients with residual deficits should receive repetitive, intermittent hyperbaric treatments and may require several days to reach maximum improvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperbaric oxygen therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adjunctive treatment with glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, or a combination of prostacyclin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>, and heparin has been reported, but the efficacy of these interventions is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Based on the available data, we do not recommend any of these adjunctive forms of therapy at the present time.</p><p>Some patients suffer neurologic deterioration after seemingly successful recompression treatment. This phenomenon may be due to the slow reexpansion of residual gas bubbles upon termination of hyperbaric therapy, postischemic reperfusion injury, or re-embolization from the underlying area of pulmonary abnormality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Ear barotrauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involvement of the middle ear during descent (&quot;ear squeeze&quot;) is the most common disorder among divers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/3,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20</a>]. Pressure in the middle ear normally equilibrates with ambient pressure via the eustachian tube. However, if upon descent this equalization is prevented by mucosal edema secondary to an upper respiratory infection, pregnancy, or anatomic variations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], the negative pressure in the middle ear can lead to its filling with serous fluid or blood or to inward rupture of the tympanic membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-barotrauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ear barotrauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms vary from a sensation of pressure to hearing loss and pain, which may suddenly be relieved with rupture of the tympanic membrane. Acute unilateral tympanic membrane rupture can also produce vertigo, nausea, and disorientation due to leakage of cold water into the middle ear and uneven caloric stimulation. Over-pressurization of the middle ear can occur during ascent, but tympanic membrane rupture is rare.</p><p>Divers should attempt to prevent ear barotrauma by the use of maneuvers that open the Eustachian tubes and equalize pressure between the middle ear and the ambient environment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61166 \">table 1</a>). Treatment of middle ear barotrauma consists of topical and systemic decongestants, analgesics, and antihistamines. Antibiotics should be used if purulent otorrhea is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Most tympanic membrane ruptures heal spontaneously if normal eustachian tube function is restored and infection is controlled.</p><p>Inner ear barotrauma is a fairly uncommon injury but should be excluded in all cases of middle ear barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It can occur following the development of a sudden pressure differential between the inner and middle ear, leading to rupture of the round or oval window [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The main symptoms are tinnitus, vertigo, and hearing loss, which in turn can cause disorientation and panic. The resulting labyrinthine fistula and leakage of perilymph can result in permanent inner ear damage. Long-term follow-up of a small cohort of divers who experienced inner ear barotrauma and inner ear decompression sickness treated with hyperbaric recompression noted that persistent vestibular deficits were common (though often asymptomatic) in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The primary treatment of this complication is complete bed rest with head elevation to avoid increases in cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which can increase the leakage of perilymph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>]. Deteriorating inner ear function generally requires tympanotomy and patching of the round or oval window [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Sinus barotrauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sinus barotrauma is the second most common disorder among divers, following ear barotrauma. During descent, increases in ambient environmental pressure can lead to mucosal engorgement, edema, and inflammation producing blockage of the sinus ostia; the frontal sinus is most commonly affected due to the relatively long and tortuous course of its duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Common symptoms include headache, epistaxis, and localized sinus pain. Treatment includes the use of topical and systemic decongestants and antibiotics if purulent nasal discharge is seen.</p><p>If a one-way valve blockage occurs at a sinus ostium, a sudden decrease in ambient pressure during ascent can lead to a pressure differential that may be sufficient to rupture the sinus and produce pneumocephalus. The treatment in such cases is careful observation and prophylactic antibiotics for meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Antibiotic coverage should be directed at nasopharyngeal flora and traditionally has included agents in the penicillin or cephalosporin classes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Dental barotrauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During ascent or descent, the volume of air spaces at the roots of infected teeth or adjacent to fillings can change rapidly, leading to toothache or breakdown of the tooth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Dental barotrauma is a common complication, reported in 66 of 709 (9 percent) of experienced divers in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. According to two reports, orofacial pain (including toothache, sinus, and jaw pain) occurs frequently in divers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/3,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decompression sickness was originally described as &quot;caisson disease&quot; when it was first recognized in 1843 among tunnel workers following return from the compressed environment of the caisson to atmospheric pressure. The term &quot;the bends&quot; is frequently applied to this illness because laborers with decompression sickness sometimes walked with a slight stoop, a posture affected by female socialites around the time of construction of the Brooklyn Bridge in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and also known as the Grecian Bend [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>As a diver descends and breathes air under increased pressure, the tissues become loaded with increased quantities of oxygen and nitrogen as predicted by Henry's law. As the diver returns to the surface, the sum of the gas tensions in the tissue may exceed the ambient pressure and lead to the liberation of free gas from the tissues in the form of bubbles; the location of bubble formation is somewhat dependent upon tissue characteristics. The liberated gas bubbles can alter organ function by blocking vessels, rupturing or compressing tissue, or activating clotting and inflammatory cascades. The volume and location of these bubbles determine if symptoms occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors can increase the risk of developing decompression sickness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Right-to-left shunt</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any intracardiac right-to-left shunt (eg, patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and partially corrected Tetralogy of Fallot) increases the risk of paradoxical air emboli, and is considered by many to be a contraindication to continued diving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/9,12,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,34</a>]. As an example, the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is associated with a two- to five-fold increase in the odds ratio for developing serious (Type II) decompression sickness, although the overall incidence of this complication is low (4 to 6 per 10,000 dives) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>]. Among patients with a patent foramen ovale, the risk is increased with larger PFOs and increased atrial septal mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that, during decompression, gaseous pulmonary emboli may increase right heart pressures, leading to right-to-left shunting and paradoxical arterial embolism. Support for this comes from a longitudinal study performed on divers with known PFO that noted progressive patency of these lesions over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This finding contrasts with the presumed natural history of PFO based upon autopsy studies that suggest decreased patency and gradual closure over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patent-foramen-ovale\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patent foramen ovale&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although shunting across a PFO is considered a contraindication to diving, closure of a PFO may be safe and allow some patients to return to diving. An audit of PFO closures among divers in the United Kingdom was associated with few complications and a return to unrestricted diving in 81 of 98 divers, with another 14 returning with restrictions on the depth of the dive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, PFOs are prevalent in the population and decompression sickness associated with recreational diving is uncommon. Thus, it may be that primarily those with larger PFOs or frequent divers with repeated decompression sickness should be considered for PFO closure with consultation by a cardiologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Air travel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who travel by air soon after scuba diving are at increased risk for developing decompression sickness (DCS) in-flight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Therefore, many experts suggest a waiting period before flying after diving, although research is limited and the optimal waiting period is not known. We concur and believe that a passenger should be advised to wait 12 hours before flying if he or she has been making only one dive per day. Individuals who have participated in multiple dives, or those requiring decompression stops, should consider waiting up to 48 hours before flying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of adult patients for air travel&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Gender</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men appear to be at greater risk of decompression sickness than women. However, this difference may be related to specific aspects of diving, including maximum depth, rate of descent and ascent, and number of dives undertaken per day, rather than gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inexperienced divers are at greater risk of decompression sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 75 percent of patients with decompression sickness develop symptoms within one hour and 90 percent within 12 hours of surfacing; only a small number become symptomatic more than 24 hours after diving. Scuba divers should wait 12 to 48 hours before flying on a commercial airliner, depending upon the length of their diving exposures, to avoid decompression sickness in a diver who has subclinical gas bubbles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Prodromal manifestations of decompression sickness include malaise, fatigue, and a sense of foreboding. Other constitutional symptoms include anorexia and headache. Decompression sickness is classified into two types based on the clinical manifestations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Type I decompression sickness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type I decompression sickness involves mild insults and typically affects the following organ systems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal &ndash; Localized joint pain is the most common manifestation of decompression sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Joints appear particularly vulnerable to the development of gas bubbles because local regions of negative pressure are created during the movement of lubricated articular surfaces. Symptoms are believed to result from the presence of bubbles in the periarticular tissues, which impair blood flow and stretch noncompliant tissues. Pain generally develops within an hour of surfacing and gradually increases over the next one to two days. The elbow and shoulder are affected three times more commonly than the knee and hip. Motion of the joint usually does not worsen the pain, and localized tenderness or signs of inflammation are rarely seen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous &ndash; Pruritus, usually over the upper torso, is relatively common and thought to result from the presence of small bubbles in the skin. It generally resolves within 30 minutes, even without treatment. Localized erythema, potentially evolving into mottled areas of cyanosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], can also be seen. It likely is due to vasospasm or obstruction of venous drainage by the bubbles and resolves without treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphatic &ndash; Lymphatic obstruction by bubbles, although rare, can lead to pain, lymphadenopathy, and localized edema, usually with follicular depressions and a peau d'orange effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. These lesions are mainly seen on the chest and torso.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Type II decompression sickness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type II decompression sickness is more severe and can lead to permanent injury and death. The following systems are typically affected:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic &ndash; Approximately 60 percent of divers with decompression sickness have signs and symptoms of nervous system involvement. The vast majority of these cases are characterized by damage to the spinal cord, usually in the upper lumbar or lower thoracic regions. Paresthesias and weakness may progress to paraplegia, and loss of sphincter control, particularly of the bladder, may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Cerebral manifestations can also occur and include memory loss, ataxia (&quot;the staggers&quot;), visual disturbances, and changes in personality, speech, and affect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Most of these manifestations are believed to result from the formation and coalescence of gas bubbles within low pressure venous plexi and consequent venous obstruction. However, microvascular arterial embolization or bubble formation within nervous tissue may also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary &ndash; In about 5 percent of cases of decompression sickness, the burden of venous air bubbles is sufficient to precipitate symptomatic venous gas embolism. Gas bubbles can occlude portions of the pulmonary circulation and produce chest pain, wheezing, dyspnea, and pharyngeal irritation (&quot;the chokes&quot;). Embarrassment of right ventricular outflow with acute right-sided cardiac failure (&quot;air lock&quot;), circulatory collapse, and death may ensue, or some gas bubbles may traverse the pulmonary capillary bed or a patent foramen ovale to produce arterial gas emboli. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=air-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Air embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of significant decompression sickness includes hydration, administration of 100 percent oxygen, and positioning the patient in the left lateral decubitus (Durant's maneuver) and mild Trendelenburg (bed angled downward toward head) position in an effort to restore forward blood flow by placing the right ventricular outflow tract inferior to the right ventricular cavity, permitting air to migrate superiorly to a nonobstructing position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Although randomized trials are lacking, definitive treatment includes hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber initiated as quickly as possible, since the time to initiation of treatment is one of the main determinants of outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy decreases the volume of air bubbles according to Boyle's law and also provides oxygenation to hypoxic tissue by increasing the dissolved oxygen content of arterial blood. In addition, plasma nitrogen concentration decreases, increasing the gradient of nitrogen from bubble to plasma, thus accelerating the absorption of bubbles. Hyperbaric therapy should be undertaken for at least four hours, since bubble elimination may be poor in areas of reduced flow where edema and sludging are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperbaric oxygen therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Complete resolution of symptoms in Type II decompression sickness is seen in almost 75 percent of cases, while approximately 16 percent of patients may have residual symptoms for up to three months. Delayed treatment has an adverse effect, with one study reporting a decrease in successful outcomes from 75 to 57 percent when treatment was delayed beyond 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, recompression treatment should never be withheld even after a long delay because favorable results can still occur in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].</p><p>Adverse effects due to hyperbaric therapy are relatively rare. A dry cough associated with carinal irritation and decrements in pulmonary function occur when divers undergo extended recompression therapy; these phenomena are due to hyperoxic bronchial injury and absorptive atelectasis, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Oxygen toxicity involving the central nervous system can lead to seizures, and older patients undergoing repeated treatments can develop myopia due to an alteration in the lens structure, which reverses in about six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As in the case of arterial gas embolism, several adjunctive therapies for decompression sickness have been utilized, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anticoagulants, and glucocorticoids, but none has been shown to improve outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. One randomized trial suggests NSAIDs may reduce the number of recompression treatments required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">NITROGEN NARCOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nitrogen narcosis is caused by the raised partial pressure of nitrogen in nervous system tissue, and usually occurs at depths greater than 100 feet. It has been called &quot;rapture of the depths&quot; because it induces signs and symptoms similar to alcohol or benzodiazepine intoxication, such as impairment of intellectual and neuromuscular performance and changes in behavior and personality. Hallucinations and loss of consciousness can occur at depths greater than 300 feet.</p><p>A diver's susceptibility to nitrogen narcosis is increased by other factors that have an opioid effect on the central nervous system, such as, hypercarbia, fatigue, alcohol, and hypothermia (core temperature less than 35&ordm;C) induced by cold water. Divers recover rapidly upon ascent to a shallower depth. The main danger of this condition stems from impairment of the diver's judgment, which can lead to drowning accidents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">DIVING AND COEXISTING CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiologic changes engendered by diving are generally well tolerated, but a number of medical conditions can increase the potential for complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The British Thoracic Society published guidelines for the respiratory evaluation of potential divers in 2003 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73880%7EEM%2F54026\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73880 graphicRef54026 \">table 2A-B</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The key points essential to clinical assessment before diving are outlined in an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74826\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74826 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy is not an absolute contraindication to diving, although all pregnant women should probably be discouraged from undertaking the sport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The fetus is not protected from decompression sickness and is at greater risk of malformations and arterial gas emboli due to the lack of an effective pulmonary capillary filter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. In addition, changes in blood flow during pregnancy and abnormal temperature regulation in the mother can increase the risk of decompression sickness, while congested mucous membranes can lead to sinus and ear barotrauma. However, termination of pregnancy is not recommended in women who have dived early in pregnancy, and normal infants have been born to women who continued diving throughout gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of chronic obstructive lung disease, lung bullae or cysts, cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis, or a history of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum due to any cause should be considered <strong>absolute contraindications</strong> to diving.</p><p>A patient with active asthma should also be strongly discouraged from diving even if they have normal pulmonary function tests, because individual lung units may have prolonged time constants, exhibit gas trapping, and rupture upon ascent. However, asthmatics at their baseline status with normal pulmonary function and easily controlled airway reactivity during exercise are probably at only a minimally increased risk of diving-related barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute coronary syndrome can occur in association with diving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. However, there is little evidence to guide decisions about which patients should be screened for ischemic heart disease (IHD). We believe that patients with active, untreated IHD should not dive. Screening recommendations among medical organizations vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Some (eg, Divers Alert Network, Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society) recommend exercise stress testing for all potential divers older than 40 years, while others (eg, South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society) reserve such testing for divers over 45 years or anyone with significant risk factors for coronary artery disease. Given the dearth of evidence, either approach is reasonable.</p><p>The presence of a patent foramen ovale increases the risk of both arterial gas embolization and decompression sickness. Patients with a known right-to-left intracardiac shunt should consult with a cardiologist knowledgeable about diving medicine. Closure of the PFO may enable some patients to return to diving. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial septal abnormalities (PFO, ASD, and ASA) and risk of cerebral emboli in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A patient with a history of significant ventricular arrhythmias or exercise-induced arrhythmias should undergo cardiac stress testing before being permitted to dive. Among patients with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), swimming or diving can induce potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias; this association is relatively specific for LQTS type 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>].

Decisions about the safety of diving must be individualized within the context of the individual's overall health (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74826\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74826 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-scuba-diving/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1940060\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recreational SCUBA diving continues to increase in popularity, and diving-related injuries have increased proportionally. Potential complications include hypothermia, trauma, and submersion-related injuries. Barotrauma, decompression sickness, and nitrogen narcosis are complications more specific to diving.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Barotrauma is the most common form of diving-related injury and develops when an air-filled body space fails to equilibrate its pressure with the environment. Barotrauma can manifest as lung injury (including pneumothorax), arterial gas embolism, and ear or sinus injury. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Barotrauma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decompression sickness occurs when a diver returns to the surface and gas tensions in the tissue exceed the ambient pressure, leading to the liberation of free gas from the tissues in the form of bubbles. The liberated gas bubbles can alter organ function by blocking blood vessels, rupturing or compressing tissue, or activating clotting and inflammatory cascades. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Decompression sickness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of significant decompression sickness includes hydration, administration of 100 percent oxygen, positioning the patient to improve forward blood flow, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
