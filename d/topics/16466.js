There are two main routes of administration: intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC). A third route is intramuscular (IM), although this is uncommonly used, except for hyperimmune globulins (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies immune globulin</a>). There are also three different methods of administering immune globulin subcutaneously: traditional, facilitated subcutaneous, and subcutaneous rapid-push.</p><p>The available preparations, dosing, administration, and adverse effects of SC and IM preparations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> will be reviewed here, particularly as used in antibody deficiency states.

However, when IV preparations became available, the IV route became preferred because of the larger volumes that could be administered. Subsequently, subcutaneous immune globulin (SCIG) dramatically gained popularity for routine replacement therapy in primary immunodeficiencies as clinicians became aware that SC administration was quicker and had fewer systemic adverse effects compared with IV administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>IM preparations are uncommonly used in the treatment of antibody deficiencies. However, intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IMIG) can be given in single doses for short-term prevention of specific infectious diseases (eg, hepatitis A) following exposure or travel to a country where these disorders are endemic. Some hyperimmune globulins are animal antitoxins and antisera, and certain monoclonal antibody preparations are injected IM as well.

It is given using a two-step delivery system. The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronidase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronidase</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> are supplied together as separate bottles containing 5 mL of recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) per 10 g (100 mL) of 10 percent IVIG. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) component of HyQvia is 10 percent Gammagard (Kiovig in Europe). The hyaluronidase is drawn up into a separate single syringe and infused alone by manual push from the syringe before the SCIG is given (combining the rHuPH20 vials is done if more than one set of the <span class=\"nowrap\">hyaluronidase/immune</span> globulin is prescribed for injection into a single site). Immune globulin administration should commence within 10 minutes following hyaluronidase infusion.</p><p>If multiple vials of hyaluronidase-facilitated subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (fSCIG) are needed to obtain the desired therapeutic dose, it is necessary to acclimate the patient and SC space to the increased fluid volumes. This is achieved by four infusions over seven weeks as recommended in the package insert and presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105753\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105753 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Injection of rHuPH20 immediately before the IgG temporarily breaks down tissue hyaluronan, which is then reconstituted over the next 24 to 48 hours. This significantly increases the dispersion space for absorption of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>. This allows much larger doses to be administered per infusion than with traditional SCIG. As a result, this product can be dosed every two to four weeks, rather than weekly. fSCIG therefore has some of the properties of both SCIG and IVIG administration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F104410\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104410 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100095343\"><span class=\"h4\">Potential adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The formation of non-neutralizing antibodies to rHuPH20 was noted in 13 out of 83 patients in the product's pivotal study.

Injections are painful, the amount that can be injected is limited, there is risk of local tissue injury (such as nerve damage), and there is a higher risk of reactions. It is also not possible, in practice, to attain serum IgG levels in the normal range using the IM route. Because IMIG is rarely used for chronic therapy, there have been no studies comparing the efficacy of IM administration with other routes for more than 20 years.</p><p>A small supply of 16 percent IMIG is available in the form of GammaSTAN <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59390\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59390 \">table 1</a>).

In addition, a randomized crossover trial compared the two forms of therapy in 40 patients with primary antibody deficiencies and found no significant difference in the number of infections reported between the two routes of administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

This approach will, after several months, result in steady-state immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels equivalent or higher than the levels achieved with a similar dose of IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A dose of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per week may be a good starting dose for most patients (adults and children).</p><p>The dosing for hyaluronidase-facilitated SCIG (fSCIG) is essentially the same as that of IVIG, as discussed below.

This is partly due to truncation of the peak IgG levels, which occurs just after IV dosing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F104410\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104410 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/4,28,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,28,37-39</a>].

More importantly, a variety of studies suggest that different patients require different serum IgG levels to prevent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Therefore, each patient's dosing regimen should be individualized to a level that keeps the patient relatively infection-free.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347337201\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin preparation, premedication, and needles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infusion sites include the lower abdomen, <span class=\"nowrap\">upper/outer</span> thighs, or backs of the arms. Infusion sites are prepared by wiping with alcohol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>. Extensive scrubbing or povidone-iodine are not required. Children may prefer application of a local anesthetic cream like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-and-prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine-prilocaine</a> (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) or cold spray to the needle site. Infusions into infected or inflamed skin should be avoided.</p><p>Premedication is usually not required with SCIG.</p><p>Butterfly, &quot;soft-set,&quot; or Neria button-type needles are commonly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Several manufacturers produce needles specially designed for SCIG use with the needle mounted perpendicular to the wings. Shorter needles may be needed for very lean patients and young children. Inadvertent intradermal infusion should be avoided, and patients with local site reactions may do better with longer needles. If butterfly needles are used, 23 to 25 gauge needles that are three-fourths of an inch (1.9 cm) in length, work well for most adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/27,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,47</a>]. For infants, 24 to 27 gauge butterflies, 4 to 6 mm in length, are appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The tip of the infusion needle should be inserted 1 to 1.5 cm into the SC tissue, usually perpendicular to the skin surface. Patients should be trained to make sure that the infusion needle is not in a blood vessel, as inadvertent IV administration of SCIG preparations could increase the risk of systemic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A two-step check for blood return in the infusion line is suggested. First, the patient pulls back on the syringe and checks for blood return. Next, the patient removes the syringe from the infusion set and waits for 15 seconds before starting the IVIG to assure that no blood appears in the tubing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/25,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,35</a>]. After an infusion, a simple elastic bandage can be placed over the infusion site.

Peak serum levels occur two to three days later (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F104410\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104410 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Therapeutic plasma levels are not attained as rapidly with SCIG compared with IVIG. Thus, patients newly starting SCIG can be given a single loading dose of IVIG and then switched within seven days to an SC product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. An alternative method is to give five SC doses, each equivalent to the planned weekly dose, on consecutive days during the first week of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This practice often facilitates <span class=\"nowrap\">education/training</span> of the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/parent</span> in the proper technique for SC infusion for home therapy. With loading by either method, steady-state is achieved within one week. Without loading, steady-state with weekly infusions is reached after about 12 to 24 weeks of therapy. Of note, if dose adjustments are made, the time to reach a new steady-state is similarly gradual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376019106\"><span class=\"h2\">Obese patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is unclear whether obese patients (body mass index or BMI &gt;30) should be dosed based on ideal or actual body weight. One study found that higher doses of SCIG were required to achieve AUCs equal to those they attained previously with IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], although this was not seen in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Another study of obese patients with either immunodeficiency or neurologic indications for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> suggested that BMI could not be used to reliably predict dose restriction, and the authors concluded that immune globulin should be dosed on clinical outcome rather than body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose and dosing frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With all <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> products, initial doses are based upon weight but should be rounded to the nearest full vial of drug to avoid wastage. Another approach to avoid wasting drug is to adjust the dose up or down slightly on alternate weeks (for traditional SCIG). As an example, if the drug is supplied in 10 mL vials, a patient requiring 45 mL per week could alternate between 40 mL one week and 50 mL the next week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Dosing for traditional SCIG and fSCIG are distinct:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H759046756\"><span class=\"h3\">Traditional SCIG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with IVIG, traditional SCIG is administered in smaller doses and given more frequently. An empiric starting dose for SCIG is 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per week, for both adults and children. SCIG can also be administered at a dose of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every two weeks (sometimes called biweekly) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/1,35,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,35,47</a>] or in doses less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> given more than once per week. However, while often used in Europe and the United States, these alternative schedules are not in the FDA-approved labeling for available products (except for biweekly administration of the 20 percent product, Hizentra).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376019064\"><span class=\"h4\">Pumps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients use battery- or spring-driven pumps to deliver their weekly dose of SCIG over about one to two hours. During the infusion, patients can ambulate and engage in usual, nonstrenuous activities.</p><p>Syringe driver pumps, such as the Freedom60, with 40 to 60 mL syringes are convenient. An example of a smaller battery-operated pump is the Crono range (Crono PID 20, 50, and 100), which is used for administering 10 to 100 mL infusions of the available SCIG products to adults and children.</p><p>Between 5 and 30 mL of traditional SCIG (without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronidase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronidase</a>) can be infused at a given site, depending upon the patient's body habitus, age, and previous experience with the product being used. Patients requiring larger volumes should generally infuse at multiple sites simultaneously. Individual tolerance of volume per site is variable. Some patients who are able to infuse higher volumes comfortably (some over 80 mL) may choose to do so to limit sites and needles. Tubing sets with two or more bifurcations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the use of multiple pumps simultaneously facilitates infusion into several sites. For most adults, infusions of 40 to 60 mL are conveniently given over approximately two hours by using two sites simultaneously. Patients who tolerate infusion rates of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> can try increasing to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> to reduce the infusion time. The maximum rate approved by the FDA is 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> given into several sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

This technique, called &quot;rapid-push,&quot; simplifies and shortens the infusion time. Up to 20 mL can be given at a single site, usually over a period of 3 to 20 minutes, as is comfortable to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/48,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,51</a>]. In comparison, a weekly infusion of SCIG given by pump takes about one to two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/48,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,51</a>]. Simplicity, cost savings of pumps, and speed are balanced against frequency of infusion and number of needles.</p><p>In one study of 104 patients, the rapid-push method was preferred by the majority of patients beginning SCIG therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Subjects were given information about administration with pumps versus rapid-push, and 71 percent chose rapid-push. Patients self-administered 3 to 20 mL, usually at one site, three times weekly, on average. One-third experienced local reactions, but these were considered &quot;mild-to-moderate&quot; and were easily tolerated. Only two patients later changed to pump delivery. Use of the rapid-push technique has grown significantly in health care settings where access to infusion pumps is limited. It is anticipated that prefilled syringes when they become available will further enhance the convenience of rapid-push.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347337384\"><span class=\"h4\">Equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid-push administration requires standard, disposable 10 or 20 mL syringes, and either butterfly needles or special SCIG needles (mostly used in the United States) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Peristaltic pumps are the same pumps used for IV infusions. However, they may need to be programmed to avoid the back pressure alarms that are designed to warn of extravasation during an IV infusion, since the pressure for fSCIG is higher than with an IV infusion (but lower than traditional SCIG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In addition, the presence of normal immunoglobulin levels protects the mother through pregnancy and the peripartum period and provides protective antibody for the newborn, which is especially important because adequate immunoglobulin G (IgG) production in the baby is not achieved until six months of age. Since most of the IgG present in the newborn is transferred transplacentally during the third trimester, preterm babies have very low IgG levels, putting them at increased risk of infection.

The most common minor adverse effects with SCIG are local swellings at the infusion site(s). Other minor adverse effects include headache, diarrhea, fever, fatigue, back pain, and nausea.</p><p>Although SCIG has distinct advantages over IVIG, it can still cause most of the potentially serious adverse effects that are associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, including thromboembolic complications, hemolytic anemia, aseptic meningitis, transfusion associated acute lung injury, and hypersensitivity reactions. However, these adverse effects occur less frequently with SCIG compared with IVIG. Adverse effects of IVIG are reviewed separately.

In a study of 32 patients self-infusing SCIG, the percentage of subjects with transient local swelling declined from 75 percent at week 1 to 25 percent at week 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If local reactions continue to occur after the first few infusions and are bothersome to the patient, adjustments in rate, site, volume per site, and needle size and depth may be helpful. It is sometimes recommended that patients rotate infusion sites, although it has also been argued that rotating sites does not allow the site to acquire &quot;tolerance&quot; to local reactions with time. No long-term adverse effects have been reported at sites used repeatedly. Rarely, local skin necrosis may occur, which is believed to be due to pressure on the cutaneous microvasculature. This complication may potentially be caused by too shallow a depth of administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

It is as effective as IVIG in preventing infections in patients with primary antibody deficiencies and causes fewer systemic reactions. It provides more consistent serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and can be infused by patients at home (with or without a pump), leading to improved quality of life.
