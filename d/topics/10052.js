However, comprehensive ongoing assessment to detect neurodevelopmental sequelae and early interventions services are costly and labor intensive and may not be warranted in all preterm survivors. As a result, a key management issue confronting clinicians who care for preterm survivors and their families is identifying infants who are at risk for subsequent significant neurodevelopmental disability and who may benefit from early intervention. This is particularly challenging as available screening tools are not precise enough for accurate prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome for individual patients.</p><p>This topic will discuss follow-up neurodevelopmental care of former preterm infants recognizing the challenge of accurate clinical prediction. The epidemiology and risk factors of neurodevelopmental impairment for preterm infants are discussed separately.

The available clinical tools to predict outcome include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuroimaging (cranial ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early childhood clinical assessment during the first two years of life consisting of neurologic examination and evaluation of cognitive and motor function, language and social development and behavior</p><p/><p>Although these tools are useful in assessing population-based or large birth cohorts, they may not be specific enough to be helpful in accurately predicting outcome for all individual survivors. Nevertheless, based on available evidence, our approach for monitoring neurodevelopmental status is based on a risk assessment for the individual patient using these tools. Risk factors for neurodevelopmental impairment based on observational data from large cohort and population studies include extreme prematurity (gestational age [GA] less than 28 weeks), multisystem congenital malformations, and a neonatal course that includes one or more of the following conditions: severe asphyxia, intrauterine growth retardation, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia or infarction, meningitis, seizures, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and poor growth (including head growth).

In particular, neuroimaging is able to identify preterm infants with significant brain injury, who are at-risk for neurodevelopmental impairment. However, data correlating with clinical outcome remain inadequate to use these modalities as the <strong>sole</strong> accurate predictor of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome for individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363536877\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cranial ultrasonography is the primary neuroimaging modality used to evaluate intracranial pathology in preterm infants and predict long-term outcome. It can reliably detect germinal matrix IVH, and periventricular leukomalacia. Abnormal ultrasound findings associated with an increased risk of cognitive delay <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychomotor delay include <span class=\"nowrap\">moderate/severe</span> ventriculomegaly, echolucency and echodensity, severe IVH (&ge;grade III), and periventricular hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=germinal-matrix-hemorrhage-and-intraventricular-hemorrhage-gmh-ivh-in-the-newborn-prevention-management-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Germinal matrix hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) in the newborn: Prevention, management, and complications&quot;</a>). Although patients with neonatal cranial ultrasound abnormalities compared with those with normal studies are more likely to have long-term neurodevelopmental outcome impairment, a significant number of patients with a <strong>normal</strong> ultrasound may still have cognitive and psychomotor delay.</p><p>This was illustrated in a prospective study of 1017 extremely preterm infants with a GA &lt;28 weeks that reported cognitive delay in 23 percent of those with normal neonatal ultrasounds and psychomotor delay in 26 percent with a normal study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this study, testing was performed at 24 months of corrected age using the 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.</p><p>It also remains uncertain whether low-grade (grade I or II) periventricular hemorrhage detected by cranial ultrasonography has an impact on the outcomes of extremely low GA infants due to conflicting data. A National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) multicenter longitudinal observation study of infants born less than 27 weeks failed to demonstrate any significant neurodevelopmental impact of low-grade periventricular hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, two population-based studies found no significant differences in cognitive or educational outcomes for infants with low-grade hemorrhage compared with those with normal ultrasound scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, both studies suggested an increased risk of cerebral palsy (CP) associated with grade II periventricular hemorrhage. In contrast, a single-center retrospective study reported individuals with isolated grade I and II IVH were at increased risk for neurodevelopmental impairment and <span class=\"nowrap\">cognitive/language</span> impairment at 20 months corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Ultrasonography is not as sensitive as MRI in detecting diffuse white matter abnormalities or cerebellar abnormalities in the posterior fossa, particularly during the first month of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, extremely preterm infants with normal ultrasounds at term equivalent are unlikely to have moderate or severe white matter or gray matter abnormalities on MRI performed at term age equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Ultrasound is considerably less expensive and more readily available for neuroimaging in preterm infants than MRI. As a result, it is the most commonly used neuroimaging modality for the detection of brain injury. But, as noted above, the lack of sensitivity in detecting all patients with ultrasound must be taken into account.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363537057\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2379580969\"><span class=\"h4\">MRI at term gestation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lack of sufficient precise MRI data limits the clinical usefulness of MRI at term gestation to accurately predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcome for the individual survivor. In addition, neonatal MRI is a costly and challenging procedure. As a result, we do NOT perform routine MRI to predict neurodevelopmental outcome for all former preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>] (see <a href=\"#H363543381\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> below). However, there are other centers that perform routine MRI at term for all preterm survivors.</p><p>Neonatal MRI studies have shown that the majority of very preterm infants have white matter abnormalities, which include increasing ventricular size, decreasing white matter volume, increasing intensity of white matter signal, and evidence of decreasing myelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In addition, there is evidence that these findings are useful in predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcome based on studies that have shown correlation between neurodevelopmental outcome and either normal or seriously abnormal MRI scans at term equivalent for study cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/11-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-18</a>]. However, only using MRI data is insufficient to predict neurodevelopmental outcome for individual patients.</p><p>The limitation of MRI alone to accurately predict neurodevelopmental outcome was illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 167 preterm infants (GA &le;30 weeks) who had MRI performed at the equivalent of term gestation and underwent a comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessment at two years of corrected age, moderate to severe white matter abnormalities on MRI were predictive of severe motor delay and CP at two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, 7 of 47 patients (15 percent) with <strong>no</strong> white matter abnormality had severe impairment and almost half of the 35 patients with moderate to severe abnormalities did not have any evidence of severe impairment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a subsequent report of 104 of the original cohort evaluated at four and six years of age, children with any white matter abnormality were more likely to have neurodevelopmental impairment, and those with moderate to severe abnormalities were at risk for the greatest degree of cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, similar to the findings at two years of age, there were a few children <strong>without</strong> white matter abnormalities who had poor neurocognitive outcome, and several children who had moderate to severe white matter abnormalities without impairment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an NICHD study of 480 extremely preterm infants (GA &lt;28 weeks), MRI obtained between 35 and 42 weeks postmenstrual age demonstrated increasing severity of white matter abnormalities and significant cerebellar lesions were independently associated with adverse outcome (death or neurodevelopmental impairment) at 18 to 22 months corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, 4 of 98 infants (4 percent) <strong>without</strong> any white matter abnormality had neurodevelopmental impairment, while 3 of 18 infants with severe MRI abnormalities were unimpaired or mildly impaired.</p><p/><p>These results demonstrate that abnormal MRI scans are predictive of poor neurodevelopmental outcome for a general cohort of patients. However, they also show MRI findings are <strong>inadequate</strong> to predict outcome for the<strong> individual</strong> infant because they are not precise enough for accurate prognostication in the clinical setting.</p><p>The cost and challenge of performing MRI in infants also limit the routine use of MRI. Infants need to be transported to the MRI suite and sedation is often required to minimize motion artifact, requiring personnel with expertise in neonatal transport and sedation. Accurate neonatal MRI readings require expertise by knowledgeable pediatric neuroradiologists. In particular, the ability to detect mild and moderate degrees of injury on MRI may need sophisticated scanning sequences as well as proficiency in the analysis of results. In the previously discussed NICHD study, MRI only marginally improved the information that was obtained by a combination of early (4 to 14 days of life) and late (term equivalent) cranial ultrasounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363542111\"><span class=\"h4\">MRI during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subsequent structural brain changes documented in former preterm infants at school age, adolescence and adulthood include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/19-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thinning of the corpus callosum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased ventricular volume</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased relative volume of gray and white matter during brain growth throughout childhood and adolescence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased total brain volume</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363543381\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do <strong>NOT</strong> routinely obtain MRI for all preterm infants because it is inadequate to accurately predict long-term outcome for the individual patient and it is a costly procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As noted above, there are other centers in which MRI is performed at term gestation in all preterm survivors.</p><p>In our practice, imaging is performed at term gestation equivalent <strong>ONLY</strong> for infants in the following clinical settings by an experienced and knowledgeable pediatric neuroradiology team:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up of abnormal cranial ultrasound results (eg, severe periventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and hydrocephalus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal neurologic examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected congenital or metabolic defect</p><p/><p>However, the use of neuroimaging <strong>alone</strong> is insufficient to determine long-term outcome and follow-up intervention for individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Clinicians need to remember that MRI results should be integrated with clinical information (physical examination findings, presence of other risk factors [eg, associated conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia], and neurocognitive testing) to assess the risk for developmental delay for each individual patient. At the present time, in our practice these data (although still suboptimal) are used to guide management regarding the intensity and duration of follow-up and the need for early intervention. (See <a href=\"#H363543685\" class=\"local\">'Approach for follow-up care'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H156814460\"><span class=\"h2\">Electroencephalography: Unproven tool</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is limited poor-quality evidence based on observational data that amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) or conventional EEG recorded within the first seven days of life may have potential as a predictor for subsequent neurodevelopmental outcome. However, a systematic review of the literature reported that the evidence based on a small number of studies is limited due to the high risk of bias and the wide variability in study design, including EEG criteria and outcome measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As a result, aEEG and EEG should <strong>not</strong> be used clinically and should be restricted as a research tool until there are high-quality studies that show that they are accurate predictors of neurodevelopmental outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363542892\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of clinical assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurodevelopmental outcome is assessed more accurately at school age than in early childhood because over time there is cognitive recovery as the brain continues to develop. Prediction of school age outcome improves as the age at the time of assessment increases. However, early assessment can identify preterm infants who have severe impairment that does not resolve by school age and who can benefit from early intervention.</p><p>This was best illustrated in a 10-year prospective study of 129 extremely low birth weight (ELBW, birth [BW] weight &le;1000 g) infants born between 1993 and 1998 who were evaluated at the equivalent of term gestation, and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months corrected age, with follow-up evaluation between 5 and 10 years of age (mean 8.5 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Assessment included neurologic examination, language and social development, behavior, and psychometric testing. The percentages of cases in which the neurodevelopmental status at school age was correctly predicted, were 49, 68, and 70 percent when the assessment was performed &quot;at term,&quot; and at two and four years of age, respectively. In contrast, patients with CP were accurately identified by two years of age.</p><p>Similarly, a prospective study of 296 premature infants (BW between 600 and 1250 g), who were serially evaluated at 36, 54, 72, and 96 months corrected age, showed improvement in verbal and IQ test scores over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of the literature that included studies in which at least two serial assessments, consisting of a developmental assessment between 1 and 3 years of age and a cognitive assessment at &ge;5 years of age, concluded that early developmental assessment had poor sensitivity (55 percent, 95% CI 46 to 64 percent) but good specificity (84 percent, 95% CI 78 to 89 percent) in predicting neurologic impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, 14 of the 24 studies only included participants born before 1990, and no participant was born since 2005.</p><p>Despite these concerns, early assessment can identify former preterm infants who have severe impairment that does not resolve by school age and who can benefit from early intervention. For example, in the EPICure study from Great Britain and Ireland of 308 former extremely preterm infants born in 1995, individuals with severe disability at 30 months of age continued to have moderate to severe disability at six years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In another study from Australia, adverse cognitive and academic outcomes persisted in adolescents born &lt;28 weeks gestation, particularly those with neonatal IVH and postnatal corticosteroid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In this cohort, biological factors associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcome were equal to or exceeded those of social factors.

However, eligibility for EIPs differs from state to state and not all NICU graduates will qualify in some states. Unfortunately, many children undergo their initial assessment for early intervention and are found to have a normal neurologic exam and are thus discharged from EIPs.

These sequelae include cognitive abnormalities, motor deficits including mild fine or gross motor delay, cerebral palsy (CP), and vision and hearing losses. The risk of impairment increases with decreasing gestational age (GA).

However, this is particularly challenging as available screening tools are not precise enough for accurate prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome for individual patients. In addition, the expense and skilled personnel needed to provide comprehensive follow-up care and the anxiety that this may provoke in parents may not be warranted in all preterm infants. (See <a href=\"#H363536467\" class=\"local\">'Challenges in predicting outcome'</a> above and <a href=\"#H363543685\" class=\"local\">'Approach for follow-up care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Although neuroimaging (cranial ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) can identify infants with significant brain injury who are at risk for neurodevelopmental impairment, data correlating with clinical outcome remain inadequate to use these modalities as the sole accurate predictor of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome for individuals. If neuroimaging is performed to assist in long-term neurodevelopmental prediction, we suggest that MRI be performed at term gestation. In our center, MRI is performed to follow-up on patients with abnormal cranial ultrasound results and those with an abnormal neurologic examination, or with congenital or metabolic defect(s).
