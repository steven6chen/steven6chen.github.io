Polyps are very common. Roughly one-third to one-half of all adults have them by the time they are 50 years old. They do not usually cause symptoms. But some polyps can be or become cancer, so doctors sometimes remove them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1472297213\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of colon polyps?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colon polyps do not usually cause symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1472297220\"><span class=\"h1\">How do doctors find colon polyps?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors usually find colon polyps when they are doing screening tests to check for colon or rectal cancer. Cancer screening tests are tests that are done to try and find cancer early, before a person has symptoms. The screening tests for colon and rectal cancer include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonoscopy &ndash; Before having a colonoscopy, you will get medicine to help you relax. Then a doctor will put a thin tube into your anus and advance it into your colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 2</a>). The tube has a camera attached to it, so the doctor can look inside your colon. The tube also has tools on the end, so the doctor can remove pieces of tissue, including polyps. After polyps are removed, they usually go to a lab to be tested for cancer and other problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sigmoidoscopy &ndash; A sigmoidoscopy is very similar to a colonoscopy. The only difference is that this test looks only at the first part of the colon, and a colonoscopy looks at the whole colon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT colonography (also known as virtual colonoscopy) &ndash; For a virtual colonoscopy, you have a special kind of X-ray taken, called a &quot;CT scan.&quot; This test creates pictures of the colon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stool test &ndash; &quot;Stool&quot; is another word for &quot;bowel movements.&quot; Stool tests check for blood or abnormal genes in samples of stool. If a stool test indicates that something might be wrong with the colon, doctors usually follow up with a colonoscopy. Then doctors find polyps, if they are there.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1472297227\"><span class=\"h1\">How are colon polyps treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors remove polyps using the same tools they use for a colonoscopy. They can remove polyps either by snipping them off with a special cutting tool, or by catching the polyps in a noose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63967\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63967 \">figure 3</a>). Most polyps can be removed during a colonoscopy. But sometimes, large polyps need to be removed at a later time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1472297234\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after I have polyps removed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might need to have a colonoscopy every few years to check for more polyps. In some people polyps come back. And if you had the kind of polyps that could become cancer, your doctor will want to remove them as they appear. Also, if the polyps you had removed were the kind that could become cancer, people in your family might need to be checked for polyps and colon cancer, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1472297241\"><span class=\"h1\">Can colon polyps be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To reduce your chances of getting polyps or colon cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a diet that is low in fat and high in fruits, vegetables, and fiber</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight, if you are overweight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not smoke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit the amount of alcohol you drink</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1472297248\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colonoscopy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-polyps-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colon polyps (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
