The most common medicines to treat ADHD are called &quot;stimulants.&quot; Stimulants do not cause children to be more active or excited. Instead, these medicines help different parts of the brain to work together.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81464130\"><span class=\"h1\">Does my child need medicines for ADHD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some parents wonder whether their child needs medicine for ADHD. It is something that all parents need to discuss with their child's doctor. But it's important to know that many studies show that ADHD medicines are very good at helping children to pay attention and concentrate better.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81464145\"><span class=\"h1\">Medicines to treat ADHD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are 2 main kinds of medicines to treat ADHD: stimulants and nonstimulants. Stimulants work faster and cost less than nonstimulants. But some children get side effect from stimulants, so they cannot take them. Plus, children with certain medical problems should not take stimulants. Your doctor or nurse will work with you to choose the safest medicine for your child.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Methylphenidate</a><strong> (sample brand names: Ritalin, Methylin)</strong> &ndash; These are stimulant medicines and are given as a tablet, capsule, or liquid. They come in different formulas that work on the body in different ways. Short-acting formulas are usually started with 1 dose per day. They later go up to 2 doses per day. Long-acting formulas are usually taken 1 time per day. A child can also get a methylphenidate patch (brand name: Daytrana). The child wears the patch on the skin for up to 9 hours per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Amphetamines (sample brand names: Dexedrine, Adderall,</strong> <strong>Vyvanse)</strong> &ndash; These are different types of stimulant medicines that also come in short-acting and long-acting formulas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atomoxetine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Atomoxetine</a><strong> (brand name: Strattera)</strong> &ndash; This is a non-stimulant medicine that a child can take if he or she should not take stimulants. Atomoxetine comes as a capsule that is usually taken 1 or 2 times per day.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81464162\"><span class=\"h1\">How soon will I notice a change in my child's behavior?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immediate-release stimulants usually start to work in 30 to 40 minutes. But doctors often start children on a low dose, which might be too small to make a difference in your child's behavior. Your child's nurse or doctor will tell you if you should give your child a higher dose.</p><p>If your child takes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atomoxetine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">atomoxetine</a>, it will probably take at least 1 week before you notice changes in your child's behavior.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81464177\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child needs to take ADHD medicine at school?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child needs to take medicine at school, you should give your child's school nurse or faculty member a separate bottle of your child's medicine. That way, the person can give your child a dose at the right time. Do not let your child keep the medicine in his or her school bag or desk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81464192\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child has have side effects?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the most common side effects include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not feeling hungry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p/><p>Most of these side effects are mild and go away after a few weeks. Some can be avoided by changing the way the medicine is given. Rarely, ADHD medicines can have more serious side effects. Your child's doctor or nurse will discuss these with you before your child starts the medicine.</p><p>For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for the patient hand-out from Lexicomp available through UpToDate. It explains how to use each medicine, describes its possible side effects, and lists other medicines or foods that can affect how it works.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81464209\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=learning-disabilities-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Learning disabilities (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
