It is a very common medical complaint in primary care patients, and the same is true for patients in palliative care, which is illustrated by studies that report that the prevalence of insomnia is over 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Insomnia is associated with multiple consequences that have a negative impact on quality of life and the ability to perform normal functions. In addition, insomnia is a strong predictor of the development of psychiatric disorders.

Patients receiving palliative care may vary in terms of their functional status and where they are in their personal trajectory in a chronic illness. As a result, the approach and treatment to insomnia in these patients should be individualized.

Whenever possible, clinicians should attempt to treat potentially reversible causes of insomnia (eg, pain control, suppression of cough, treatment for depression). In addition, patients who experience symptoms in addition to insomnia may be best managed by the administration of agents that list somnolence as a side effect (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> for depression, nausea, or appetite stimulation). At the same time, however, agents used to treat insomnia should have as little risk as possible of causing or exacerbating other conditions (eg, delirium).</p><p>The approach to insomnia should take into account the patient&rsquo;s clinical status. Patients receiving palliative care but who maintain a relatively better prognosis and have minimal comorbid conditions will likely tolerate typical pharmacologic treatments for insomnia similarly to medically healthy individuals. However, patients who are approaching end of life or are more debilitated may be more susceptible to the side effects of pharmacologic treatment due to concerns over drug-drug interactions or the presence of end-organ impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care/abstract/2,14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14,20</a>]. Thus, when used, a heightened awareness of the potential adverse effects of any proposed treatment is necessary, but also the goals of care must be considered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519785601\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no prospective studies that inform an evidence-based approach, common steps include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519785655\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptom management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should aim to aggressively manage symptoms associated with sleep disturbances in the particular patient. For example, for patients who cannot sleep due to pain, the use of long-acting pain medications (or titration of doses at night) may help provide relief. Symptom management also includes removal of or the judicious dosing of any stimulating agents that might be exacerbating insomnia, such as steroids and psychostimulants. For example, if agents with stimulant properties (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>) are required, they should be administered in the morning and not later in the day. For patients exhibiting signs of spiritual distress, this also includes the involvement of chaplaincy.

For example, if patients complain of discomfort due to their beds, the use of foam &ldquo;egg crate&rdquo; or memory foam mattress toppers can help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519785676\"><span class=\"h3\">Encourage healthy sleep-wake cycles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Helping to modulate a more normal circadian rhythm can restore sleep in patients. For example, increased exercise and regular exposure to daylight for at least an hour every morning have been shown to restore sleep cycles among patients with Alzheimer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Light exposure can be accomplished using artificial full-spectrum or blue lights when natural daylight exposure is not possible. </p><p>In addition, clinicians should encourage the maintenance of familiar routines so long as the patient is able. For example, if a patient routinely showers and has a snack prior to bed, then this routine should be continued when feasible. As a disease progresses, alternate bedtime routines may be created to allow for the types of activities that are tolerated by the patient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456903800\"><span class=\"h3\">Minimize disruptions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians and staff should minimize disruptions of a patient&rsquo;s sleep.

Although there are no prospective data to demonstrate efficacy in patients in palliative care, behavioral therapies should be tried initially because they avoid the potential risks associated with medications. Examples of these therapies include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Behavioral therapy'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep hygiene training (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F71116\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71116 \">table 1</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mindfulness meditation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation techniques </p><p/><p>While mindfulness-based interventions have been found to be beneficial for a variety of indications in hospice and palliative care settings, there are no studies evaluating mindfulness-based techniques for treating insomnia in palliative care.

Additional research is needed in palliative care populations.</p><p>There are no studies specifically evaluating the benefits of CBT to treat insomnia in palliative care populations. In a meta-analysis of eight randomized trials that compared CBT with control conditions (eg, waitlist control, usual care, or sleep education) in 752 cancer survivors with insomnia, self-reported sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, frequency of waking after sleep onset, and insomnia severity each improved more with CBT, and the clinical effects favoring CBT ranged from small to large [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3606866\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The palliative care patient may have a varying sensitivity and risk associated with the use of the common pharmacologic treatments for insomnia. As noted above, patients who encounter palliative care early in their disease trajectory, when they are still relatively healthy, may tolerate and respond to typical sleep aids as well as a medically healthy patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>.)</p><p>Patients at an advanced stage of illness are more likely to suffer adverse effects from sleep aids. Thus, we suggest that medications be prescribed for insomnia only after attempting nonpharmacologically based modifications, as discussed earlier. In addition, careful attention to associated symptoms may be especially important in this population because of the risk of unintended consequences. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a patient has insomnia as a result of delirium, prescribing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a> or using the over-the-counter agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> to treat insomnia is likely to worsen the delirium. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may experience worsened respiratory function when prescribed benzodiazepines.</p><p/><p>In the absence of prospective data, the approach to the selection of a sleep aid should be individualized, and the lowest effective dose should be administered. As with most drugs, patients in palliative care must be carefully and continually monitored for both positive effect and the development of adverse effects, particularly as the patient&rsquo;s disease progresses.

It can potentially be helpful in patients with sleep phase disruption. In contrast to benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists, it is non-habit forming and does not appear to have the side effects associated with other hypnotics. Ramelteon does, however, have important drug-drug interactions that should be carefully considered, especially in palliative care patients who may be on a number of different agents. It is metabolized primarily through the CYP450 1A2 pathway, thus it should not be coadministered with other potent inhibitors of this pathway, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>. Although there are no trials specifically addressing the benefit and risks in palliative care populations, growing evidence suggests that it is safe. In our view, a time-limited trial of ramelteon is reasonable for carefully selected patients as long as they are frequently assessed for efficacy and side effects.</p><p>In randomized trials conducted in general populations, short-term use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramelteon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramelteon</a> is associated with improvement in some sleep parameters in patients with insomnia, but the effect size is relatively small. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Melatonin agonists'</a>.) </p><p>There are no data on the efficacy or safety of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramelteon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramelteon</a> in palliative care populations. However, at least some data support safety. Ramelteon was investigated to prevent delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] in severely medically ill older adult patients in the intensive care unit, as well as on a standard medical floor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. While not specifically termed &ldquo;palliative care patients,&rdquo; this study patient population may indicate potential safety for the types of patients typically seen in palliative care. Compared with placebo, use of ramelteon was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of delirium, but notably, there were significant differences in sleep or insomnia measures between the ramelteon and placebo groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

However, the side effects, primarily related to the anticholinergic action (eg, dry mouth, decreased cognitive function, delirium), the rapid development of tolerance, and the lack of safety data in palliative care patients should discourage their widespread use, particularly in the palliative care context. Anticholinergic agents in general are common contributors to delirium. We do not use diphenhydramine in our own practice as a treatment for insomnia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Diphenhydramine'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519785899\"><span class=\"h4\">Melatonin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Melatonin is a neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland that can assist with maintaining sleep-wake cycle. It is a widely available over-the-counter agent that is often used to alleviate insomnia, despite the lack of prospective data, as well as other conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-and-available-preparations-of-melatonin#H14099730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology and available preparations of melatonin&quot;, section on 'Clinical uses'</a>.) </p><p>Unfortunately, double-blind placebo-controlled trials have not demonstrated consistent findings in terms of dose-response relationships, benefits, and risks, although most experts believe that, at doses ranging from 0.3 mg to 20 mg, melatonin is well tolerated without adverse effects. In general, it does not appear to be particularly effective for insomnia in most patients, with the possible exception of patients who have delayed sleep phase syndrome and in a subgroup of patients with low melatonin levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Over-the-counter'</a>.) </p><p>In our experience, melatonin has been modestly effective in reducing initial sleep latency and frequent nighttime or early morning awakenings for patients receiving palliative care, although we acknowledge the lack of prospective data to confirm this impression.

This subject is addressed in detail separately.

This in turn can make them more susceptible to the adverse effects of sleep aides. Therefore, it is important to maximize treatment and palliation of any comorbid conditions as the primary approach to treatment of insomnia. </p><p>In addition, there are known changes in sleep structure and quality that occur with aging, including increased and prolonged nighttime awakenings, reduced sleep efficiency, reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced time spent in deep sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These can result in increased daytime fatigue and more frequent napping. Given the potentially increased risk for adverse outcomes with pharmacologic agents, it is our practice to prescribe nonpharmacologic interventions such as education regarding sleep hygiene. If drugs are necessary, choose drugs with the fewest likely adverse effects, start at the lowest potential effective dose, and use time-limited trials; note that for most hypnotics, starting doses are lower for older adult patients. For patients taking a pharmacologic sleep aid, frequent reassessments should be performed for efficacy, continued need, and the development of adverse effects. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H357920458\"><span class=\"h3\">Dementia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with dementia are at an increased risk for experiencing insomnia as a potential symptom of their underlying dementia illness or from associated conditions (eg, sundowning, agitation, or other delirium). A broader discussion of these issues is covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of new or worsening symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Management of insomnia in patients with dementia should include gathering a comprehensive history, ensuring medical conditions are maximally treated, addressing polypharmacy with regard to sleep-related side effects, and teaching care providers the basics of good sleep hygiene. Nonpharmacologic interventions that focus on environmental restructuring and maintenance of consistent sleep patterns are the mainstays of therapy. Maximizing exposure to natural light in the mornings and light exercise, when feasible, can help entrain more normal circadian rhythms. </p><p>There are no controlled trials to support the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy interventions for the routine management of insomnia or other sleep-wake disturbances in this patient population. In a 2014 Cochrane review of sleep aides for patients with Alzheimer disease, data were only available for melatonin (n = 209), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trazodone</a> (n = 30), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramelteon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramelteon</a> (n = 74) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Of the three agents reviewed, trazodone was the only one to increase total nocturnal sleep time and improve total sleep efficiency. (See <a href=\"#H519785856\" class=\"local\">'Sedating antidepressants'</a> above.)</p><p>There was a lack of high-quality data to support use of any pharmacologic agent in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease, which highlights the need for clinical trials in this population and, more broadly, for patients receiving palliative care. Of importance, older adults with cognitive impairment have increased susceptibility to a variety of medication-related side effects (eg, drowsiness, confusion, gait instability).

Impaired sleep in caregivers increases irritability, depression, anger, and guilt, and decreases overall ability to provide care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Disrupted sleep is common among caregivers. In a systematic review of 10 published studies, 72 percent of caregivers reported moderate to severe sleep disturbance, and some experienced up to a 44 percent reduction in total sleep time (from the typical eight hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The caregivers describe a negative impact on mood, irritability, anxiety, and finding themselves falling asleep in dangerous situations, such as while driving. A significant factor impacting the caregivers&rsquo; sleep was the insomnia of the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3606894\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insomnia is a condition of impaired sleep, with difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> experiencing sleep as nonrestorative and unrefreshing, despite having the appropriate opportunity for sleep to occur. It is estimated that insomnia affects over 70 percent of palliative care patients. (See <a href=\"#H30904714\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If patients receiving palliative care report insomnia, clinicians should evaluate other factors that may contribute to sleep disturbances, which can potentially be addressed. (See <a href=\"#H519785078\" class=\"local\">'Associated factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to insomnia should take into account the patient&rsquo;s clinical status. Patients receiving palliative care but who maintain a relatively better prognosis and have minimal comorbid conditions will likely tolerate typical pharmacologic treatments for insomnia similarly to medically healthy individuals. However, patients who are approaching the end of life or are more debilitated may be more susceptible to the side effects of pharmacologic treatment due to concerns over drug-drug interactions or the presence of end-organ impairment. (See <a href=\"#H370494283\" class=\"local\">'Treatment approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should aim to aggressively manage symptoms associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> contributing to sleep disturbances in the particular patient. (See <a href=\"#H519785655\" class=\"local\">'Symptom management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Addressing environmental issues may help address external factors exacerbating insomnia in these patients. This includes keeping patient rooms cool, well ventilated, and with low light at night, the use of white noise machines, and limitations on the use of computers at night and other stimuli (eg, television, loud music). (See <a href=\"#H456903686\" class=\"local\">'Addressing the environment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of lifestyle modifications may promote a more regular sleep pattern and can be instituted in a palliative care setting. These include reducing or avoiding daytime naps, large meals before bedtime, drinking a large amount of fluid in the evening, or stimulants, including caffeine. Daytime light exposure and activity levels should be increased when possible. (See <a href=\"#H519785837\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle modifications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians and staff should minimize disruptions of a patient&rsquo;s sleep. Regardless of setting, dimming lights in the vicinity of the palliative care patient&rsquo;s room may provide a simple cue to others to maintain a calm, quiet, sleep-promoting environment. (See <a href=\"#H456903800\" class=\"local\">'Minimize disruptions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with persistent insomnia despite environmental-associated modifications, behavioral therapy is the first line of treatment of insomnia. Although there are no prospective data to demonstrate efficacy in patients in palliative care, behavioral therapies should be tried initially because they avoid the potential risks associated with medications. (See <a href=\"#H456903843\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that medications be prescribed for insomnia only after attempting nonpharmacologically based modifications. There is no single pharmacologic approach that can be recommended for all patients. The approach to the selection of a sleep aid must be individualized, and the lowest effective dose should be administered. As with most drugs, patients in palliative care must be carefully and continually monitored for both positive effect and the development of adverse effects, particularly as the patient&rsquo;s disease progresses. (See <a href=\"#H3606866\" class=\"local\">'Medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should be cognizant of the impact of insomnia on the sleep quality of other members in the patient&rsquo;s family and friends, particularly among those who act as the primary caregivers. The negative impact on caregivers may affect the ability of the patient to remain at home. (See <a href=\"#H30905043\" class=\"local\">'Impact to caregivers'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-palliative-care/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Costa e Silva JA, Chase M, Sartorius N, Roth T.
