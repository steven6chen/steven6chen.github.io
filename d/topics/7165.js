The definition, differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, and management of fever in the ICU are reviewed here. The pathophysiology of fever is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-fever-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and treatment of fever in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22450950\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal body temperature is approximately 37&ordm;C (98.6&ordm;F), although this varies with the time of day and the method of measurement used. The definition of fever is arbitrary; as the temperature that defines fever is lowered, its sensitivity increases and its specificity decreases. A joint task force from the American College of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America defined fever as a body temperature of 38.3&ordm;C (101&ordm;F) or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. We adhere to this definition in this review because it is widely accepted. It is reasonable to use a lower temperature to define fever in immunocompromised patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional means of measuring temperature in the ICU include core measurements (intravascular, intravesicular [ie, bladder], and rectal), and peripheral measurements (, oral and axillary), the former being more accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. The gold standard is the thermistor on a pulmonary artery catheter, although these are used infrequently and may give unreliable temperature readings if the catheter is used to rapidly administer volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Regardless of which method is chosen, the same method and site of measurement should be used repeatedly to facilitate the trending of serial measurements. Alternative methods, such as axillary, temporal artery, tympanic, and chemical dot monitors, should not be used because they are inaccurate during critical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/1,6,8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,8-13</a>]. Despite this inaccuracy, these methods are still in widespread use in many ICUs around the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22451247\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever complicates up to 70 percent of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and is often due to an infection or another serious condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In one observational study of 24,204 adult ICU admissions, fever &ge;39.5&ordm;C (103&ordm;F) was associated with an increase in mortality (20 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Fever has also been associated with an increased length of stay, increased cost of care, and poorer outcomes in patients with traumatic head injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/15,17-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17-23</a>]. The same associations probably exist with other conditions that have not been studied. Fever may prompt unnecessary investigations and lead to inappropriate antibiotic use.</p><p>The importance of fever as a pathophysiological process is poorly understood. Although regarded as a sign of clinical deterioration, fever can be an appropriate adaptive response to infection. For example, one study showed that elevated peak temperatures in ICU patients with infections were associated with decreased hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Compared to patients with peak temperatures 36.5 to 36.9&ordm;C, patients with peak temperatures 39 to 39.4<sup>o</sup>C had significantly lower hospital mortality (OR, 0.56; 95% CI 0.48-0.66). However, in non-infectious cases of fever, mortality increased with rising temperature (OR, 2.07; 95% CI 1.68-2.55).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sources of fever in the ICU may be infectious (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73551 \">table 1</a>) or noninfectious (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68779\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68779 \">table 2</a>). The relative frequency of infectious and noninfectious fevers varies according to the population being studied and the definition of infection that is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Distinguishing between infectious and noninfectious fevers is challenging, but the magnitude of the fever may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/8,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25,26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fevers between 38.3&ordm;C (101&ordm;F) and 38.8&ordm;C (101.8&ordm;F) may be infectious or noninfectious. The differential diagnosis is longest in this range; fortunately, most noninfectious sources of fever can be excluded by a detailed history and physical examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fevers between 38.9 (102&ordm;F) and 41&ordm;C (105.8&ordm;F) can be assumed to be infectious.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fevers &ge;41.1&ordm;C (106&ordm;F) are usually noninfectious. Examples include drug fever, transfusion reactions, adrenal insufficiency, thyroid storm, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, heat stroke, and malignant hyperthermia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe nonexertional hyperthermia (classic heat stroke) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant hyperthermia: Clinical diagnosis and management of acute crisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many infectious sources of fever (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73551 \">table 1</a>). The most common in the ICU include ventilator-associated pneumonia, intravascular catheter-related infections, surgical site infections, catheter-related urinary tract infections, and bacteremia from these and other sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) &ndash; VAP is usually suspected when a patient who has been receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours develops a fever that is accompanied by a new or progressive pulmonary infiltrate, leukocytosis, and purulent tracheobronchial secretions. These signs may be accompanied by an increased respiratory rate, increased minute volume, decreased tidal volume, decreased oxygenation, or the need for more ventilatory support or inspired oxygen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravascular catheter-related infection &ndash; Intravascular catheter-related infections commonly present as a fever without localizing symptoms or signs. Alternative presentations include cellulitis at the insertion site, purulent drainage from the insertion site, incidentally detected bacteremia, sepsis (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis), severe sepsis (sepsis plus organ dysfunction), or septic shock (eg, severe sepsis plus shock). Rarely, a patient may present with suppurative thrombophlebitis, endocarditis, or septic abscesses. Arterial catheters have comparable infection rates to central venous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arterial-catheterization-techniques-for-invasive-monitoring#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arterial catheterization techniques for invasive monitoring&quot;, section on 'Infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of intravascular catheter infections&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of central venous catheters and their prevention&quot;, section on 'Catheter-related infection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical site infection &ndash; A surgical site infection should be considered in any postoperative patient with a fever. Most surgical site infections occur one to four weeks after surgery, although they may occasionally occur during the first postoperative week or more than a month after surgery. The clinical manifestations and likely pathogen depend upon the surgical site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catheter-related urinary tract infections &ndash; The incidence of catheter-related urinary tract infections has probably been overestimated because many studies did not distinguish asymptomatic bacteriuria from a genuine urinary tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Catheter-related urinary tract infections may present as a fever without localizing symptoms or signs. They may also present with symptoms and signs of cystitis (fever, suprapubic pain, hematuria, pyuria), pyelonephritis (fever, chills, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, nausea, and vomiting), or urosepsis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteremia &ndash; Bacteremia may be secondary to any of the above infections, as well as many others. Fever may be the only sign of bacteremia, although it can rapidly progress to sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection is a rare, but life-threatening, complication of hospital care that does not always occur during transfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinusitis &ndash; Sinusitis occurs in eight percent of all ICU patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], but is more common among mechanically ventilated patients who have sinus opacification on imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. It most typically manifests as fever without localizing symptoms and signs, since most patients are mechanically ventilated and unable to communicate the presence of a headache and sinus tenderness. Purulent nasal drainage is occasionally present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients#H4044236103\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients&quot;, section on 'Sinusitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p>All of the infections described above have the potential to progress to sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sepsis syndromes in adults: Epidemiology, definitions, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Noninfectious causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many noninfectious sources of fever in the ICU (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68779\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68779 \">table 2</a>). In most cases, the fever is not the only sign and, therefore, the cause can usually be identified with a detailed history and physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The noninfectious causes of fever may be conceptualized as those that are accompanied by distributive shock and those that are not. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults#H2750341\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Distributive'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Noninfectious fever without shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninfectious causes of fever that are usually not accompanied by shock include transfusion reactions, drug fever, certain intra-abdominal conditions (eg, acalculous cholecystitis, mesenteric ischemia, pancreatitis), and thromboembolic disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-hemolytic transfusion reaction &ndash; Fever is the most common sign of a non-hemolytic transfusion reaction. It generally occurs within one to six hours after the initiation of a transfusion of red blood cells or platelets and may be accompanied by chills and mild dyspnea. Non-hemolytic reactions are benign with no lasting sequelae, but can be uncomfortable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Febrile nonhemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug fever &ndash; Drug fever is a diagnostic challenge. It can occur several days after the initiation of the drug, can take several days to subside after cessation of the drug, and can produce high fevers (ie, &gt;38.9&ordm;C [102&ordm;F]) without other signs. The true incidence is unknown. It is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion unless other signs of hypersensitivity (eg, rash) are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acalculous cholecystitis &ndash; Acalculous cholecystitis is associated with a variety of clinical conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82539\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82539 \">table 3</a>). It generally presents with fever, leukocytosis, and vague abdominal discomfort. A right upper quadrant mass may be palpable. An insidious presentation is associated with gallbladder gangrene and perforation. Acalculous cholecystitis may have a mortality rate as high as 30 to 40 percent, even with treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acalculous cholecystitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mesenteric ischemia &ndash; Fever is a late sign in both arterial and venous mesenteric ischemia. It usually signifies bowel infarction, by which time other signs have usually developed such as abdominal tenderness, hematochezia, or lactic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The abdominal tenderness is typically periumbilical, may be severe and out of proportion to the physical exam findings, and may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute pancreatitis &ndash; Acute pancreatitis is typically accompanied by abdominal pain, tenderness, and distension, as well as nausea and vomiting. Abdominal pain due to pancreatitis is typically improved by leaning forward. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) &ndash; DVT is common among ICU patients, with an incidence that has been estimated to be 12 to 33 percent depending upon the patient populations studied and type of prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. However, DVT is a rare cause of fever. More common manifestations of DVT include asymmetric extremity edema, pain, or erythema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-deep-vein-thrombosis-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary embolism (PE) &ndash; The Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) study about PE in hospitalized patients (not necessarily ICU patients) detected fever with the following frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>14 percent when defined as &gt;37.8&ordm;C (&gt;100&ordm;F)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>6 percent when defined as &gt;38.3&ordm;C (&gt;101&ordm;F)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>1.5 percent when defined as &gt;38.9&ordm;C (&gt;102&ordm;F)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Noninfectious fever with shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninfectious causes of fever that are frequently accompanied by shock include adrenal crisis (ie, acute adrenal insufficiency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], thyroid storm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], and an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. The fever is often &gt;38.9&ordm;C (&gt;102&ordm;F) and the shock is distributive, which is characterized by hypotension, warm extremities, a hyperdynamic precordium (tachycardia, prominent heart sounds), oliguria, altered mental status, and metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults#H2750341\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Distributive'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adrenal crisis &ndash; An adrenal crisis usually occurs in patients with previously undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency who are subjected to a serious infection or other major stress, patients with known adrenal insufficiency who do not take more glucocorticoid during a serious infection or other major stress, patients with acute bilateral adrenal infarction or hemorrhage, or patients whose chronic glucocorticoid therapy is abruptly withdrawn. Distributive shock is the predominant manifestation of an adrenal crisis, but fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, fatigue, lethargy, hypoglycemia, confusion, or coma may also be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Adrenal crisis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid storm &ndash; Thyroid storm refers to severe, life-threatening thyrotoxicosis. It is often precipitated by an acute stressor, such as surgery, infection, trauma, or an acute iodine load. Clinical manifestations may include severe fever (&gt;40&ordm;C [&gt;104&ordm;F]), distributive shock, severe tachycardia (&gt;140 <span class=\"nowrap\">beat/min),</span> congestive heart failure, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, agitation, delirium, psychosis, stupor, and coma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-storm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid storm&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction &ndash; An acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is a medical emergency that results from the rapid destruction of donor red blood cells by recipient antibodies. It is usually due to ABO incompatibility. Some acquired alloantibodies are occasionally implicated. Common clinical manifestations include fever, chills, distributive shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute kidney injury. Flank pain, red or brown urine, and bleeding occur less often. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough review of the medical history and a full physical examination should be performed whenever a patient develops an unexplained fever in the ICU. Blood cultures are the only mandatory diagnostic tests in patients with a new fever; the rationale is that clinical findings cannot reliably exclude bacteremia and mortality is high without appropriate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Further investigation may be indicated depending upon the clinical assessment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sputum &ndash; Sputum Gram stain and culture are indicated for febrile patients with any of the following findings: new sputum production; a change in the color, amount, or thickness of their sputum; a new or progressive pulmonary infiltrate; an increased respiratory rate; an increased minute volume; a decreased tidal volume; decreased oxygenation; needing more ventilatory support; or requiring more inspired oxygen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, and diagnosis of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine &ndash; Urinalysis and urine culture are indicated for febrile patients with a urethral catheter, urinary obstruction, renal calculi, recent genitourinary surgery or trauma, or neutropenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sampling and evaluation of voided urine in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest imaging &ndash; A chest radiograph is easily obtainable in the ICU and worthwhile in many patients with respiratory symptoms or signs. It may detect a new or progressive pulmonary infiltrate, distinguish pneumonia from tracheobronchitis, or identify a respiratory source of fever other than pneumonia or tracheobronchitis that would otherwise be missed because it is not associated with sputum production. However, chest radiographs are less helpful and, therefore, should be used more judiciously in patients with known pleural effusions, acute lung injury, or acute respiratory distress syndrome because such abnormalities may obscure other findings. Computed tomography (CT) should be reserved for the clarification of abnormal chest radiographic findings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies &ndash; Transaminase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, lipase, and lactate measurements are indicated for patients with abdominal pain or whose abdominal exam cannot be reliably assessed due to sedation or coma. Serum sodium, potassium, glucose, and cortisol levels should be drawn if adrenal insufficiency is possible. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), T3, and T4 levels should be drawn if thyroid storm is possible. And, blood should be drawn for measurement of direct antiglobulin test, plasma free hemoglobin, and haptoglobin, as well as a repeat blood type and cross-match if an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is suspected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Procalcitonin (PCT) and the endotoxin activity assay are adjunctive diagnostic tools for distinguishing fever due to infection from noninfectious fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. We believe that such assays should be used as a last resort until the benefits of each are clarified, even though several professional organizations have endorsed them as reasonable measures. Currently, the body of evidence for PCT testing is conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>] and the body of evidence for the endotoxin activity assay is scarce [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. C-reactive protein (CRP) has also been studied as a biomarker for identifying infection, but it appears less promising because it lacks specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>], rises later than PCT, doesn&rsquo;t correlate as well with severity of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], and tends to be lower among patients with liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Both PCT and CRP predict mortality in ICU patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal imaging &ndash; Abdominal imaging is indicated for patients with symptoms or signs of an intraabdominal process, but for whom the laboratory testing has not identified the cause of the symptoms or signs. It is also indicated for patients who have a reason to have an intraabdominal infection (eg, recent abdominal surgery) and no alternative source of the fever has been identified, even if there are no symptoms or signs of an abdominal process. Finally, abdominal imaging may be indicated if laboratory testing suggests a possible intra-abdominal process, but the results are insufficient to identify the exact abnormality. As an example, in a patient with fever, transaminitis, and hyperbilirubinemia, a right upper quadrant ultrasound exam may determine whether there is acalculous cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, or a primary hepatic condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus evaluation &ndash; Evaluation for sinusitis is appropriate for mechanically ventilated patients who have purulent nasal drainage or whose evaluation has otherwise been completely negative. The evaluation begins with a radiographic evaluation looking for sinus opacification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. CT is the preferred modality, but sinus radiographs and sinus ultrasound are reasonable alternatives. Culture of sinus fluid obtained by endoscopic-guided middle meatal aspiration is indicated for patients with sinus opacification and no other cause for fever. Interpretation of the culture results and the role of empiric therapy are discussed separately.

First, clinicians should remain mindful that critically ill patients often have more than one infection. Second, evidence of infection and inflammation (eg, leukocytosis, pus) may be altered if the patient is immunosuppressed. Finally, medical technologies (eg, continuous renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) can modify or mask a fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of fever should be directed at its underlying cause, which is discussed in separate topic reviews.</p><p>Perhaps the two most common clinical decisions that need to be made when a patient develops a new fever in the intensive care unit (ICU) are whether or not empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted and whether or not the patient&rsquo;s intravascular catheters need to be removed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effects of empiric antibiotics initiated for fever in a heterogeneous population of critically ill patients have not been studied. However, there is evidence in patients with suspected severe sepsis or septic shock that a shorter time to appropriate antibiotic administration is associated with lower mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/43,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,56</a>]. There is also evidence that appropriate antibiotic therapy dramatically reduces mortality among patients with neutropenia and fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Infection of ventricular assist devices can be catastrophic, as device removal is often not possible without concurrent transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. On the basis of this evidence, we recommend that patients in the ICU who develop a new fever be treated with empiric antibiotics if they are deteriorating, in shock, neutropenic, or have a ventricular assist device. We also believe the empiric therapy is warranted for patients who have a temperature &ge;38.9&ordm;C (&ge;102&ordm;F) because most fevers in this range will be infectious. For most other patients, further diagnostic work-up with ongoing clinical assessment prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy is reasonable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether or not to routinely remove an intravascular catheter (or other device) in a febrile patient is a controversial and evolving issue. Generally speaking, considerations in the decision include the severity of illness, age of the catheter, and probability that the catheter is the source of fever. The management of a catheter in the setting of possible intravascular catheter-related infections is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Catheter management'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Fever itself does not generally require treatment with antipyretics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>) or external cooling (ie, cooling blanket, ice packs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>], and some evidence suggests that the use of antipyretics may worsen outcomes in sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Exceptions to this are when the fever may be detrimental to the outcome (eg, increased intracranial pressure) or is &ge;41&ordm;C (&ge;105.8&ordm;F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. If body temperature exceeds the &ldquo;critical thermal maximum&rdquo;, which is thought to be between 41.6&ordm;C and 42&ordm;C, life-threatening complications can ensue (eg, rhabdomyolysis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

In addition, mortality was unaffected by acetaminophen, although this outcome was inadequately assessed.</p><p/><p>Several ongoing randomized controlled trials should help clarify the role of antipyretics and external cooling in critically ill patients.

Whether intravenous or enteral acetaminophen should be used is unknown, although our preference is for enteral administration, when feasible. Several studies reported that the incidence of hypotension (systolic blood pressure &le;90 mmHg or &ge;20 percent decrease from baseline) was higher after parenteral acetaminophen compared with enteral administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4139741\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal body temperature is approximately 37&ordm;C (98.6&ordm;F), although this varies with the time of day and the method of measurement used. We define a fever as a body temperature of 38.3&ordm;C (101&ordm;F) or higher.
