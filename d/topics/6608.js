Clinical suspicion of neonatal encephalopathy should be considered in any infant exhibiting an abnormal level of consciousness, seizures, tone and reflex abnormalities, apnea, aspiration, feeding difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>], and an abnormal hearing screen.</p><p>This topic will review the etiology and pathogenesis of neonatal encephalopathy. Other clinical aspects of this syndrome are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Neonatal encephalopathy&quot; has emerged as the preferred term to describe central nervous system dysfunction in the newborn period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) describes neonatal encephalopathy as a clinically defined syndrome of disturbed neurologic function in the earliest days of life in an infant born at or beyond 35 weeks of gestation, manifested by a subnormal level of consciousness or seizures, and often accompanied by difficulty with initiating and maintaining respiration and depression of tone and reflexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The terminology does not imply a specific underlying pathophysiology, which is appropriate since the nature of brain injury causing neurologic impairment in a newborn is poorly understood. While neonatal encephalopathy was once automatically ascribed to hypoxia-ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], it is now known that hypoxia-ischemia is only one of many possible contributors to neonatal encephalopathy. Whether a particular newborn's encephalopathy can be attributed to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is often unclear.</p><p>Some investigators require stringent criteria for using the term neonatal encephalopathy, such as two or more symptoms of encephalopathy lasting over 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], while others require no more than a low five minute Apgar score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, the use of Apgar scores alone is problematic, as Apgar scores may be low due to maternal analgesia or prematurity, or can be normal in the presence of acute hypoxia-ischemic injury.</p><p>Neonatal encephalopathy usually refers to central nervous system dysfunction in term and near term infants, but for the purposes of this review, encephalopathy of the preterm infant has also been included.</p><p>When neonatal encephalopathy is indisputably due to hypoxic-ischemic (anoxic) brain injury (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hypoxic-ischemic injury'</a> below), it is appropriate to use the term hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Since the precise cause and temporal onset of neonatal encephalopathy is unknown in most cases, some experts advocate calling the condition &ldquo;presumed HIE&rdquo; or &ldquo;apparent HIE&rdquo; when the clinical features and neonatal brain injury patterns on MRI suggest that HIE is the most likely mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Others favor using the non-specific term &ldquo;neonatal encephalopathy&rdquo; whenever there is doubt as to the underlying mechanism of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It remains to be established whether neuroimaging or other testing can one day be used as a gold standard for determining when prenatal hypoxia, birth asphyxia, or hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is responsible for neonatal encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of insult</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common but crucial problem is the inability to time the onset, duration, magnitude, and the single or repetitive nature of the exact insult that causes brain injury resulting in neonatal encephalopathy. This is an important point to consider in view of neuroprotective therapies such as hypothermia. The uncertain timing and etiology of brain injury in most cases of neonatal encephalopathy also fuels birth injury malpractice litigation. Malpractice cases, and too often clinicians, typically focus on events around the time of delivery, which happens to be the time (hours) when the majority of data from pregnant women are obtained, whereas the rest of pregnancy is relatively unmonitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, it is usually unknown whether the ultimate brain injury is caused by the events only around delivery or by cumulative insults throughout pregnancy.</p><p>The definition of asphyxia is &quot;&hellip;a condition of impaired blood gas exchange leading, if it persists, to progressive hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Diagnosis requires a blood gas&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, even with state-of-art monitoring, there is presently no reliable measure of brain function, brain oxygenation, or cerebral blood flow during the prenatal period or even in the intrapartum period. Therefore, the terms &quot;birth asphyxia&quot; and &quot;fetal distress&quot; are not always used appropriately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Data from studies of neonatal encephalopathy using brain MRI, near-infrared spectroscopy and electroencephalogram monitoring suggest that the immediate perinatal period is important for evolution of brain injury in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. One report evaluated 351 term infants with either neonatal encephalopathy (defined as the presence of abnormal tone, feeding difficulties, altered alertness, and at least three of several criteria suggesting possible perinatal hypoxic-ischemia) or seizures alone during the first three days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Brain MRI was performed in the first one to two weeks after birth.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the group with encephalopathy, lesions suggestive of acute brain injury were found in 80 percent; most of the lesions were bilateral abnormalities in basal ganglia, thalami, cortex, or white matter, although focal infarction was detected in eight infants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the group with only neonatal seizures, acute ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes were found in 69 percent.</p><p/><p>Clinical signs that point to an early antenatal onset of neonatal encephalopathy include intrauterine growth restriction, small head size (if both head and body size are small then the insult could be in the first two trimesters of pregnancy), contractures, and features suggestive of arthrogryposis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few studies have adequately evaluated risk factors for neonatal encephalopathy other than hypoxia-ischemia. The studies evaluating prenatal and obstetric factors often include symptoms but not pathogenic events that could provide information regarding the timing of the hypoxic-ischemic event. Epidemiologic population studies of neonatal encephalopathy typically lack brain MRI data to determine the presence and degree of brain injury, and also lack information regarding long-term outcomes. In contrast, studies of neonatal encephalopathy that do include neuroimaging data are rarely population-based, and are underpowered to determine the effect of a broad range of maternal antenatal risk factors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large population-based cohort of cases of neonatal encephalopathy from Western Australia, 69 percent had only antepartum risk factors, 25 percent had both antepartum and intrapartum risk factors, 4 percent had evidence of only intrapartum hypoxia, and 2 percent had no identified risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, approximately 70 percent of neonatal encephalopathy cases were associated with events arising before the onset of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, in a registry of over 4100 infants with neonatal encephalopathy, 46 percent had fetal risk factors and 27 percent had maternal risk factors predating the onset of labor, while only 15 percent had a clinically recognized sentinel event capable of causing asphyxia (35 percent if fetal bradycardia was included as an indicator) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case-control study from the UK, 405 term infants with encephalopathy were compared with 239 neurologically normal infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Overall, 7 percent of cases had only antepartum factors, 20 percent had only intrapartum factors, 70 percent had both antepartum and intrapartum factors, and 4 percent had no identifiable risk factors for the development of neonatal encephalopathy. Limitations of this study include potential bias related to differences in the populations (eg, compared with controls, cases were from different years of collection, had a greater incidence of intrauterine growth restriction and twinning, and were more likely to have mothers who were younger, primipara, and of non-Caucasian origin), the exclusion of infection, the absence of placental data, the absence of a diagnosis of chorioamnionitis, and inclusion of some questionable intrapartum factors such as induced labor and variable decelerations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case-control study from Italy compared 27 term infants with neonatal encephalopathy and 100 control infants, suggesting a combination of antepartum and intrapartum events explain moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Compared with controls, neonates with encephalopathy had more frequent antepartum (74 percent versus 18 percent) and intrapartum (67 percent versus 19 percent) risk factors, including acute intrapartum events (33 percent versus 2 percent). On the whole, 26 percent of cases of NE had only antepartum risk factors, 22 percent had only intrapartum risk factors, and , and 44 percent had a combination of the two.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case-control study in Ireland that compared 237 term infants with neonatal encephalopathy with 489 control infants, variables independently associated with neonatal encephalopathy included meconium, oligohydramnios, and obstetric complications, suggesting involvement of a combination of antepartum and intrapartum risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p>The disparate results of these reports are likely due to several reasons, including different <span class=\"nowrap\">inclusion/exclusion</span> criteria among the studies and the assessment of variables that do not necessarily lead to critical brain injury (eg, shoulder dystocia, meconium aspiration, and abnormal fetal heart rate rhythms are ominous only if associated with fetal hypoxia, which is rare).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Antepartum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of neonatal encephalopathy have their antecedents in the prenatal period. It is unknown whether neonatal encephalopathy occurs as a result of a single insult (such as hypoxia-ischemia), multiple insults (eg, infection plus hypoxia-ischemia), or combinations of acute or chronic conditions. In cases with multiple insults, it is possible that the one closest to birth might be only a minor event that tips the balance to irreversible injury.</p><p>The highest quality population-based study that evaluated risk factors for neonatal encephalopathy compared 164 infants with neonatal encephalopathy and 400 randomly selected controls from term infants born in Western Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Although most babies with neonatal encephalopathy do not meet the criteria of IUGR, a small hospital-based case-control study found that a greater proportion of infants with neonatal encephalopathy were below the 10th percentile of growth potential compared with controls, and the difference was statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These studies suggest that there are antenatal factors contributing to the brain injury. Unfortunately, IUGR provides no clue to the etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60212\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60212 \">figure 2</a>) because both external maternal and placental factors can affect fetal growth in addition to intrinsic factors.</p><p>Placental thrombosis, infection, and disturbed uteroplacental flow have also been associated with neonatal encephalopathy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a hospital-based case-control study comparing 93 cases of neonatal encephalopathy to 387 controls, placental findings of fetal thrombotic vasculopathy, funisitis, and accelerated villous maturation were independently associated with neonatal encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study found that the frequency of severe placental lesions was fivefold higher among 83 cases of neonatal encephalopathy from a medicolegal registry than among 250 controls (52 to 10 percent).

Early detection of recent hypoxic-ischemic insults depends upon apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements on MRI. Beyond a week after the onset of the insult, evidence of gray matter injury by neuroimaging is scant unless there is a significant decrease in volume of gray matter regions or an increase in ventricular size or obvious infarcts and hemorrhage. White matter injury is somewhat easier to detect by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), as the fractional anisotropy of white matter bundles normally increase with age, leading to an ability to detect minor decreases in fractional anisotropy in WM regions. However, while DTI is performed at some tertiary centers, it is not yet widely available in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of neuronal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoxia-ischemia initially causes energy failure and loss of mitochondrial function.

These include oxidative stress, with the production of reactive oxygen species and interaction with nitric oxide pathway to produce reactive nitrogen species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>It was once believed that reactive species caused damage only if antioxidant defenses were overwhelmed, thus upsetting the balance between oxidants and antioxidants.

Reperfusion exacerbates the oxidative stress with a burst of reactive oxygen species.</p><p>The response of the fetus to the hypoxic-ischemic insult determines the subsequent injurious cascades and the clinical manifestations that result.

Fetuses that showed a precipitous drop in brain ADC at the end of 40 minutes of global hypoxia manifested hypertonia and postural changes after birth, while those without a drop in ADC were relatively normal at birth. Thus, after the hypoxic-ischemic insult, the initial energy failure and oxidative stress probably play a critical role in subsequent cascades (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62126\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62126 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Excitotoxic injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excitotoxic cellular injury occurs via excess activation of glutamate receptors, which leads to several forms of cell death.

Repeated depolarization of a neuron by unregulated glutamate release results in accumulation of intracellular calcium. During hypoxia-ischemia, there is failure to rapidly pump synaptically released glutamate back across the cell membrane, resulting in exposure of NMDA receptors to accumulated glutamate, which leads to lethal elevation of intracellular calcium levels. The cascade of events initiated by this process also can induce apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AMPA and kainate receptors are both coupled to sodium and potassium ion channels.

It can result from a wide variety of conditions but often remains unexplained. The nature of brain injury causing neurologic impairment in a newborn is poorly understood. Hypoxia-ischemia is only one of many possible contributors to neonatal encephalopathy. Whether a particular newborn's encephalopathy can be attributed to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is often controversial. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 70 percent of neonatal encephalopathy cases are associated with events arising before the onset of labor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70341 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60212\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60212 \">figure 2</a>).
