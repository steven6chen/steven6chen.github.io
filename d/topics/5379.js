Familiarity with the medical conditions or cultural practices that mimic child abuse can facilitate arrival at the correct diagnosis, initiation of appropriate therapy, and avoidance of the consequences of an unnecessary evaluation of <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> report of suspected child abuse. One helpful distinguishing feature is that many abused children present with multiple types of injuries (eg, bruising and fractures). Identifying multiple types of injuries decreases the likelihood that a single medical entity has produced all of the findings although certain conditions (eg, osteogenesis imperfecta [OI]) provide exception to this rule. It is most appropriately a consideration in children with fractures. Though data is weak, easy bruising is often cited in children with OI. Rare cases of subdural collections and retinal hemorrhage in children with OI have also been reported. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the orthopedic manifestations of child abuse&quot;, section on 'Osteogenesis imperfecta'</a>.)</p><p>The medical literature contains many assertions of medical conditions being confused for abuse that are incompletely documented or speculative. Sometimes these assertions are challenged, and other times not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Ultimately, a clinician must consider the relative likelihoods of all potential conditions alongside the possibility that a child with a medical condition may, in addition, be abused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One study found that just under 5 percent of almost 3000 children evaluated for physical abuse had a cutaneous mimic (eg, Mongolian spot, impetigo, and bruising due to a bleeding disorder) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Six percent of children with cutaneous mimics still had &quot;high concern&quot; for child abuse when the full picture was considered. Another study found that 3 percent of these same children had non-cutaneous mimics, with or without a cutaneous finding; 7 percent of children with non-cutaneous mimics still had &quot;high concern&quot; for child abuse when the full picture was considered and another 21 percent had an &quot;intermediate level of concern&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Thus, the presence of a condition which mimics child abuse does not exclude the possibility that abuse has occurred. The full clinical picture including all historical features and physical findings must be assessed when abuse is suspected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BRUISES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bruises are the most common type of injury in abused children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition to intentional and unintentional traumatic bruising, the differential diagnosis of bruising includes a number of medical disorders, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin K deficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salicylate ingestion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoglobulin A vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura) and other vasculitides</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mongolian spots</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemangiomas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed sub-aponeurotic fluid mass</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding disorders include factor VIII and IX deficiencies, von Willebrand disease, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), platelet function abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia caused by leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. About 15 percent of children with hemophilias present in a way that may be confused with abuse. Only half of these children have a family history of a named bleeding disorder. While excess non-patterned bruising, or &quot;fingertip&quot; bruising may be seen, a more developed patterned bruise has not been described in these children. A minority of these children present with more serious bleeding, such as intracranial hemorrhage. Some secondary bleeding disorders including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and liver failure may result from trauma or create bleeding that mimics trauma.</p><p>Vitamin K deficiency most commonly occurs in the first three months of life with bleeding from mucosal surfaces, prior incisions such as circumcisions, cutaneous bruising and deeper muscle bruising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Rarely vitamin K deficiency occurs in children who malabsorb fat soluble vitamins (eg, cystic fibrosis or liver disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-k#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin K&quot;, section on 'Causes'</a>.)</p><p>An evaluation of the child's coagulation may be warranted either to detect the coagulopathy that often results from traumatic brain injury, or to test for coagulopathy that could result in bruising, retinal hemorrhage or intracranial bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The American Academy of Pediatrics has published guidance regarding the evaluation for bleeding disorders when child abuse is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The report encourages careful review of the child's past medical history, family medical history, and physical examination. Providers should remember that, epidemiologically, abusive bruising is much more common than inherited or acquired coagulopathy. When child abuse is suspected based upon bruising, the evaluation for child abuse and reporting to child protection should not be delayed awaiting the results of specialized coagulation testing or consultation with a pediatric hematologist.</p><p>For non-intracranial bleeding, a complete blood count with platelets (CBC) prothrombin time (PT) activated prothrombin time (aPTT) Von Willebrand's factor antigen, Von Willebrand's factor activity, and levels of factors VIII and IX are recommended.</p><p>For intracranial bleeding, Von Willebrand's studies may be omitted, but testing for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89150\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89150 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disseminated intravascular coagulation in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Laboratory evaluation'</a>). Many child abuse physicians also test for Factor XIII deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The recommendation indicates that when abuse is witnessed, injuries are clearly patterned so as to indicate abuse, or when there is medical evidence of abuse that does not include bleeding, coagulation studies may be unnecessary. When abnormalities are identified, consultation with a hematologist with pediatric expertise is encouraged before ordering more advanced testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Bleeding evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with bleeding symptoms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Salicylate exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Salicylate exposure (typically acute ingestion, but also possible with chronic ingestion or cutaneous exposure) can cause bruising because of decreased platelet adhesion and increase in capillary permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Children with acute salicylate ingestion usually have other clinical signs such as vomiting, hyperventilation, and metabolic acidosis. The diagnosis is confirmed with a measurement of plasma salicylate concentration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salicylate poisoning in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who have immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV; Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura [HSP]), Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Childhood (AHEC), Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy (AHEI), and other vasculitides have purpuric lesions caused by breakdown of the capillary walls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62546\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62546 \">picture 1</a>). These lesions may appear diffusely on the body in areas not typically associated with bruising from normal activities (eg, shins) and can be mistaken for child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The diagnosis of vasculitis is often suggested by the initial appearance (eg, palpable purpura), accompanying features such as abdominal pain, joint pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematuria in patients with IgAV (HSP), and when new bruises continue to develop under clinical supervision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Mongolian spots</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mongolian spots are common bluish-green areas of skin discoloration often seen in African-American, Hispanic, or Asian infants. While typically described as disappearing by one year, many persist, sometimes into adulthood. They are seen most commonly on the buttocks and lower back, but may extend over the entire back and on extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77805\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77805 \">picture 2</a>). At first glance, they may be confused easily with fresh bruising, but Mongolian spots fade over months to years rather than days. The characteristic coloring and location of Mongolian spots and the absence of swelling or tenderness also help to differentiate them from bruising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Nevi and hemangiomas occasionally may create similar confusion, and are distinguished in a similar manner. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-skin-and-scalp-lesions-in-the-newborn-and-infant#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign skin and scalp lesions in the newborn and infant&quot;, section on 'Congenital dermal melanocytosis (Mongolian spot)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4166265492\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemangiomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemangiomas are congenital malformations of vascular tissue forming a benign tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60004\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60004 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50388\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50388 \">picture 4</a>). They are most commonly recognized under the surface of the skin, where their appearance depends on their depth. Hemangiomas have occasionally been mistaken for bruises and reported as child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Additionally, hemangiomas may rarely cause coagulopathy through consumption of platelets and circulating clotting factors in the Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-hemangiomas-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile hemangiomas: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-hemangiomas-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile hemangiomas: Evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2674748636\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed sub-aponeurotic fluid mass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sub-aponeurotic fluid mass is rare condition presenting as fluid filled masses on the scalp of infants, typically between 5 and 18 weeks of age. Medical providers may be unfamiliar with the condition, and as a result, 13 percent of parents described questioning about possible child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">FRACTURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of inflicted fractures includes accidental trauma, normal variants, pathologic fractures from metabolic bone disease or neoplasm, osteogenesis imperfecta, periosteal reaction from drugs or infection, cerebral palsy, and congenital insensitivity to pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the orthopedic manifestations of child abuse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder of collagen formation that results in &quot;brittle&quot; bones that are prone to repeated fracture, often with minimal trauma. Almost half of cases (46 percent) are diagnosed in the newborn period, and 7 percent may be diagnosed clinically, without resorting to laboratory testing. Family history of OI is only available 46 percent of the time. Approximately 10 percent have more than two fractures at the time of diagnosis, and multiple fractures in infancy are a very uncommon presentation for OI. Because OI is described as causing vulnerability to bruises, subdural hemorrhage and retinal hemorrhage as well, it is the prototype for diseases that may be confused with child abuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the orthopedic manifestations of child abuse&quot;, section on 'Osteogenesis imperfecta'</a>.)</p><p>Multiple other genetic disorders that create susceptibility to fracture have been described in the context of child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Most have unique clinical features that make them more easily distinguished from abuse fractures in healthy children. As with any other child with chronic disease, these patients can also be abused and the timing of presentation of the fracture and the pattern should be carefully compared to the history. </p><p>Nutritional deficiencies, such as rickets and copper deficiency, are both real and controversial medical causes of fracture. Children with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, who lack rachitic changes on radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81446\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81446 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F80989\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80989 \">image 2</a>), do not appear to be at risk for fracture. Cupped and frayed metaphyseal end plates, and loss of the sub-periosteal bone collar should prompt consideration for fragility fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Some authors have suggested that the presence of elevated intact parathyroid hormone should also prompt consideration of increasing bone fragility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the orthopedic manifestations of child abuse&quot;, section on 'Rickets'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the orthopedic manifestations of child abuse&quot;, section on 'Copper deficiency'</a>.)</p><p>Claims that Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) causes confusion with abuse fractures has become common in the courtroom. EDS is a common family of connective tissue and collagen disorders with highly variable presentation. Common forms of EDS produce easily bruised and injured skin, with a velvety texture, hyperdistensibility (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F107344\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107344 \">picture 5</a>), and unusual papyraceous scaring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F107345\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107345 \">picture 6</a>). Some forms of EDS create increased joint mobility that predisposes to orthopedic problems in older mobile children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F107346\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107346 \">picture 7</a>). Rarer forms of EDS cause fragility of large blood vessels and internal organs, and may present with internal injuries following relatively mild trauma. Such a situation might be expected to cause concern for child abuse. Other than an overlap form of EDS with OI, which demonstrates mutations in the Col 1A1 and Col 1A2 genes, EDS is not known to lead to fracture in infancy, and should not cause confusion related to possible child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The burn-like lesions are characterized by erythema and bullae, often in unusual patterns corresponding to the contact (streaks from dripping juice, handprints from adults handling the sensitizing material and then the child) or around the hands and mouth after the child handles or ingests the agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76127\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76127 \">picture 8</a>). The eruption typically appears hours to days after exposure, which can make the lesion more difficult to relate to the contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/8,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Complementary and alternative therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Garlic application to the skin of infants as a naturopathic remedy has been reported to cause bullae and partial thickness burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

Impetigo involves only the superficial layers of the skin; the lesions are flat, crusted, and heal cleanly. In contrast, cigarette burns penetrate more deeply (usually third-degree), have heaped-up margins, and heal with scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These disorders may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive fashion, or may be sporadic. Because of the lack of pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> temperature sensation, injuries and secondary infections are common occurrences. Injuries include bruises, burns, lacerations, fractures, and bite wounds (often self-inflicted because of the lack of pain, resulting in mutilation or amputation of the lips or fingertips). The wounds typically are undetected by caretakers because of the lack of complaint from the child. If the wounds remain open, they may become infected, leading to bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and other sequelae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Plain radiographs may demonstrate multiple fractures of varying ages, and residual deformities from undetected and unset fractures are common occurrences. Even fractures that are diagnosed and immobilized may heal poorly because of continued weight-bearing on the affected limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The fracture patterns may be similar to those seen in intentional injury. In contrast to the radiographic findings in the severe forms of OI, the bones are of normal density. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orthopedic aspects of child abuse&quot;, section on 'Fracture patterns'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of congenital insensitivity to pain can be made by taking a careful history and performing a thorough neurologic evaluation that includes pain and temperature testing. Sensory nerve conduction velocity is slowed or absent, and nerve biopsy may reveal a decrease in myelination or fewer unmyelinated fibers than normal. One type (Type 4, congenital insensitivity to pain and anhidrosis) involves recurrent unexplained episodes of hyperpyrexia in infancy caused by the absence of sweating. Anhidrosis may be secondary to the lack of innervation of the eccrine sweat glands.

They include cupping, coining, spooning, moxibustion, caida de mollera, and salting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Cupping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cupping, the air in an open-mouthed vessel is heated by various means, and then, the vessel is applied to the skin. The suction force created by the cooling and contracting of the heated air is thought to &quot;draw out&quot; the ailment. The heated air and the rim of the cup burn the skin.

Resuscitation itself, however, is a well-recognized cause of traumatic injury. As an example, in one observational study of 226 infants younger than one year of age who were resuscitated and died, external injuries on the face, neck, and chest were seen in 12 percent of patients (21 with abrasions and 6 with contusions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, fingernail abrasions, petechiae, or fingertip contusions were rare, regardless of whether resuscitation occurred or not. Contusions were more common in homicide (child abuse) victims. Posterior rib fractures from resuscitation can occur but are uncommon, occurring in up to 3 percent of young infants when the thumb-encircling technique is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and in &lt;0.5 percent of older infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18684687\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of suspected child abuse varies depending upon the clinical manifestations.

These patients may develop multiple different types of injuries. Specific clinical findings may include slow or absent sensory nerve conduction, absent myelin fibers around sensory nerves, hyperpyrexia, and absence of sweating.
