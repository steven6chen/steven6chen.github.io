When fully expressed, the manifestations include irregular menstrual cycles, hirsutism, obesity, insulin resistance, and anovulatory infertility.</p><p>The treatment of PCOS will be reviewed here. The epidemiology and pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, and clinical manifestations of PCOS are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and genetics of the polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have multiple abnormalities that require attention, including oligomenorrhea, hyperandrogenism, anovulatory infertility, and metabolic risk factors such as obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and impaired glucose tolerance. Weight loss, which can restore ovulatory cycles and improve metabolic risk, is the first-line intervention for most women. Our overall approach is similar to that described by the 2013 Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H794280451\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall goals of therapy of women with PCOS include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amelioration of hyperandrogenic symptoms (hirsutism, acne, scalp hair loss)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of underlying metabolic abnormalities and reduction of risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma, which may occur as a result of chronic anovulation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraception for those not pursuing pregnancy, as women with oligomenorrhea ovulate intermittently and unwanted pregnancy may occur </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovulation induction for those pursuing pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76807877\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest diet and exercise for weight reduction as the first step for overweight and obese women with PCOS. Available evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise, and behavioral interventions) are more effective than minimal treatment for weight loss and for improving insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, there appear to be reproductive benefits as well. (See <a href=\"#H70413157\" class=\"local\">'Weight reduction'</a> below and <a href=\"#H691428547\" class=\"local\">'Weight loss'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H794280459\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral contraceptives and risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral contraceptives (OCs) are the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy for women with PCOS for managing hyperandrogenism and menstrual dysfunction and for providing contraception. OCs are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in all users but particularly in obese women. There have been concerns that the presence of PCOS per se may represent an additional independent risk factor for VTE, but available data do not support this concept. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H342300742\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Venous thromboembolism'</a>.)</p><p>Our approach to the use of OCs in women with PCOS is the same as in women without PCOS. Risk factors for VTE including obesity, patient age, and family history of VTE should be assessed. We currently suggest using caution if OCs are prescribed to obese women (body mass index [BMI] &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> over age 40 years because these women are at particularly high risk for VTE. Other relative and absolute contraindications to OC use are outlined in the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/pdf/summary-chart-us-medical-eligibility-criteria_508tagged.pdf&amp;token=jEVGVo6WqsDq698K1C6vDPPjIqTfzg54vW4qWS3doblDMO+X3NN/ro6R0xwK/I6IOwBh6DyNhV/q6vrv3T8nCaRCrZsEC+Wz9FPYFmXFzWEhd9uzeVTKQGeWKf6mT23Z1X5qsRVoFq27I5l+8ZoObQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6964\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention United States Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use</a>. Alternatives to oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives include cyclic progestin therapy, continuous progestin therapy (progestin-only OCs [the &quot;minipill&quot;]), or a progestin-releasing intrauterine device (IUD). Cyclic progestin therapy can induce regular withdrawal uterine bleeding and reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. Both continuous progestin therapy (eg, a progestin-only OC such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> 0.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> and the progestin-releasing IUD provide contraception and reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.

However, there is no evidence that women with PCOS are at greater risk for either metabolic adverse effects or cardiovascular complications of OCs. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic effects of OCs in PCOS'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks and side effects associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H342300742\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Venous thromboembolism'</a>.)</p><p>Absence of pregnancy should be documented before OCs are begun. </p><p>An approach to starting OCs in women with PCOS is described below (see <a href=\"#H2412576634\" class=\"local\">'Choice of oral contraceptive'</a> below). Risks and side effects of OCs (including breakthrough bleeding) are similar to those for women without PCOS. Breakthrough bleeding and an overview of estrogen-progestin OCs are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks and side effects associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For women with PCOS who choose not to or cannot take OCs, alternative treatments for endometrial protection are intermittent or continuous progestin therapy, or a progestin-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In this setting, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (5 to 10 mg) for 10 to 14 days every one to two months. An alternative, but one that has been less well studied, is natural micronized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> 200 mg (given for the same duration every one to two months). Patients should be made aware that progestin therapy alone will not reduce the symptoms of acne or hirsutism, nor will it provide contraception. However, continuous progestin therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> 0.35 mg daily provides both contraception and endometrial protection. This is a progestin-only OC that is also referred to as the &quot;minipill.&quot; An alternative progestin option that provides both endometrial protection and contraception are the levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Candidates and device selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> is a potential alternative to restore menstrual cyclicity as it restores ovulatory menses in approximately 30 to 50 percent of women with PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Its ability to provide endometrial protection is less well established, and we therefore consider it to be second-line therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

In addition, the 2013 Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome also suggest OCs as first-line therapy for menstrual irregularities and hirsutism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An antiandrogen is then added after six months if the cosmetic response is suboptimal (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hirsutism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hirsutism&quot;</a>). OCs and an antiandrogen may sometimes be started simultaneously at the outset, particularly when the cutaneous manifestations are particularly bothersome to the patient. </p><p>For women with hirsutism and contraindications to OCs, we sometimes use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> alone, but an alternative form of contraception is essential because, if pregnancy occurs, an antiandrogen such as spironolactone could prevent development of normal external genitalia in a male fetus. Spironolactone alone does not regularize menstrual cycles, and in fact, is sometimes associated with menstrual irregularities. Therefore, in women using spironolactone as monotherapy for hyperandrogenism, progestin therapy is often needed. (See <a href=\"#H771175559\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial protection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hirsutism#H2273583496\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Antiandrogen therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2412576634\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of oral contraceptive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We typically start with an OC containing 20 mcg of ethinyl estradiol combined with a progestin with minimal androgenicity (such as norgestimate). Other progestins with minimal androgenicity or antiandrogenic properties include desogestrel and drospirenone, but both have been associated with a possible higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78782 \">table 1</a>). OCs containing one of the original progestins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> or norethindrone acetate, are also good options; while they are not as low in androgenicity, they have not been associated with excess VTE risk.

Although transdermal or vaginal ring preparations are potential options, they have not been well studied for the management of hirsutism and there are concerns about an excess risk of VTE with both regimens.
