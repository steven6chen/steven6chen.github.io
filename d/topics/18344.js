Incontinence is a very common problem, but it is not a normal part of aging. If you have urinary incontinence, you do not have to &quot;just live with it.&quot; There are treatments and things you can do on your own to stop or reduce urine leaks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12993448\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of urinary incontinence?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are different types of urinary incontinence. Each causes different symptoms. In men, the 4 main types are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress incontinence &ndash; Men with stress incontinence leak urine when they laugh, cough, sneeze, or do anything that &quot;stresses&quot; the belly. Some men get this type of incontinence after having surgery for prostate disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urgency incontinence &ndash; Men with urgency incontinence feel a strong need to urinate all of a sudden. Urgency incontinence is also known as urge incontinence. Often the &quot;urge&quot; is so strong that they can't make it to the bathroom in time. (If you have these sudden urges but do not leak urine, you might have an &quot;overactive bladder.&quot; That can also be treated.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed incontinence &ndash; Men with mixed incontinence have symptoms of both stress and urgency incontinence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incontinence caused by incomplete bladder emptying &ndash; Some men cannot fully empty their bladder when they urinate. This can happen if they have a condition called &quot;benign prostatic hyperplasia,&quot; which makes the prostate grow larger than normal. An enlarged prostate can block the flow of urine.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12993463\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Here are some steps that can help reduce urine leaks:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you drink lots of liquids, ask your doctor or nurse if it is okay for you to reduce the amount you drink. This might help, especially in the hours before you go to bed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cut down on any foods or drinks that make your symptoms worse. Some people find that alcohol, caffeine, or spicy or acidic foods irritate the bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight, if you are overweight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you take medicines called diuretics, keep in mind that these medicines increase the need to urinate. Try to plan ahead and take them when you know you will be near a bathroom for a few hours. If you keep having problems with leaking because of diuretics, ask your doctor if you can take a lower dose or switch to a different medicine.</p><p/><p>These techniques can also help with bladder control:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder retraining &ndash; During bladder retraining, you &quot;train&quot; yourself to go to the bathroom at scheduled times, even if you do not feel like you have to go. For instance, you might decide that you will go every hour while you are awake. In that case, you would go to the bathroom every hour, even if you don't feel the need to go. You would also try to wait until a whole hour had passed even if you need to go sooner. Once you get used to this, you try to increase the time between bathroom trips to an hour and 15 minutes. Over time, you might be able to &quot;retrain&quot; your bladder to wait up to 3 or 4 hours between bathroom visits. When you reach 3 or 4 hours, you can stop bladder training.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic muscle exercises &ndash; Pelvic muscle exercises strengthen the muscles that control the flow of urine. When done right, these exercises can help. But people often do them wrong. Ask your doctor or nurse how to do them right.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12993480\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can find out what might be causing your incontinence. He or she can also suggest ways to help the problem.</p><p>Ask your doctor or nurse if any of the medicines you take could be causing your symptoms. Some medicines can cause incontinence or make symptoms worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12993495\"><span class=\"h1\">How is incontinence treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your treatment options depend on what type of incontinence you have. Some of the treatment options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to relax the bladder &ndash; These medicines can help with urgency incontinence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to improve urine flow &ndash; These medicines can help with incontinence related to an enlarged prostate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F116995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116995 \">figure 1</a>): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Repair the tissues that support the bladder or hold it in place</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Improve the flow of urine, for example by removing part of the prostate gland</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Repair the muscles that control urine flow</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrical stimulation of the nerves that relax the bladder</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devices, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A &quot;condom catheter,&quot; which fits over the penis like a condom and collects urine into a bag that is strapped to the leg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A penis clamp, which squeezes the penis to keep urine from leaking out (this can be used only for a certain amount of time).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12993510\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many men with incontinence can recover bladder control or at least reduce the amount of leakage they have. The key is to speak up about it to your doctor or nurse. Then work with him or her to find a treatment or therapy that helps you. Sometimes it takes a few tries before you find a solution, but the effort is worth it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12993525\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-enlarged-prostate-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-muscle-kegel-exercises-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pelvic muscle (Kegel) exercises (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgery-to-treat-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Surgery to treat stress urinary incontinence in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-urgency-incontinence-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Treatments for urgency incontinence in women (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-bph-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-treatments-for-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence treatments for women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-floor-muscle-exercises-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
