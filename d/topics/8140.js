Hepatitis simply means &quot;inflammation of the liver&quot; (the suffix &quot;itis&quot; means inflammation and &quot;hepa&quot; means liver). Hepatitis B is a specific type of hepatitis that is caused by a virus.</p><p>It is estimated that there are more than 250 million carriers of the hepatitis B virus in the world, with over 500,000 dying annually from hepatitis B-related liver disease.</p><p>Fortunately, several medications are available for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, and hepatitis B infection can be prevented by vaccination. Hepatitis B vaccines are safe and highly effective in preventing hepatitis B infection and are now given routinely to newborns and children in the United States and in many other countries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More detailed information about hepatitis B is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW DID I BECOME INFECTED WITH HEPATITIS B?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several ways to become infected with hepatitis B virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Contaminated needles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Using contaminated needles can spread the hepatitis B virus. This includes tattooing, acupuncture, and ear piercing (if these procedures are performed with contaminated instruments). Sharing needles or syringes can also spread the virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual contact with someone who is infected is one of the most common ways to become infected with hepatitis B. If you are infected with hepatitis B, make sure your spouse or sex partner gets vaccinated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mother to infant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis B can be passed from a mother to her baby during or shortly after delivery. Having a Cesarean delivery (also called a C-section) does not prevent the virus from spreading. Experts believe that breastfeeding is safe.</p><p>To help prevent transmission from mother to infant, all pregnant women should have a blood test for a marker of hepatitis B virus, called hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Normally, the HBsAg should be negative. If the mother is HBsAg-positive, she should be referred to a specialist. (See <a href=\"#H634022475\" class=\"local\">'Preventing infection from mother to child'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Close contact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis B can be spread through close personal contact. This could happen if blood or other bodily fluids get into tiny cracks or breaks in your skin or in your mouth or eyes. The virus can live for a long time away from the body, meaning that it can be spread by sharing household items like toys, toothbrushes, or razors. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Preventing infection of close contacts'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood transfusion and organ transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nowadays, it is extremely rare for hepatitis B to be spread through blood transfusion or organ transplantation. Blood and organ donors are carefully screened for markers of hepatitis infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donation-and-transfusion-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Blood donation and transfusion (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">In the hospital</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the hospital, hepatitis B virus can spread from one patient to another or from a patient to a doctor or nurse if there is an accidental needle stick. It is rare for a <span class=\"nowrap\">doctor/nurse</span> to pass hepatitis B to a patient. Wearing gloves, eye protection, a face mask, and washing hands can help to prevent spreading the virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS B SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms due to hepatitis B vary. After a person is first infected with hepatitis B, they can develop a flu-like illness that includes fever, abdominal pain, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, and in some cases yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). In the most severe cases, liver failure can develop, which is characterized by jaundice, fluid accumulation (swelling in the legs or abdomen), and confusion. However, many patients do not develop symptoms, particularly if the infection occurs in infants and children. Not having symptoms does not necessarily mean that the infection is under control. Most people with chronic hepatitis B have no symptoms until their liver disease is at a late stage. The most common early symptom is feeling tired. Everyone with chronic hepatitis B is at increased risk of developing complications, including liver scarring (called cirrhosis when the scarring is severe) and liver cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cirrhosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute hepatitis B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a person is first infected with hepatitis B, they are said to have acute hepatitis. Most people with acute hepatitis B recover uneventfully.</p><p>However, in about 5 percent of adults (1 in 20) the virus makes itself at home in the liver, where it continues to make copies of itself for many years. People who continue to harbor the virus are referred to as &quot;carriers&quot;. If liver damage develops because of longstanding infection, the person is said to have chronic hepatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic hepatitis B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic hepatitis B develops more commonly in people who are infected with the virus at an early age (often at birth). Unfortunately, this is common in some parts of the world such as in Southeast Asia, China, and sub-Saharan Africa, where as many as 1 in 10 people have chronic hepatitis B infection.</p><p>Many people with chronic hepatitis B have no symptoms at all; other people have symptoms of ongoing liver inflammation, such as fatigue and loss of appetite.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS B DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of tests that can be used to diagnose or monitor hepatitis B infection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a>). Most of these tests are blood tests and include those that detect: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B surface antigen (abbreviated HBsAg) &ndash; HBsAg is a protein on the surface of the hepatitis B virus. This protein shows up in the blood 1 to 10 weeks after exposure to the hepatitis B virus and before a person starts to show symptoms of the infection. In people who recover, this protein usually disappears after 4 to 6 months. Its continued presence suggests that chronic infection has developed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B surface antibody (abbreviated anti-HBs) &ndash; Anti-HBs helps the body's immune system attack the hepatitis B virus. This protein is usually present in people who have recovered or who have been vaccinated against hepatitis B. People with this protein are usually immune to hepatitis B.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B core antibody (abbreviated anti-HBc) &ndash; Anti-HBc is usually present throughout the course of infection and stays in the blood after recovery. It is not present in people who have been vaccinated against hepatitis B.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B e antigen (abbreviated HBeAg) &ndash; HBeAg is a protein whose presence indicates that the hepatitis B virus is continuing to make copies of itself (replicating). Its presence usually indicates a high level of circulating virus and a high chance of transmission of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B e antibody (abbreviated anti-HBe) &ndash; Anti-HBe usually signifies that virus replication has slowed down, but in some variants of hepatitis B, the virus continues to replicate at a rapid rate, and high levels of virus can be found in the circulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B DNA (abbreviated HBV DNA) &ndash; HBV DNA is the genetic material found in the hepatitis B virus. HBV DNA usually disappears from the blood after a person recovers. HBV DNA (viral load) is a measure of the concentration of virus in the circulating blood. Doctors use the levels of HBV DNA to decide who is a candidate for treatment with antiviral medicines and to track how well treatment is working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other tests &ndash; There are many other tests that can reflect the health of the liver, but are not specific for hepatitis B. These include liver enzyme tests (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and platelet count. As an example, an abnormally high ALT in the blood can be due to liver damage. Although liver damage can be caused by a virus (such as hepatitis B virus), it can also be caused by alcohol, drugs, fat accumulation in the liver (&quot;fatty liver&quot;), or other diseases.</p><p/><p>A liver biopsy (in which a needle is inserted into the liver to remove a small piece of tissue for testing) is not routinely needed to diagnose hepatitis B virus infection. A liver biopsy is used to monitor liver damage in people with chronic hepatitis, help decide if treatment is needed, and find signs of cirrhosis or liver cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-biopsy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Liver biopsy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The severity of liver disease or degree of liver damage can also be determined by other methods, without the need for liver biopsy. This may involve blood tests or tests to measure liver stiffness. In general, these tests are accurate in being able to tell early fibrosis (scarring) from advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (when the scar tissue is severe). However, they cannot determine specific stages of fibrosis or determine the degree of inflammation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">WILL I DEVELOP CHRONIC HEPATITIS B?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The likelihood of developing chronic hepatitis B largely depends on your age at the time of infection. Chronic infection develops in about 90 percent of children who are infected at birth, in 20 to 50 percent of children who are infected between the ages of 1 and 5 years, and in less than 5 percent of people infected with hepatitis B during adulthood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3964287127\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS THE RISK OF ME HAVING CIRRHOSIS OR LIVER CANCER?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of developing complications (such as cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer) depends on how rapidly the virus multiplies and how well your immune system controls the infection. </p><p>For patients with chronic hepatitis B, the risk of developing complications is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher in men than in women, and with increasing age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased by drinking alcohol, having chronic hepatitis C or D (a virus that is dependent on hepatitis B), or having HIV infection (the virus that causes AIDS).</p><p/><p>In addition, being overweight or having diabetes increases the risk of having fatty liver (fat accumulation in the liver), which can increase the rate of liver disease progression in people with hepatitis B.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS B TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1943415877\"><span class=\"h2\">Should everyone be treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific treatment for acute hepatitis B is usually not needed since in about 95 percent of adults, the immune system controls the infection and gets rid of the virus within about six months.</p><p>In people who develop chronic hepatitis, an antiviral medication might be recommended to reduce or reverse liver damage and to prevent long-term complications of hepatitis B. However, not all people with hepatitis B need immediate treatment. If you do not need to start treatment immediately, you will be monitored over time to know when hepatitis becomes more active (at that point you may begin antiviral treatment).</p><p>Once you start treatment, you will have regular blood tests to see how well the treatment is working and to detect side effects or drug resistance. Monitoring will continue after finishing treatment to determine if the infection has come back. Treatment should not be stopped without discussing this with your doctor because, in some cases, the virus can come back quickly, causing severe liver injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2261332798\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your doctor thinks you should be treated, there are two types of antiviral medications that can be used, nucleos(t)ide analogues (these are oral medications that you take daily) and interferon (an injectable medication). Most patients receive an oral medication; however, your doctor will discuss these choices with you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4227236582\"><span class=\"h3\">Nucleos(t)ide analogues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nucleos(t)ide analogues are oral medications that can be used to treat hepatitis B. Most patients will need long-term treatment to maintain control of the hepatitis B virus. For some patients, lifelong therapy is needed. Entecavir and tenofovir are the most commonly used oral agents. These antiviral medications are more potent and are less likely to cause the virus to develop resistance compared with other nucleos(t)ide analogues, such as lamivudine, adefovir, and telbivudine. (See <a href=\"#H1675291798\" class=\"local\">'Entecavir'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1617791772\" class=\"local\">'Tenofovir'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1837879147\" class=\"local\">'Other agents'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1675291798\"><span class=\"h4\">Entecavir</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Entecavir (brand name: Baraclude) is a recommended treatment for patients who have not been treated with oral antivirals before. Although resistance to entecavir is uncommon in people who have never received antiviral therapy, it can occur in up to 50 percent of people who have used lamivudine for treatment of hepatitis B. (See <a href=\"#H1837879147\" class=\"local\">'Other agents'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-in-the-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Entecavir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1617791772\"><span class=\"h4\">Tenofovir</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tenofovir is a recommended treatment for both patients who have been and those who have never been treated with oral antivirals for hepatitis B. Tenofovir is available in two formulations: tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (brand name: Viread) and tenofovir alafenamide (brand name: Vemlidy). For most patients, tenofovir alafenamide is preferred, if it is available. </p><p>Tenofovir is effective in suppressing hepatitis B virus that is resistant to other antiviral agents, such as lamivudine, telbivudine, or entecavir. It is also effective when used to treat patients who have a form of the virus that is resistant to adefovir; however, there may be a slower decline in hepatitis B virus levels when certain adefovir resistance mutations are present. Resistance to tenofovir has not been reported. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-and-adefovir-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-hbv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tenofovir and adefovir for the treatment of chronic HBV infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1837879147\"><span class=\"h4\">Other agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several nucleos(t)ide medications are no longer recommended for the treatment of chronic HBV in most countries. These include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lamivudine &ndash; Lamivudine (sample brand names: Epivir-HBV, Zeffix) is effective in decreasing hepatitis B virus activity and ongoing liver inflammation. It is safe in patients with liver failure, and long-term treatment can decrease the risk of liver failure and liver cancer. However, a resistant form of hepatitis B virus (referred to as a &quot;YMDD mutant&quot;) frequently develops in people who take lamivudine long term. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adefovir &ndash; Adefovir (brand name: Hepsera) is another oral medication for people who have detectable hepatitis B virus activity and ongoing liver inflammation. Adefovir is a weak antiviral medicine and resistance is more common than with entecavir or tenofovir. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telbivudine &ndash; Telbivudine (brand name: Tyzeka) is more potent than lamivudine and adefovir. However, resistance to telbivudine is common, and hepatitis B virus that is resistant to lamivudine is also resistant to telbivudine. This antiviral medication is no longer manufactured in the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Interferon-alfa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interferon-alfa is an appropriate treatment for people with chronic hepatitis B infection who have detectable virus activity, ongoing liver inflammation, and no cirrhosis. Both conventional interferon and pegylated interferon are approved in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard and pegylated interferon for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Interferon-alfa may be considered in young patients who do not have advanced liver disease and do not wish to be on long-term treatment. Interferon-alfa is not appropriate for people with cirrhosis who have liver failure or for people who have a recurrence of hepatitis after liver transplantation.</p><p>Interferon is given for a finite duration. Pegylated interferon, a long acting interferon taken once a week, is given for one year. This is in contrast to the other hepatitis treatments, which are given by mouth for many years until a desired response is achieved. Drug resistance to interferon has not been reported.</p><p>The disadvantages of interferon-alfa are that it must be taken by injection and it can cause many side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver transplantation may be the only option for people who have developed advanced cirrhosis. The liver transplantation process is elaborate, involving an extensive screening process to ensure that a person is a good candidate. Thus, not all patients with cirrhosis are eligible, and only those with the most advanced cirrhosis or early stage liver cancer and otherwise good medical and social conditions will be put on the transplant waiting list. Because of the shortage of donors, not all patients on the transplant waiting list will receive a liver transplant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">TIPS TO MAINTAIN LIVER HEALTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, the majority of people with acute hepatitis B spontaneously clear the infection. Those who develop chronic infection should see a doctor with expertise in liver disease (usually a gastroenterologist or hepatologist) who can discuss treatment options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Everyone with chronic hepatitis B should be vaccinated against hepatitis A unless they are known to be immune. Influenza vaccination is recommended once per year, usually in the fall. Patients with liver disease should also receive standard immunizations, including a diphtheria and tetanus booster, every ten years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver cancer screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regular screening for liver cancer is also recommended, particularly for older individuals, those with cirrhosis, and patients with a family history of liver cancer. In general, this includes an ultrasound examination of the liver every six months. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No specific diet has been shown to improve the outcome in people with hepatitis B. The best advice is to eat a normal healthy and balanced diet and to maintain a normal weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol should be avoided since it can worsen liver damage. All types of alcoholic beverages can be harmful to the liver. People with hepatitis B can develop liver complications even with small amounts of alcohol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise is good for overall health and is encouraged, but it has no effect on the hepatitis B virus. Exercise is not harmful to the liver, even in people with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Prescription and nonprescription drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many medications are broken down by the liver. Thus, it is always best to check with a healthcare provider or pharmacist before starting a new medication. As a general rule, unless the liver is already scarred, most drugs are safe for people with hepatitis B.</p><p>An important possible exception is acetaminophen (Tylenol&reg;); the maximum recommended dose in people with liver disease is no more than 2 grams (2000 mg or four extra strength tabs or capsules) in 24 hours. Most acetaminophen tabs or capsules contain 325 or 500 mg. Many over-the-counter cold and headache medicines under different names may contain acetaminophen.</p><p>You should avoid ibuprofen (sold as Advil, Motrin, and store brands), naproxen (sold as Aleve and store brands), and aspirin (sold as Bufferin, Excedrin, and store brands) if you have cirrhosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Herbal medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No herbal treatment has been proven to improve outcomes in patients with hepatitis B, and some can cause serious liver toxicity. Herbal treatments are not recommended for anyone with hepatitis B.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sharing concerns with others infected with hepatitis B can provide support. A number of organizations are available around the world. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Where to get more information'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H634022468\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventing infection of close contacts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute and chronic hepatitis B are contagious. Thus, people with hepatitis B should discuss measures to reduce the risk of infecting close contacts. This includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss the infection with any sexual partners and use a latex condom with every sexual encounter.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not share razors, toothbrushes, or anything that has blood on it.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cover open sores and cuts with a bandage.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not donate blood, body organs, other tissues, or sperm.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate family and household members should be tested for hepatitis B. Anyone who is at risk of hepatitis B infection should be vaccinated.

These include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiviral medications may be recommended for the mother if the amount of virus in her blood (viral load) is high. These medications are used to decrease the viral load. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants should be given a shot soon after birth called hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG). HBIG provides immediate protection to the infant, but the effect only lasts a few months. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants should also receive the hepatitis B vaccine series. The first dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be given at birth. Two other doses can be administered along with their regular childhood immunizations at approximately 1 and 6 months of age.
