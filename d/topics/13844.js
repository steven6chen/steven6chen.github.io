Sometimes it also causes swelling in joints such as the knees, hands, and feet. It usually occurs in people age 50 and older.</p><p>Giant cell arteritis is a condition that can cause headaches, trouble seeing, and jaw or arm pain. This condition affects blood vessels, usually in the head and sometimes in the neck. Blood vessels in the brain are <strong>not</strong> affected. Giant cell arteritis is sometimes called &quot;temporal arteritis&quot; because it often affects a blood vessel in the temple on the side of the head.</p><p>Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis are two different conditions. But they sometimes occur together. Usually, these conditions last between 1 and 3 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H561015499\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain and stiffness in the shoulders, hips, neck, or upper part of the body that is usually worse in the morning &ndash; These symptoms occur on both sides of the body and last 30 minutes or longer after getting up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling and stiffness in the knees, hands, wrists, ankles, or feet</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p>The most common symptoms of giant cell arteritis are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches &ndash; The pain is often over the temples (sides of the forehead) but can also be in the front or back of the head.

If your doctor or nurse suspects that you have polymyalgia rheumatica or giant cell arteritis, he or she will do an exam and order blood tests. He or she might also order an X-ray, MRI, or other imaging test. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of your body.</p><p>To check for giant cell arteritis, your doctor might order a test called a biopsy. During a biopsy, a doctor takes a small piece of a blood vessel from under your skin on the side of the head. He or she then looks at the tissue under a microscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H561015513\"><span class=\"h1\">How are polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis are treated with medicines called steroids. (These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. These steroids reduce swelling and ease pain.) Many people feel better after taking their first dose. But most people need to take steroids for 1 to 2 years.</p><p>Steroids can have side effects, so your doctor will want to make sure you are on the lowest dose possible for the shortest amount of time possible.</p><p>Doctors might also prescribe other types of medicines for people with giant cell arteritis. For example, most people with giant cell arteritis also take a low dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> every day to prevent vision loss or a stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H561015520\"><span class=\"h1\">What else can I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about treatment and follow-up. For example, if you have giant cell arteritis, your doctor might order a test called a chest X-ray every year to check the blood vessels in your chest.</p><p>It's also important to let your doctor know if you have side effects from the treatment or if you develop new symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H561015527\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vasculitis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyalgia-rheumatica-and-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell (temporal) arteritis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
