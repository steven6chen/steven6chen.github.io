It is caused by loss of part or all of an X chromosome.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome will be reviewed below. Management of Turner syndrome is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-turner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Turner syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Turner syndrome was first reported as a clinical syndrome (prior to the availability of karyotyping) in seven women with short stature, sexual immaturity, neck webbing, and cubitus valgus in a paper published in 1938 by Henri Turner, an Oklahoma physician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, Otto Ulrich had already described an eight-year-old girl with a similar phenotype several years earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Turner syndrome is one of the most common sex chromosome abnormalities in females and occurs in approximately 1 in 2000 to 1 in 2500 live female births, based on epidemiological and newborn genetic screening data from Europe, Japan, and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The true prevalence of Turner syndrome remains difficult to ascertain because patients with a mild phenotype may remain undiagnosed, and some patients are not diagnosed until adulthood if the phenotype is mild [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Turner syndrome occurs with more or less the same prevalence in all ethnic groups and in different countries. However, the prevalence at birth may be declining in some countries. This may be related to the increased use of ultrasonographic screening prenatally and the fact that some mothers carrying fetuses with Turner syndrome choose to terminate the pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. On the other hand, most gestations (likely more than 99 percent) affected by X chromosome monosomy (45,X) do not survive to birth, and the 45,X genotype is found in at least 10 percent of spontaneous abortions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Turner syndrome is a sex chromosome disorder caused by loss of part or all of an X chromosome. Types of chromosomal anomalies associated with Turner syndrome are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F107240\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107240 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>45,X</strong> &ndash; 45,X (monosomy X) is found in approximately 45 percent of live births with Turner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The X chromosome is derived from the mother in two-thirds of patients with Turner syndrome and from the father in the remaining one-third [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>45,X mosaicism</strong> &ndash; Approximately one-half of all patients with Turner syndrome have a mosaic chromosomal complement (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XX</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/47,XXX,</span> or 45,X mosaics with the X chromosome anomalies listed below); this cell line mosaicism results from sex chromosome nondisjunction occurring during postzygotic cell division [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Presence and degree of mosaicism may differ among different tissues. Absence of mosaicism in a karyotype from a peripheral blood sample does not universally preclude mosaicism in other tissues. Mosaicism with a normal cell line in the fetal membranes may protect placental function and enhance fetal survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, the clinical phenotype of girls with mosaicism for a normal cell line is often milder compared with that seen in 45,X patients, although this depends on which tissues are affected by the mosaicism and on the developmental timing of the mosaicism. Low degrees of mosaicism can also be found in phenotypically normal females.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>X chromosome anomalies</strong> &ndash; Several types of anomalies in the X chromosome can cause Turner syndrome, with or without mosaicism:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Isochromosome Xq</strong> (46,X,i(X)q) &ndash; This is a structurally abnormal X chromosome, consisting of two copies of the long arm of the X chromosome connected head-to-head, with some intervening centromeric or short arm chromosome material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with 46,X,i(X)q) are, by definition, monosomic for the short arm of the X chromosome. They are also believed to be at a higher risk for autoimmune disorders such as thyroiditis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Ring chromosome X</strong> (rX) &ndash; A ring chromosome X (rX) may form if part of the end of both the short and long arms of the X chromosome are missing; this anomaly is functionally similar to a deletion of the distal part of the short arm (Xp deletion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. If the X-inactivation site XIST is also missing, the risk for significant developmental delay is substantially increased and the patient may also have physical features that are not typical for Turner syndrome per se (early severe growth failure, atypical facial dysmorphisms, and syndactyly) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2971475066\" class=\"local\">'Psychologic and educational issues'</a> below.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Xp or Xq deletion</strong> &ndash; Some patients have a deletion of a portion of the short arm of the X chromosome [del(X)p] with or without 45,X cell line mosaicism, while others have <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,X,del(X)q</span> mosaicism. If a patient only has cells with a terminal Xq deletion, she may only have ovarian insufficiency but no other features of Turner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turner syndrome with <strong>Y-chromosome mosaicism</strong> &ndash; Approximately 10 to 12 percent of all individuals with a Turner syndrome phenotype may have mosaicism involving a cell line containing Y chromosome material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These patients may be identified if marker chromosome elements (sex chromosome material of uncertain origin) are detected on the karyotype or if they present with virilization. In such patients, it is important to perform further testing to determine whether Y chromosome material is present because of the increased risk of gonadoblastoma. A <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XY</span> karyotype has been associated with a variety of phenotypes, ranging from the typical phenotype of Turner syndrome, to an ovotesticular disorder of sex development with genital ambiguity, to a normal male phenotype with infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H623378723\" class=\"local\">'Y chromosome mosaicism'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The tips of the short arms of the X and Y chromosomes are logical sites for Turner syndrome-related genes as sex chromosomes undergo meiotic recombination within the pseudo-autosomal region and normally escape X inactivation. Some of the phenotypic characteristics of Turner syndrome have been localized to specific genes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For short stature, the homeobox gene, <em>SHOX</em> (short stature homeobox-containing gene on the X chromosome), is associated with short stature in Turner syndrome and in Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis and also in up to 15 percent of cases of idiopathic short stature, depending on the patient cohorts studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>]. Short stature is the only clinical finding invariably associated with the 45,X karyotype; it also is the only phenotypic abnormality present in virtually 100 percent of patients with Turner syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For gonadal insufficiency, a gene for bone morphogenetic protein 15 (<em>BMP15</em>) on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp), as well as two genes encoding fragile X mental retardation protein or FMRP (<em>FMR1</em> and <em>FMR2</em>), on the long arm (Xq) have been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and causes of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;</a>). Accordingly, deletions of the long arm of the X chromosome have been reported in otherwise normal women (ie, with normal stature) with secondary amenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For hypothyroidism and cardiac defects, correlations with specific karyotypic abnormalities suggest loci on the short arm of the X chromosome, but these phenotypes have not yet been linked to specific genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune disorders'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Other mechanisms also play a role in the development of Turner syndrome phenotypes. The phenomenon of <strong>imprinting</strong> may play an important role, as suggested by the differences that exist between individuals with maternally derived X chromosome material compared with those with paternally derived X chromosome material. For example, a study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected that prepubertal brain volume is correlated with the dose of maternal X chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Imprinting may explain some of the differences between 45,X females and 46,XX females. A <strong>mechanical effect</strong> from fetal lymphedema during organ development is thought to contribute to development of the webbing of the neck, shield chest, and probably the ear malformations, renal anomalies, and certain cardiac defects, but the specific genetic mechanism for the development of severe lymphedema remains to be elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most consistent characteristic of girls and women with Turner syndrome is their short stature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60006\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60006 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91041\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91041 \">picture 1</a>). Other anomalies include a &quot;shield&quot; chest with widely spaced nipples, a short and webbed neck, cubitus valgus, and Madelung deformity of the forearm and wrist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94419 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94420\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94420 \">image 1</a>). The shield chest and short stature sometimes gives a disproportionately broad or stocky appearance. Neonates may have congenital lymphedema of the hands and feet, webbed neck, nail dysplasia, narrow and high-arched palate, and short fourth metacarpals <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metatarsals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Hearing loss, hypothyroidism, and liver function abnormalities often occur as these girls get older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Liver enzymes are mildly elevated in approximately 35 to 45 percent of adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>] and improve with <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progestin</span> hormone therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Intelligence is usually within the normal range, but patients may have specific neurocognitive deficits, eg, problems with visuospatial organization or a nonverbal learning disorder. (See <a href=\"#H2971475066\" class=\"local\">'Psychologic and educational issues'</a> below.)</p><p>Other manifestations include increased risk of autoimmune diseases (including autoimmune thyroiditis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] and specific morphologic defects of facial development and cardiovascular, urologic, and bone structure, as detailed in the following sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/40,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,45,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H889322058\"><span class=\"h2\">Short stature and skeletal anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short stature combined with a stocky or square appearance is the most common clinical feature of Turner syndrome. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-human-growth-hormone-somatropin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Recombinant human growth hormone</a> therapy is recommended to optimize adult height, and prompt recognition and diagnosis of Turner syndrome is important to provide optimal benefits from growth hormone. For monitoring growth, the height of patients with Turner syndrome should be plotted on growth curves specific for this disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75558 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-turner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Turner syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If left untreated, the adult height in Turner syndrome is approximately 20 cm below that of the general female population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Adult height is correlated with parental stature, as it is in the general population, but the height is significantly less than would be predicted for a girl without Turner syndrome. The short stature is secondary to abnormal growth patterns throughout life. The stocky appearance is a consequence of relatively greater reduction in body height than width and because many girls are overweight. Girls with Turner syndrome are often born with a mild degree of growth retardation. Linear growth remains slow during infancy and throughout childhood. The growth failure is further compounded by delayed puberty, with lack of a growth spurt. Unfortunately, many girls, in spite of their short stature, are not diagnosed until after age 8 to 10 years, which is too late to derive full benefits from treatment with growth hormone. For individuals with Turner syndrome who are not diagnosed during infancy, the average delay of diagnosis in the United States is approximately five years after the patient falls below the fifth percentile for height. When assessing the growth of any girl with short stature, the provider should compare that girl's height percentile not only with the general female population, but also with the expected target height percentile based on the parental heights. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature#H523440\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of growth'</a>.)</p><p>Scoliosis develops in approximately 20 percent of patients and kyphosis in nearly 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A number of developmental abnormalities of the skeleton result in additional findings that are characteristic of Turner syndrome, including short neck (hypoplasia of the neck vertebrae), Madelung deformity (bayonet deformity) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94419 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94420\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94420 \">image 1</a>), cubitus valgus (increased carrying angles; present in approximately 50 percent of individuals with Turner syndrome) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F107185\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107185 \">figure 2</a>), genu valgum (knock-knee) or varum (bowleggedness), and short fourth metacarpal (knuckle) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metatarsal bones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary hypogonadism (gonadal dysgenesis) is one of the most common features of Turner syndrome, and Turner syndrome is one of the most common causes of premature ovarian failure. Most affected women have no breast development and have primary amenorrhea. Approximately 15 to 30 percent of women with Turner syndrome either have initial breast development followed by pubertal arrest, or complete puberty but then develop secondary amenorrhea. A small percentage of women have normal pubertal development and regular menstruation. These milder phenotypes of ovarian failure are more common in girls with mosaicism compared with those with a 45,X genotype. Although the onset of adrenarche is normal in many girls with Turner syndrome, an earlier onset of adrenarche, but followed by delayed pubarche, can be observed in those girls who have already developed primary ovarian failure in late childhood. This is an indication that the timing of adrenarche and pubarche in girls is dependent on normally functioning ovaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and causes of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because of the ovarian failure, many girls with Turner syndrome have elevated serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In some cases, the elevated FSH is discovered before the diagnosis of Turner syndrome is made (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-primary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of primary amenorrhea&quot;</a>). However, it is important to note that a normal FSH does not exclude the possibility of Turner syndrome. Measurement of anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) may be more sensitive as a marker of pending ovarian failure than FSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-turner-syndrome#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Turner syndrome&quot;, section on 'Management of ovarian failure'</a>.)</p><p>Although normal menarche is uncommon in women with Turner syndrome, the possibility of Turner syndrome should still be considered in any girl with unexplained short stature, even if she went through puberty and is having menstrual cycles. As an example, a retrospective study of 522 patients with Turner syndrome who were over the age of 12 years found that 84 (16 percent) had spontaneous menarche at an average age of 13.2 years; 30 of these women still had regular menses nine years after menarche, and three became pregnant without medical assistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In a second retrospective study of 276 adults with cytogenetically proven Turner syndrome, five women had spontaneous puberty and spontaneous pregnancies, despite high-grade monosomy (45,X in &ge;90 percent of a 50-cell karyotype) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The ovaries in Turner syndrome characteristically consist of small amounts of connective tissue and no follicles or only a few atretic follicles (&quot;streak gonads&quot;). However, the degree of ovarian dysfunction is variable, ranging (at the extremes) from no ovarian function to completely normal with normal menarche and normal reproductive function for at least a few years after menarche. Careful histologic studies of the ovaries of eight aborted 45,X fetuses are the basis of our understanding of the gonadal failure in Turner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. These ovaries contained apparently normal numbers of primordial germ cells for up to at least six weeks of gestation, but at later gestational ages, the numbers of germ cells were decreased and connective tissue was increased compared with age-matched normal fetuses. These results indicate that the gonadal dysgenesis may be caused by accelerated apoptosis rather than abnormal germ cell formation. The underlying mechanisms for this increased rate of loss of oocytes are yet to be determined, but haploinsufficiency of genes on the X chromosome likely leads to decreased oocyte survival (ie, two copies of these gene[s] are necessary for normal oocyte survival).</p><p>The spectrum of ovarian pathology in Turner syndrome is illustrated by a study that evaluated 104 girls aged 0.2 to 17.4 years with complete or partial X chromosome deletions using pelvic ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Approximately one-third had visible, non-streak ovaries. The girls with visible ovaries had apparently normal ovarian growth and follicular development up to the time of puberty and were more likely to have spontaneous breast development and uterine growth, indicating some ovarian function; many, but not all, of these girls had incomplete X chromosome deletions. These findings are consistent with several case reports of adult women with both 45,X and partial X chromosome deletions who conceived and bore children before developing secondary amenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. The incidence of 45,X and <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XX</span> mosaic karyotypes in women with normal fertility is unknown.</p><p>Because of the broad range of gonadal function, it is not easy to predict which girls will have absence of breast development versus those girls who will have spontaneous thelarche or even menarche. Emerging evidence suggests that measurement of AMH is a sensitive marker of prepubertal follicular development and will be helpful in the ovarian assessment of Turner syndrome throughout childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Specific imaging of the ovaries (eg, by ultrasound) is often not useful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-turner-syndrome#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Turner syndrome&quot;, section on 'Management of ovarian failure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular disease presents the most serious health problem for women with Turner syndrome and substantially contributes to the increased mortality rates for affected individuals. The morbidity and mortality are due to increased risks for cardiovascular malformations, compounded by renal abnormalities and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>], leading to increased risk for aortic dilatation and dissection. The presence of neck webbing and increased thoracic anterior-to-posterior diameters are useful predictors for cardiovascular abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/35,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,60</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of cardiovascular malformations in patients with Turner syndrome varies across studies and depends on whether diagnosis is made with echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cardiac MRI is generally more sensitive than echocardiography for detecting cardiovascular defects, especially for valvular disease, but also for systemic or pulmonary venous abnormalities, or for abnormally elongated transverse aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Estrogen deficiency is a contributor to this risk, and estrogen therapy improves cardiovascular risk factors (lipid profile and aortic stiffness).

Several factors probably contribute to these findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Suboptimal estrogen replacement</strong> &ndash; The importance of this factor is suggested by some studies that report normal bone density in children and young adults who receive physiologic replacement doses of estrogen. As an example, in a study of 70 adult women with Turner syndrome who underwent BMD testing by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), osteoporosis was diagnosed in seven (10 percent), six of whom were over age 45 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. None of the women with osteoporosis had ever received prolonged estrogen replacement. Fracture rates in the patients who had received estrogen therapy were no different from those of age-matched controls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Underestimation of bone mineral density in short subjects</strong> &ndash; A recognized limitation of DXA is that it measures areal rather than volumetric BMD, thus underestimating the BMD in smaller individuals. In a study of 40 adult women with Turner syndrome, osteoporosis was overdiagnosed in patients who were less than 150 cm tall, unless BMD measurements were adjusted for body size (and therefore bone size). After adjustment for body size, the prevalence of osteoporosis and fractures in the Turner syndrome patients who had been treated with estrogen was the same as age-matched controls without Turner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intrinsic bony abnormalities</strong> &ndash; Bone structure abnormalities that are intrinsic to Turner syndrome are suggested by studies that control for both ovarian hormone deficiency and height. In a study comparing 41 women with Turner syndrome with a control group of 35 karyotypically normal women with premature ovarian failure, a selective reduction in cortical (forearm) BMD was seen in the Turner syndrome patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. This difference persisted after adjustment for height, age of puberty, lifetime estrogen exposure, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Similarly, studies using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (CT), which is a more sensitive index of bone health than DXA, demonstrate that Turner syndrome patients have an abnormal trabecular microarchitecture and lower cortical bone porosity of the radius and tibia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. These intrinsic abnormalities of bone may be due to haploinsufficiency for bone-related X chromosome genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Thus, abnormal BMD appears to be intrinsic to Turner syndrome but can be minimized by optimal estrogen replacement, achieving target intakes of calcium and vitamin D, and perhaps growth hormone therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].

It is mandatory to repeat the karyotype at delivery (using cord blood or the neonate's blood) to either confirm the diagnosis, or rule it out (in case of an initial false-positive result), as recommended in international clinical guidelines on Turner syndrome care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sonographic findings associated with fetal aneuploidy&quot;, section on 'Turner syndrome'</a>).

Identification of mosaicism in Turner syndrome varies with the method of ascertainment, ranging from 34 percent with conventional cytogenetic techniques, to 60 percent with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques, to 74 percent in a study in which reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assays were used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].

This is because there are case reports of girls strongly suspected of having Turner syndrome on clinical grounds who have a normal peripheral blood lymphocyte karyotype (46,XX), but a 45,X karyotype on analysis of skin fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Risk of malignancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Turner syndrome are at increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity, due to their predilection for cardiovascular malformations, compounded by renal abnormalities and hypertension. Cardiovascular malformations include aortic valvular disease (mainly a bicuspid aortic valve), aortic arch anomalies (primarily coarctation), pulmonary or systemic venous abnormalities, ventricular septal defects, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Patients are at risk for aortic dilatation and dissection, particularly during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Aortic dissection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H523815943\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy and cardiovascular risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoporosis and fractures are common in adult women with Turner syndrome, and are thought to be due to both ovarian failure resulting in estrogen deficiency, and possibly haploinsufficiency for bone-related X chromosome genes resulting in abnormal trabecular microarchitecture. Appropriate estrogen replacement therapy starting in the second decade of life, and continued until the age of menopause, can help to prevent the suboptimal bone mineralization. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Osteoporosis and bone health'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Girls with Turner syndrome are more likely than girls without Turner syndrome to develop obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with Turner syndrome are also at increased risk for autoimmune endocrinopathies, most importantly, hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turner syndrome may be diagnosed incidentally during prenatal testing. More commonly, it is suspected based upon characteristic clinical features, which may include webbed neck and congenital lymphedema in a neonate, short stature and reduced growth velocity in a child, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> failure to develop breasts. Indications for diagnostic testing are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F114478\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114478 \">table 3</a>). The diagnosis is confirmed by karyotype analysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F107240\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107240 \">table 1</a>). Prompt diagnosis is important to permit effective treatment of short stature and management of comorbidities.
