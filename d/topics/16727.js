Synthetic cannabinoids are analogs of natural cannabinoids that are chemically synthesized. They may have been available in Europe as early as 2004, and were first reported in the United States in December 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They are now classified as Class I controlled substances by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and are illegal to possess, sell, and use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The synthetic compound is usually added to herbs or other plants (eg, <em>Canavalia sp, Nymphaea sp, Pedicularis sp, Leonotis sp</em>) to appear as a natural product and is typically marketed as &quot;incense&quot; or &quot;herbal remedies.&quot; They are sold under various names including: &quot;K2,&quot; &quot;spice,&quot; &quot;crazy monkey,&quot; &quot;chill out,&quot; &quot;spice diamond,&quot; &quot;spice gold,&quot; and &quot;chill X&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/1,3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-7</a>]. The clinical effects can be similar to natural marijuana intoxication but may also result in more severe life-threatening symptoms. Furthermore, the chemical analogs of THC used in synthetic cannabinoids are constantly changing to avoid quality controls and regulatory oversight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Such changes may introduce additional toxic effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1084269943\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synthetic cannabinoids have emerged as a recreational drug with significant toxicity in the United States and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Up to 7000 cases are reported annually to United States regional poison control centers with intermittent outbreaks associated with major effects warranting emergency department care, including fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]. Users are typically young males in their 20s to 30s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Among surveyed United States adolescents, 1.4 percent self-report regular use, typically as part of polysubstance abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In one multicenter prospective observational study of consultations performed by medical toxicologists, adolescents (13 to 18 years of age) accounted for about one quarter of patients presenting to hospitals and clinics for acute synthetic cannabinoid poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The use of synthetic cannabinoids is also increasing in Europe. From 2005 to 2011, synthetic cannabinoids represented two-thirds of all new substances reported to the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction Early Warning System [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1084269950\"><span class=\"h1\">TOXICITY AND PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many physiologic effects of synthetic cannabinoids are similar to cannabis (marijuana) and include tachycardia, conjunctival injection (red eyes), increased appetite, nystagmus, ataxia, and slurred speech. However, compared with cannabis, synthetic cannabinoids have a greater potential for serious neuropsychiatric toxicity including hallucinations, delirium, and psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/12,20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20-24</a>]. Furthermore, life-threatening toxicity caused by severe agitation or seizures is more characteristic of toxicity from synthetic cannabinoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication#H7890730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cannabis (marijuana): Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Adolescents and adults'</a>.)</p><p>Synthetic cannabinoids differ from naturally occurring cannabinoids in their potency and clinical effects. They are typically added to herbals or other hallucinogenic plants and smoked, but they also can be ingested or insufflated in pure form. Inhalation of burning incense adulterated with a synthetic cannabinoid compound has also caused mass intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. They can be partial or full agonists at cannabinoid receptors, and various synthetic cannabinoids have a diversity of potency and clinical effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/1,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25-27</a>]. They are metabolized mostly via oxidation and glucuronidation via liver cytochrome oxidase enzymes and excreted renally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Some compounds, such as the naphthoylindoles, have reported active metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. It is difficult to report specific toxic doses because the compounds and content are constantly changing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Degree of toxicity depends upon the amount used and the specific compound.</p><p>Synthetic cannabinoids are a chemically heterogeneic group of compounds. Similar to natural cannabinoids, they act as agonists at cannabinoid (CB) receptors (mostly CB1), which causes psychoactive effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>]. Other receptor involvement has yet to be elucidated but may include serotonin and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NDMA) receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Although they act on similar receptors, synthetic cannabinoids are often more potent agonists, with reports of potencies ranging from 2 to 800 times greater than delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The herbal product or plant that serves as the vehicle for synthetic cannabinoid delivery may also have hallucinogenic properties, or may contain other contaminants (such as caffeine, nicotine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>) that can contribute to clinical effects and toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>As of 2016, over 170 known synthetic cannabinoids have been manufactured by illicit drug laboratories and there is significant potential for novel compounds to appear in the future. Identified synthetic cannabinoids fall into many major structural groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/1,3-8,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-8,29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classical cannabinoids (ie, analogues of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol), derived from a dibenzopyran ring (eg, HU-210, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabilone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabilone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronabinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronabinol</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-classical cannabinoids, or cyclohexylphenol analogues (eg, CP 47, 59, 497, 540)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Naphthoylindoles (JWH-018, 073)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Naphthylmethylindoles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Naphthoylpyrroles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Naphthylmethylindenes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phenylacetylindoles (JWH-0259)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indolecarboxylates (eg, FUBICA-COOMe)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indolecaboxamides (eg ADB-PICA, MDMB-CHMICA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indazolecarboxylates (eg BINACA-COOMe)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indazolecarboxamides (eg, AMB- FUBINACA, ADB-CHMINACA or MAB-CHMINACA, AB-CHMFUPPYCA)</p><p/><p>An additional category includes miscellaneous compounds, including fatty acid amides such as oleamide, which have a similar structure to endogenous cannabinoids such as anandamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. They have various industrial uses (anti-slip agent, plastics), but their status as an abuse agent is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1084269958\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synthetic cannabinoids have a wide spectrum of clinical effects which occur soon after inhalation or insufflation and can last several hours to days, depending upon the compound and potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/12,20-24,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20-24,31</a>]. Signs of intoxication vary by the specific compound.</p><p>Clinical effects of some agents can share many characteristics of cannabis (marijuana) intoxication, including tachycardia, conjunctival injection, nystagmus, vomiting, ataxia, sedation, and slurred speech. However, unlike cannabis, synthetic cannabinoids have significant potential to cause serious and life-threatening toxicity.</p><p>The most common clinical effects based upon approximately 2000 reports of single agent exposure to regional poison control centers in 2010 consist of tachycardia, agitation, and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For these mild to moderate symptoms, duration is typically less than eight hours.</p><p>However, synthetic cannabinoids have significant potential to cause more serious toxicity. As an example, in a report from a multicenter, hospital-based registry of consultations performed by medical toxicologists, the frequency of signs or symptoms after single agent exposure to synthetic cannabinoids in 277 cases from 2010 to 2015 was as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agitation, coma, toxic psychosis, or other nervous system finding (eg, seizures or hallucinations,) - 66 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bradycardia, tachycardia, or other cardiovascular finding - 17 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhabdomyolysis - 6 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory depression - 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute kidney injury - 4 percent</p><p/><p>Neurologic findings such as severe psychomotor agitation, psychosis, seizures, hallucinations, delirium, dystonia, and paranoia have also been highlighted in several case reports and case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/12,20-24,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20-24,32,33</a>]. Marked motor activity from agitation or seizures may also cause hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis. Deaths have been reported, including sudden death after first-time use of inhaled synthetic cannabinoids in a 17-year-old adolescent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>More recently, additional manifestations of synthetic cannabinoid intoxication that vary from earlier reports have been described. For example, in one report of mass exposure of 33 adults to burning incense containing methyl 2-(1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1<em>H</em>-indazole-3-carboxamido)-3-methylbutanoate (AMB-FUBINACA) with the street name AK-47 24 Karat Gold, intoxication was marked by lethargy, blank staring, &ldquo;zombie-like&rdquo; groaning, and slow mechanical movements of the arms and legs that resolved in &lt;12 hours after exposure ceased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Synthetic cannabinoids have also been associated with ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, chest pain, and myocardial ischemia and infarction in adolescents and young adults without risk factors for these events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. In addition, an outbreak of reversible acute kidney injury occurred following regional use of a &quot;blueberry spice&quot; synthetic cannabinoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. It is unclear whether toxicity was due to the synthetic cannabinoid or an adulterant.</p><p>Because synthetic cannabinoids are frequently inhaled in a manner similar to cannabis (marijuana), they have the potential to cause chest pain due to acute exacerbations of asthma, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication#H7890730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cannabis (marijuana): Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Adolescents and adults'</a>.)</p><p>There are no reports of synthetic cannabinoid intoxication in young children. However, based upon experience with cannabis (marijuana) exposure in young children and evidence of central nervous system excitation in older patients, the clinician could expect a range of toxicity consisting of agitation, seizures, and coma with apnea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication#H7890723\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cannabis (marijuana): Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Children'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H252303046\"><span class=\"h1\">ANCILLARY STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most mild or moderate intoxications, no ancillary studies are typically needed.</p><p>All patients with marked agitation or seizures should have prompt measurement of blood glucose.

The synthetic compound is usually added to herbs or other plants to appear as a natural product and is typically marketed as &quot;incense&quot; or &quot;herbal remedies.&quot; They are sold under various names including: &quot;K2,&quot; &quot;spice,&quot; &quot;crazy monkey,&quot; &quot;chill out,&quot; &quot;spice diamond,&quot; &quot;spice gold,&quot; and &quot;chill X&quot;. Synthetic cannabinoids are usually smoked or insufflated during recreational use. (See <a href=\"#H1084269936\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1084269950\" class=\"local\">'Toxicity and pharmacology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synthetic cannabinoids have a wide spectrum of clinical effects which can be similar to cannabis (marijuana) intoxication, such as tachycardia, conjunctival injection, nystagmus, vomiting, ataxia, and slurred speech. However, more serious toxicity has frequently occurred including severe psychomotor agitation, toxic psychosis, seizures, and coma. Agitation has been complicated by hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis. Rarely, acute kidney injury, myocardial infarction, and sudden death in adolescents and young adults have been reported. (See <a href=\"#H1084269958\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most mild or moderate intoxications, no ancillary studies are needed. All patients with marked agitation or seizures should have prompt measurement of blood glucose. Additional testing may also be indicated based upon clinical features. Rapid urine drug screens will <strong>not</strong> detect synthetic cannabinoids. (See <a href=\"#H252303046\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H252303183\" class=\"local\">'Testing for synthetic cannabinoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute intoxication with synthetic cannabinoids is a clinical diagnosis that is typically made based upon a history of &quot;K2&rdquo;, &ldquo;Spice&quot;, or <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;fake&quot;/&quot;synthetic&quot;</span> marijuana use obtained from the patient or bystanders with consistent physical findings. (See <a href=\"#H1084269965\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe synthetic cannabinoid intoxication often have features common to many other intoxications and medical conditions, especially those that cause agitation, status epilepticus, or acute psychosis. A rapid serum glucose measurement (eg, fingerstick glucose), pulse oximetry, and a complete set of vital signs should be obtained in all patients with these symptoms. Other evaluation is indicated based upon the primary presenting symptoms and possible diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H1084269972\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of synthetic cannabinoid intoxication is supportive and determined by the presence and severity of specific clinical manifestations. Mild to moderate intoxication with dysphoria can often be managed with a dimly lit room, reassurance, and decreased stimulation. Benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>) can be helpful in controlling symptoms of anxiety and have a low side effect profile. (See <a href=\"#H252306714\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate intoxication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe agitation from synthetic cannabinoid intoxication usually do not respond to verbal de-escalation and require sedation with benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>) or other medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61852\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61852 \">algorithm 2</a>). Medical personnel should take precautions to protect themselves from violent behavior including a security presence and the application of physical restraints. (See <a href=\"#H1084269993\" class=\"local\">'Agitation and psychosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthermia (rectal temperature &gt;38.5&deg;C [101&deg;F]) may result from synthetic cannabinoid myotonic activity, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, or a combination of the three and should be managed aggressively with mechanical cooling measures. (See <a href=\"#H252307466\" class=\"local\">'Hyperthermia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures caused by synthetic cannabinoid warrant initial treatment with benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>) with repeat doses as necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55368\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55368 \">table 7</a>). If seizures are not controlled by appropriate doses of benzodiazepines, a second anticonvulsant agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a> should be administered. The administration of phenobarbital after benzodiazepines often results in the need for airway protection with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H252306943\" class=\"local\">'Seizures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain in association with cannabis use should be managed according to etiology (eg, myocardial ischemia versus pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax). Acute kidney injury has been associated with use of one type of synthetic cannabinoid in a limited outbreak but may also complicate rhabdomyolysis from severe psychomotor agitation. Treatment for acute kidney injury should be directed by the degree of renal dysfunction and related adverse effects such as hypertension, azotemia, and electrolyte abnormalities in consultation with a nephrologist. (See <a href=\"#H616550235\" class=\"local\">'Chest pain'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1084270007\" class=\"local\">'Acute kidney injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with synthetic cannabinoid intoxication and dystonic reactions receive benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>) instead of anticholinergic agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> to avoid exacerbation of hyperthermia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
