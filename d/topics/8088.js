The three forms of vascular access in children are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Native arteriovenous (AV) fistulas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcutaneously tunneled central venous catheters (CVCs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synthetic AV grafts</p><p/><p>Most would agree that the best form of access is an AV fistula because tunneled CVCs frequently malfunction, become infected, and often need replacement, thus damaging central veins and therefore precluding future fistula formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, a tunneled CVC is typically used in children when it is likely to be required for a short duration of time (eg, the child awaiting living-related renal transplantation). Because AV fistulas require time to mature (ie, several weeks to months), early planning is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Grafts are usually only used whenever other access(es) has failed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-access#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic hemodialysis vascular access&quot;, section on 'Time to first cannulation'</a>.)</p><p>In spite of its limitations, HD in the majority of children is initiated through a CVC as illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 2011 North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) report of 3363 children on HD, dialysis was performed in 79, 12, 7, and 0.3 percent of patients through external percutaneous catheters, AV fistulas, AV grafts, and external AV shunts, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most of the percutaneous catheter accesses were in the subclavian vein (51 percent), followed by the jugular (44 percent) and femoral (4 percent) veins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from the United States Renal Data system (USRDS) in 2009 showed that about 40 percent of children who were receiving chronic HD continued to use catheters for vascular access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) from 2008 demonstrated that catheters were used exclusively as vascular access for children below 10 years of age for both first HD treatment and continued HD treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. For older children, catheters were used in about 90 percent of patients at the start of HD treatment in both Australia and New Zealand and then fell to 54 percent in Australia and 29 percent in New Zealand with increasing use of AV fistulas in both countries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey of participating centers in the European Pediatric Dialysis Working Group, CVC was the access used in 60 percent of 111 patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, AV fistula in 38 percent of patients, and AV graft in 2 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>The reasons for the high prevalence of CVCs include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is technically more difficult to create AV fistulas, especially in small children, and their needling may be challenging for the child and staff in young children or children with behavioral problems. A center in France, however, has successfully used microsurgery to create fistulas even in infants, but this is not universally available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. AV grafts can be created in younger children who are &lt;15 kg, and although complications, such as stenosis, thrombosis, and infection, are more common, leading to a shorter vascular access survival time, reported outcomes are good at centers with clinical teams who have expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticipation of a short and temporary dialysis course prior to renal transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of needling accesses in children.</p><p/><p>Several studies have shown that the use of AV fistulas is associated with more effective dialysis with fewer complications (eg, infection, time spent in hospital) than percutaneous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,11</a>]. Based upon these observations, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) encourages the use of AV fistulas in children large enough for placement of an AV fistulas receiving hemodialysis who are not likely to receive a transplant within 12 months. Of note, when a CVC is used initially, the subclavian vein is usually not recommended as a site because it may preclude the changes for a successful creation of an AV fistula. (See <a href=\"#H349365238\" class=\"local\">'AV fistula'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H118551405\"><span class=\"h2\">Tunneled catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children undergoing chronic HD, the cuffed CVCs commonly used are dual lumen catheters composed of silicone or polyurethane composites. However, in small children, the distance between the arterial and venous ends of the catheter in double lumen catheters may be too far apart to allow successful positioning of both lumens. Split catheters (the two catheters are of equal length and joined proximally but separated distally) may be of benefit in this situation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66261\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66261 \">picture 1</a>), or the use of two separate single lumen catheter systems that can be inserted in the same vein with different exit sites or in different veins altogether.</p><p>In very small children, single lumen access may be more appropriate, as a larger catheter can be inserted, remembering that flow is proportional to the fourth power of the radius. In order to obtain two directional blood flows with a single lumen line, the dialysis circuit has to be modified. This can be achieved by the double-pump method, using two blood pumps, which pump alternately, or by using a single pump that pumps intermittently, using gravity to let blood flow back into the child. Both methods require an expansion chamber in the circuit to allow for the pressure changes. This results in an increased volume of blood in the circuit, which may require priming the external circuit with donor blood. There will be a larger degree of recirculation with this system. (See <a href=\"#H241185639\" class=\"local\">'Extracorporeal circuit'</a> below.)</p><p>Catheter sizes range from 6.5 to 14 FG and are chosen according to the size of the vessels of the child. These catheters are available in different lengths based on the gauge (12 or 18 cm for smaller gauge catheters, and 12 to 40 cm for larger gauge catheters) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57580\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57580 \">table 1</a>). Increasing the gauge of the vascular access will allow for higher blood flow rates. However, too large a catheter can potentially lead to obstruction of vessels, resulting in reduced venous return and therefore poor flow through the dialysis circuit.</p><p>Catheters are most commonly placed in the internal jugular vein and tunneled superficially to exit on the upper anterior chest. The catheter tip should be located at the junction of the superior vena cava (SVC) and right atrium, or in the right atrium to provide adequate dialysis. Catheters located in the SVC may have inadequate blood flow because the entry and exit sites often seal off as they abut up against the vessel wall. Positioning of a catheter in a small child can be difficult due to size and is best undertaken using ultrasound guidance by a skilled operator. In neonates, the femoral vein may be used as a temporary access, but this is not ideal as damage to the inferior venal cava may make future transplantation difficult. The subclavian vein should be avoided if at all possible, as stenosis may prevent successful fistula formation in the future.</p><p>The most frequent complication of tunneled catheters is malpositioning and therefore malfunction, which is increasingly common as the size of the child decreases.</p><p>Infection is also a frequent complication and is linked to malpositioning because repeated disconnection and flushing of the line increases the chances of introduction of organisms. Infection then causes vessel damage and stenosis, furthering the problem with poor flows and impacting future fistula creation. Strict catheter management decreases the risk of infection. In a study from a tertiary pediatric center in Israel with an infection rate of 0.05 per 100 treatment days, management includes rinsing the catheter, soaking the CVC head, handwashing (patient, nurse, and parent) with solutions that contain varying concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate, and the use of masks and sterile gloves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349365238\"><span class=\"h2\">AV fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AV fistulas are typically constructed with an end-to-side, vein-to-artery anastomosis. The most commonly used fistulas are created by anastomosing the radial artery and cephalic vein (radiocephalic or wrist fistula) or by anastomosing the brachial artery and cephalic vein (brachiocephalic or upper arm fistula) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The former can be difficult in small children due to vessel size. A two-stage basilic vein transposition may be preferred in small patients: the arterialized vein is moved to a more superficial position about two months after the anastomosis has been created, to make access easier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The lifetime of a fistula is superior to a tunneled line; over two-thirds are still functioning after five years, whereas reports of the survival of tunneled lines vary from 30 to 85 percent at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,14</a>].</p><p>Complication rates appear to be lower with AV fistulas (AVF):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a long-term follow-up study of children with an AVF or CVC for more than a year, access survival rates (including both primary and secondary access failure) were significantly higher for AVF compared with CVC. Primary access failure was 1 per 78.8 patient-months for AVF and 1 per 15.5 patient-months for CVCs. Failures thereafter for AVF and CVCs were 1 per 131.3 and 1 per 18.5 patient-months, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].The risk of infection was also lower with AV fistulas than CVCs (0.25 versus 3.2 per 100 patient-months). In addition, the annualized hospitalization rate for access malfunction was lower in patients with AVFs compared with those with CVCs (0.44 versus 3.1 percent). In the two-center study, the incidence of revisions requiring hospitalization was 0.2 and 2.7 per 100 treatments for fistulas compared with CVCs, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review from two large centers over a one-year period, the infection rate was 0.2 per 100 treatments in children with AVFs compared with 3.7 per 100 treatments in those with CVCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The incidence of revisions requiring hospitalization was 0.2 and 2.7 per 100 treatments for fistulas compared with CVCs, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The previously mentioned Israeli study also reported a lower rate of infection of 0.05 per 100 treatments in children including infants who received HD through a CVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In this study, the median catheter survival time was 310 days. The authors attributed the lower infection rate to adherence to a strict catheter management protocol.</p><p/><p>Based on these data, clinical experience, and patient preferences, we suggest initiating HD through an AV fistula in pediatric patients in whom there is time for it to mature, who are large enough that this is technically feasible, who are not likely to receive a transplant within six months, and who can be prepared to tolerate needling of the AV fistula by using psychological interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167575172\"><span class=\"h1\">HD EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Equipment for HD includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialyzer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis machine</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H241185639\"><span class=\"h2\">Extracorporeal circuit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extracorporeal circuit is composed of the arterial (inflow) and venous (outflow) lines, and the dialyzer. The volume of this circuit is restricted by the upper safe limit for extracorporeal blood volume that is dependent on the total blood volume of the patient. A child can tolerate 8 percent (up to a maximum of 10 percent) of his or her total blood volume (80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> estimated optimum weight) in the extracorporeal circuit. The volume of the lines and dialyzer should not exceed this volume. As an example, the upper safe limit for a child who weighs 10 kg (total blood volume of 800 mL) would be 64 to 80 mL.</p><p>A variety of HD tubing with specific volumes is commercially available. Tubing should be matched to the size of the patient based on the upper safe limit of extracorporeal blood volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77610 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>In some infants, however, even the smallest circuit may exceed the safe extracorporeal volume. If this is the case, the circuit must be primed with donated blood. This carries the risk of HLA (human leukocyte antigen) sensitization, with its consequent difficulties for transplantation, and is one reason for choosing peritoneal dialysis (PD) in infants, although HLA sensitization is less commonly seen in the first six months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The blood in the lines (if they have been primed with blood) is not washed back into the infant at the completion of HD unless a transfusion is required, because this would be the equivalent of giving blood equal to the volume of the lines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6760067\"><span class=\"h2\">Dialyzer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of dialyzer generally used in children is a hollow fiber design that minimizes blood volume, and provides reliable and predictable solute clearance and ultrafiltration coefficients. A wide variety of hollow fiber dialyzers with different blood volumes is commercially available, and the dialyzer is selected on the basis of the size of the child (ie, surface area of the child) and the type of hemodialysis (eg, standard or hemodiafiltration [HDF]). The size of the dialyzer is calculated by its surface area. The surface area should be as large as possible to optimize clearances but should not exceed that of the child. At present, dialyzer surface areas range from 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> up to 1.7 m<sup>2 </sup>and above, although dialyzers for the new CARPEDIEM (Cardio-Renal Pediatric Dialysis Emergency Machine) and NIDUS machines are much smaller. (See <a href=\"#H348531\" class=\"local\">'Small infants'</a> below.)</p><p>A discussion of the different types of dialyzers is presented separately.

Pressure monitors located proximal to the blood pump and distal to the dialyzer guard against excessive suction of blood from and excessive resistance to blood return to the patient's vascular access site. Modern machines are able to combine diffusive and convective transport (HDF) and generate ultrapure dialysis and infusion fluids online. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the hemodialysis apparatus&quot;, section on 'Dialysis machines'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, HD machines used in children, especially small children and infants, must have the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A volumetric fluid removal system, in which the inflow and outflow volumes from the dialyzer are measured so that ultrafiltrate (UF) volume (volume removed during the dialysis treatment) is measured directly and very small amounts of fluid can be removed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Capability of low blood flow speeds.

Solute clearance is increased with HDF, which raises the convective clearance rate.

KUf depends on the surface area of the dialyzer and the membrane characteristics.

Removal of more than 5 percent of body weight in one session, or 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per minute, is very likely to result in symptomatic hypovolemia.

Target weight can only be determined by careful but persistent fluid removal to achieve a normal BP for age after dialysis. The child who is always hypertensive is likely to be above his or her target weight; antihypertensive medications are usually unnecessary when optimum weight is achieved. However, some children, particularly those with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), may continue to pass urine and do not need fluid removal during dialysis at all.</p><p>Bioimpedance spectroscopy and echocardiographic measurements of inferior vena cava dimensions have been used to assess optimum weight.

In the largest study of 1454 pediatric patients, who were dialyzed from 1991 to 1996, 31 percent developed a cardiac-related event, including arrhythmias (19.6 percent), valvular disease (11.7 percent), cardiomyopathy (9.6 percent), and death from cardiac arrest (3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

This is not surprising because it is challenging to compare survival rates over time with changes in the population treated, as children with potentially poorer outcome have been increasingly accepted for RRT. These include young infants with CKD and those with severe comorbidities. Acceptance rates for such children vary, affecting not only outcome data over time, but also results from different parts of the world, because centers and countries will have different acceptance criteria.</p><p>Despite the above issues, several studies have demonstrated improved survival rates over time:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from the ANZDATA registry report an improvement in mortality, from 11 per 100 patient-years between 1963 and 1972 to 1.8 per 100 patient-years in those starting dialysis after 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Dutch patients, the 5 and 10-year survival rates improved from 81 and 79 percent to 89 and 85 percent for patients treated between 1972 and 1981 compared with those treated from 1982 to 1991 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

In this report, children aged 10 to 14 years on hemodialysis (HD) actually had a deceased survival rate. In addition, a single center reported similar mortality for infants starting dialysis aged &lt;18 months during two different eras from 1983 to 1995 and 1996 to 2008, with an overall mortality of 54 percent over 25 years of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6760197\"><span class=\"h4\">Comorbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comorbidities are common, occurring in about 30 percent of infants and young children who receive HD.

It is crucial that these unique aspects are addressed in order to effectively and safely perform pediatric HD and reduce potential complications, thereby improving life expectancy and quality of life for these patients who face a lifetime of renal replacement therapy. Optimal care is provided by a multidisciplinary team that manages dialysis treatment and nutrition, ensures effective vascular access, and provides psychosocial support. (See <a href=\"#H118551084\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Good vascular access is essential for successful HD. Because of technical difficulties in creating native arteriovenous (AV) fistulas, especially in infants and small children, the desire to avoid needling the access, and the anticipation of a short course of dialysis, HD is initiated through a percutaneous catheter in the majority of children. However, AV fistulas have been shown to be more effective for HD and have fewer side effects. As a result, we suggest placement of an AV fistula for initiation of HD in children who are large enough that this is technically feasible, are not likely to receive a transplant within six months, and are tolerant of access needling (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In these settings, a percutaneous CVC is used to initiate HD. The size and length of the catheter is determined by the size of the child and his or her vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57580\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57580 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6760051\" class=\"local\">'Vascular access'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The HD equipment must be modified for pediatric patients, particularly infants and small children, as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Selection of the HD tubing and dialyzer to ensure that the volume of the extracorporeal circuit does not exceed the upper limit of safety, which is 8 to 10 percent of their total blood volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77610 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H241185639\" class=\"local\">'Extracorporeal circuit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The size of the dialyzer is dependent on the size of the child and should match his or her surface area. (See <a href=\"#H241185624\" class=\"local\">'Dialyzer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The dialysis machine used in children should have the capabilities to remove small amounts of fluid, directly measure the volume removed, and use low blood flow rates and lines of varying blood volumes. (See <a href=\"#H6760075\" class=\"local\">'HD machine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dialysis prescription for each patient includes the chosen dialyzer (including size), blood flow rates, length and frequency of dialysis sessions, and the amount of fluid to be removed each session based on the estimation of the optimum weight. (See <a href=\"#H167575180\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis prescription'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that evaluation of the adequacy of dialysis using measures of dialyzer clearance of urea <span class=\"nowrap\">(Kt/V),</span> protein catabolic rate, and growth be performed once a month in children who receive chronic HD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6760107\" class=\"local\">'Measurements of adequacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications seen in children who receive chronic HD include malnutrition, poor growth, and increased risk of neurodevelopmental and psychosocial impairment, mineral and bone disorders, and cardiovascular disease. The use of hemodiafiltration (HDF) and more frequent dialysis reduces these complications. (See <a href=\"#H6760115\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality is 30 times higher in children on dialysis compared with gender-matched normal children. The major cause of death is due to cardiovascular disease. Risk factors that increase mortality include the presence of comorbid conditions (eg, severe neurologic impairment and congenital heart disease), initiation of dialysis before one year of age, and primary renal diseases associated with oligoanuria, pulmonary hypoplasia, and congenital nephrotic syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H6760161\" class=\"local\">'Mortality rate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, long-term quality of life is lower in children on dialysis compared with normal healthy controls and children who receive a renal transplant.
