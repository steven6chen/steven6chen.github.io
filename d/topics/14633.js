Several forms of pulmonary disease have been described, including interstitial pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), pulmonary nodules, solitary masses, and also (rarely) pleural effusion. The clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity are discussed separately.

The cough may develop within hours of the first dose or weeks to months later. It is more common in women, non-smokers, and persons of Chinese origin. The cough typically resolves one to four weeks after discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor but in a subgroup of coughers, resolution may take several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-disease-induced-by-cardiovascular-drugs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One important caveat is that cough may be a symptom of heart failure, and a thorough history and physical examination are needed to ascertain whether the cough is truly related to the ACE inhibitor therapy. An increased incidence of cough does not appear to occur with the angiotensin II receptor antagonists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Angioedema</strong> &ndash; Angioedema, particularly of the oropharynx and larynx, complicates ACE inhibitor therapy in approximately 0.1 to 0.7 percent of recipients. Since ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema typically causes swelling of the mouth, lips, tongue, larynx, pharynx, and subglottic tissues, upper airway compromise may be the presenting sign. Pruritus and urticaria are typically absent. Unlike classical hereditary angioedema, C1 inhibitor level and function and thus the C4 levels are normal in ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema.

An eosinophilic pneumonia was found in most cases, but an acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis with lymphocytic infiltration has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-disease-induced-by-cardiovascular-drugs/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. The radiographic appearance is nonspecific, with bilateral patchy ground glass or consolidative opacities being the most frequent finding. The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of peripheral blood or bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophilia, exclusion of infection, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> response to empiric drug discontinuation. Occasionally, a lung biopsy is needed. Therapy consists of drug withdrawal; occasionally systemic glucocorticoids have been used for patients with more severe respiratory impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-disease-induced-by-cardiovascular-drugs/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

The cross-reactivity with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is difficult to ascertain because of the phenomenon that patients with ACE inhibitor induced angioedema may continue to have episodes for weeks to months following discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor, which may overlap with initiation of the ARB.

Some patients are able to tolerate 81 mg, but develop symptoms at 162 or 325 mg. Thus, AERD should be suspected in patients who develop dyspnea within three hours of initiation of aspirin therapy or an increase in the dose. Most patients will experience a combination of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, wheezing, and dyspnea. Additional symptoms may include facial <span class=\"nowrap\">flushing/erythema,</span> laryngospasm, abdominal cramps, epigastric pain, and hypotension. Bronchoconstriction is typically reversible with an inhaled bronchodilator, which should be given promptly. Aspirin desensitization is an option for patients with AERD who require aspirin therapy; premedication with a leukotriene-modifying agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a> 10 mg twice a day for one day before and then 10 mg once daily, is recommended. The protocol for aspirin desensitization is discussed separately.

However, beta-blocking medications that act on beta2 receptors can also cause bronchoconstriction. Since beta-adrenergic receptors of large and small airway smooth muscle are primarily the beta2 subtype, nonselective <span class=\"nowrap\">beta1/beta2</span> blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>) are more likely to cause bronchoconstriction in susceptible individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-disease-induced-by-cardiovascular-drugs/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In contrast, selective beta1-blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>) have a 20-fold greater affinity for beta1 adrenergic receptors than beta2 adrenergic receptors and, therefore, are less likely to induce bronchoconstriction.</p><p>Studies of selective beta1-blockers are reassuring regarding their safety in patients with COPD, including those with a reversible component. In a meta-analysis that examined the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers given as a single dose or for longer duration, the beta1-blockers did not reduce the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) or increase respiratory symptoms compared with placebo, and beta1-blocker treatment did not reduce the improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> following inhaled beta2-agonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-disease-induced-by-cardiovascular-drugs/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A subgroup analysis revealed no change in results for those participants with severe chronic airways obstruction or for those with a reversible obstructive component.</p><p>The benefits of using beta blockers, like any other drug, must be weighed on a case-by-case basis against the risk of side effects. Nonselective beta-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma and used with caution in patients with an exacerbation of COPD. The use of selective beta1-blockers in patients who have COPD and a cardiovascular indication is discussed separately.
