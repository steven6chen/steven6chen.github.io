The chance of developing AF is tied closely to age, with AF rare before the age of 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition to age, there are many types of cardiac and medical conditions that are also closely linked to AF. These include hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease, obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and sleep-apnea syndrome. It is well established that high levels of alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] can increase the probability of developing AF, and that hyperthyroidism can cause AF. Evidence for caffeine and energy drinks, while suspected, is questionable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Furthermore, while exercise can be protective against atrial fibrillation, endurance athletics may be a cause for atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is also well established that AF is more common in individuals who have a first-degree relative who developed AF at a young age. There is also a variety of acute conditions that can initiate AF such as cardiac surgery, pulmonary embolus, and inflammatory lung conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The precise mechanisms by which age and the other conditions listed above increase the propensity for development of AF are understood poorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63675 \">figure 1</a>). However, these conditions may impact the triggers for AF, which commonly arise in the pulmonary veins or the substrate for maintenance of AF, which broadly relates to atrial size and the extent of fibrosis. Some of the factors that may play a role in the mechanisms of AF include autonomic tone, inflammation, atrial pressure and wall stress, and genetics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Other factors'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will provide a broad overview of the current understanding of the mechanisms of AF.

The following section will discuss the link between these conditions and AF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11423999\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: TRIGGERS AND SUBSTRATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial fibrillation (AF) may present as a paroxysmal (self-terminating AF within seven days), a persistent (one that lasts greater than seven days), or a long-standing persistent AF (continuous AF for 12 months or greater). The term &ldquo;permanent AF&rdquo; should be used when both the patient and physicians agree to not pursue strategies to restore or maintain sinus rhythm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p>This wide range of clinical presentations is likely due to an interaction between a trigger and the substrate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63675 \">figure 1</a>). AF is initiated by rapid firing (or triggers) from the pulmonary veins (PV). Early in the course of AF the atrium is relatively healthy and as a result sinus rhythm is spontaneously restored. As the substrate remodels further over time, AF no longer terminates spontaneously and becomes persistent. With more extensive remodeling of the atrium, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain sinus rhythm and the patient and physician may agree no longer to attempt to maintain sinus rhythm, with the AF thereby being considered permanent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186294961\"><span class=\"h2\">Triggers of AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been known for many years that a single focus firing rapidly in the atria can be a trigger for fibrillatory conduction throughout the atria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is now well established that the most common site of the rapid atrial firing that triggers AF is the PVs. Catheter ablation of AF depends in large part on the electrical isolation of the PVs from the remainder of the atrium. Electrophysiologic evaluation of the PVs has identified myocardial tissue that can lead to repetitive firing or even the presence of episodic reentrant activation in the veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Additionally, stretch can increase the propensity for rapid firing from the PVs as a result of stretch sensitive ion channels. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It has been speculated that the mechanism of atrial stretch may help explain the association between AF and mitral regurgitation as well as various types of heart failure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8804369\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of atrial premature beats and other arrhythmia triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AF is initiated (triggered) predominantly by rapid firing from PVs. Much less commonly, AF can be triggered by non-PV sites of rapid firing (such as tissue near the PV including the Vein of Marshall, the superior vena cava, or coronary sinus) or by other types of supraventricular arrhythmias including atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), orthodromic AV reciprocating tachycardia, and atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/6,13-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13-23</a>]. In some patients, successful elimination of AF with catheter ablation requires both isolation of the PVs, as well as elimination of these non-PV triggers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation: Clinical applications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186294723\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of atrial flutter and SVT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, and other supraventricular tachycardias can initiate AF in predisposed patients. The interaction between these arrhythmias and AF is not well understood, but atrial flutter and AF commonly coexist.</p><p>In some instances, elimination of atrial flutter will diminish <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eliminate episodes of AF. Nevertheless, elimination of the right atrial reentry circuit responsible for typical flutter frequently does not eliminate the predisposition to AF that is predominately a left-atrial problem in a large number of patients. Many studies have demonstrated that patients who undergo catheter ablation of typical atrial flutter have a very high probability of developing AF over the ensuing five years. This is true regardless of whether AF had been observed prior to development of typical atrial flutter. This has clinical implications when it comes to ablation, but also has implications for anticoagulation strategies and patient follow-up. Nevertheless, for most patients, it makes sense to try to eliminate the organized supraventricular tachycardia, especially if right-sided by ablation before considering PV isolation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other more extensive ablation procedures to eliminate AF, as the AF may be reduced or eliminated by eliminating the other tachycardia first.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186294983\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance of AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with persistent AF, the prevailing understanding of the mechanism is that, once triggered, the arrhythmia is maintained (sustained) by one or more abnormalities in the atrial tissue. This process may explain why the failure rate of PV isolation is as high as 40 to 60 percent at one year: The trigger(s) may have been treated but not the abnormalities that sustain AF once triggered (initiated).</p><p>The role of localized sources (electrical rotors and focal impulses) in the initiation and maintenance of AF was explored in the CONFIRM trial of 92 patients undergoing ablation procedures for paroxysmal or persistent (72 percent) AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Consecutive patients were prospectively treated (not randomly assigned) in a 1:2 case-cohort design with either conventional ablation at sources identified within the atria followed by conventional ablation or conventional ablation alone. Localized sources were identified in 97 percent of cases (70 percent rotors and 30 percent focal impulses) with sustained AF, each with an average of 2.1 sources. During a median of 273 days, patients treated with treatment of both sources and conventional ablation had a significantly higher freedom from AF (82.4 versus 44.9 percent). <br/></p><p>Similar information was reported, indicating that &ldquo;driver domains,&rdquo; located in specific areas of the atria, act as unstable re-entry circuits that perpetuate atrial fibrillation in patients who have persistent AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Murine cell cultures show a differential ion channel gene expression associated with atrial tissue remodeling (ie, decreased SCN5A, CACN1C, KCND3, and GJA1; and increased KCNJ2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Fibrillatory complexity, increased in late compared with early stage cultures, was associated with a decrease in rotor tip meandering and increase in wavefront curvature.</p><p>Rotors are not the only explanation. In a study using high-density, simultaneous, biatrial, epicardial mapping of persistent and longstanding persistent AF in patients undergoing open heart surgery, several non-reentrant drivers were present in both atria in 11 or 12 patients with two to four <span class=\"nowrap\">foci/patients</span> were seen in both atria but generally in the lateral left atrial free wall, and likely acted as drivers. Reentry was not found to be the mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Likely, the substrate to maintain AF is a combination of reentrant activity and focal triggers. In a study of biatrial epicardial mapping of AF in sheep, wave propagation patterns were passing wave (69 percent occurrence, 68.6 percent of total time), point source (20.4, 13.1 percent), wave collision (4, 2.8 percent), reentrant wave (0.7, 6.3 percent), half-rotation (2.9, 4.4 percent), wave splitting (2.7, 4.3 percent), conduction block (0.05, 0.03 percent) and figure of eight reentry (0.05, 0.05 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Periods of repetitive activity were detected in the left and right atria. </p><p>The following sections describe factors that might contribute to the maintenance of AF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8621795\"><span class=\"h3\">Atrial remodeling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial remodeling involves the concept that there are structural changes, such as fibrosis, or electrical changes, such as refractory-period dispersion or conduction display, in the atria that can predispose to the development and maintenance of AF. In some instances, structural and electrical changes occur simultaneously. These processes can facilitate or create electrical reentrant circuits or triggers that can lead to AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/13,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,30</a>]. It is also well established that the presence of AF results in remodeling of the atrium over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This explains the well-established concept that AF begets AF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51670\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51670 \">figure 2</a>). Thus, the longer a patient has been in continuous AF, the less likely it is to terminate spontaneously, and harder it is to restore and maintain sinus rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186295411\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrical remodeling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paroxysmal AF commonly precedes chronic AF. It has been suggested even after only a few minutes, AF induces transient changes in atrial electrophysiology that promote its perpetuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This might occur through a tachycardiomyopathy or through &quot;electrical remodeling&quot; of the atria by AF, leading to a progressive decrease in atrial refractoriness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Electrical remodeling results from the high rate of electrical activation, which stimulates the AF-induced changes in refractoriness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Tachycardia-induced changes in refractoriness are spatially nonuniform and there is increased variability both within and among various atrial regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It is possible that the change in atrial refractory period observed after an episode of AF predisposes to the spontaneous recurrence of AF in the days following cardioversion.</p><p>In addition to the shortening of the refractory period, chronic, rapid, atrial pacing-induced AF results in other changes within the atria, including an increase in the expression and distribution of connexin 43 and heterogeneity in the distribution of connexin 40, both of which are intercellular gap junction proteins (&quot;gap junctional remodeling&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]; cellular remodeling is due to apoptotic death of myocytes with myolysis, which may not be entirely reversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]; the induction of sinus node dysfunction, demonstrated by prolonged corrected sinus node recovery time, reduced maximal heart rate in response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a>, and lower intrinsic heart rate after administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]; and an increase in P wave duration and intraatrial conduction time.</p><p>A clinical study evaluated the hypothesis of electrical remodeling by the use of atrial pacing-induced AF in patients with a history of supraventricular tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. AF significantly shortened the right-atrial effective refractory period after only a few minutes, and temporal recovery of the refractory period occurred over about eight minutes. Upon termination of AF, there was an increased propensity for the induction of another episode of AF that decreased with increasing time after the initial AF reversion. The second also tends to last longer than the first.</p><p>The time to recurrence was also evaluated in a review of 61 patients who had daily electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings using transtelephonic monitoring: 57 percent had recurrent AF during the first month after cardioversion, with a peak incidence during the first five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Among patients with recurrence, there was a positive correlation between the duration of the shortest coupling interval of atrial premature beats after cardioversion, which correlates with the refractory period and the timing of recurrence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60431\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60431 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to the normal situation in which the atrial refractory period shortens with an increase in rate (as in AF) and prolongs when the rate decreases, the refractory period fails to lengthen appropriately at slow rates (eg, with return to sinus rhythm) in patients with acute or chronic AF. The duration of AF has no significant impact upon the extent of these electrophysiologic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Atrial electrical remodeling is reversed gradually after the restoration of sinus rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/23,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,34</a>]. This may be one of the explanations for the early or immediate return of AF after cardioversion. In one study of 25 patients, the atrial refractory period increased and the adaptation of atrial refractoriness to rate was normal by four weeks after cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In another report of 38 patients, the atrial refractory period increased by one week, with some variation in different regions of the atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This observation has important clinical implications. &#160;</p><p>The mechanism for electrical remodeling and shortening of the atrial refractory period is not entirely clear; a possible explanation is ion-channel remodeling, with a decrease in the protein content of the L-type calcium channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Support for this comes from an animal study in which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, an L-type calcium antagonist, prevented electric remodeling of short-duration AF (one day or less) and hastened complete recovery, without affecting inducibility of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Similar findings have been noted in humans as verapamil, but not <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, prevented remodeling when given prior to the electrophysiologic induction of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> is also effective in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], while beta blockers had no effect on electrical remodeling in an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In comparison, cytosolic calcium overload, induced by hypercalcemia or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, which increases the intracellular concentration of calcium by activating the sodium-calcium exchanger, enhances electrical remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/36,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,39,40</a>]. The effect of digoxin, which is not due to its vagotonic activity, is associated with an increase in the inducibility and duration of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Calcium leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum may trigger and maintain AF. It is known that protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), resulting in dissociation of the channel-stabilizing subunit calstabin2, causes sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium leak in failing hearts. This phenomenon seems to be involved in triggering ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p>Using similar logic, these proteins were investigated in atrial tissues from both dogs and humans with AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Atrial tissue in those with AF showed a significant increase in PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 and a decrease in calstabin2 binding to the channel. Channels isolated from dogs with AF had an increased open probability under conditions simulating diastole compared with channels from control hearts, suggesting that these AF channels could predispose to a diastolic SR calcium leak. The conclusion was that SR calcium leak due to RyR2 PKA hyperphosphorylation may play a role in the initiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maintenance of AF. Other studies also suggest that RyR2 receptor-mediated calcium leak drives progressive development of an atrial fibrillation substrate in a transgenic mouse model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. </p><p>The effects of calcium overload are quite complex. It is likely that triggers and substrates initiate short episodes of AF that then lead to calcium overload and over a period of minutes there is activation of the I <sub>Ca</sub>,L current that increases I <sub>K1</sub>, decreases I <sub>Na</sub>, increases I<sub>KACh</sub>,<sub> </sub>and decreases I<sub>TO</sub>. This can affect the action-potential duration and allow for more reentry to occur. As reentry occurs, the substrate changes and there is remodeling through calcium handling abnormalities as well as mRNA transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and ultimately perhaps with protein decrease, changes in connexons, including, Cx40, that can affect conduction. The calcium-handling abnormalities can also lead to hypocontractility and atrial dilatation, thereby affecting even more the possibility of developing AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Both animal and human studies suggest that angiotensin II is involved in electrical and atrial myocardial remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Actions of angiotensin II on the heart&quot;</a>).

An increase in conduction heterogeneity noted in this model is thought to play a major role in the creation of reentrant circuits in the dilated atria. Patients with AF also display increased atrial fibrous tissue content, along with increased expression of collagen I and III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>], as well as up-regulation of MMP-2 protein, and down-regulation of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, TIMP-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

Inflammation is suggested to be linked to various pathological processes, such as oxidative stress, apoptosis, and fibrosis that promote the creation and perpetuation of AF substrate. Several of the downstream effects of inflammation in the heart are thought to be mediated by oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. </p><p>Indeed, studies in patients with AF demonstrate increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the fibrillating atrium compared with normal atria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>]. Several major enzymatic sources of ROS have been implicated in AF. Of these, NAPDH oxidase (specifically its NOX2 isoform) has been shown to be elevated in humans with AF in a variety of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>].

In addition to the increase in ROS noted in tissue from patients with AF, experimental evidence suggests that ROS may be implicated not only in promoting AF but also in maintaining atrial&nbsp;arrhythmia. The administration of antioxidants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> or statins (which are known to have pleiotropic antioxidant effects) decreased AF inducibility in canine models of tachypacing-induced AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>].

In addition, the response of atrial activity to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> infusion suggests a reentrant rather than a focal mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Adenosine increases the inward potassium rectifier current, which shortens refractory periods and would accelerate reentrant circuits. In contrast, this effect would slow an automatic or triggered focus. In a series of 33 patients with AF undergoing electrophysiology study, adenosine increased the dominant frequencies, supporting reentrant rather than focal sources for the perpetuation of AF.</p><p>It has been suggested that at least four to six independent wavelets are required to maintain AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. These wavelets rarely reenter themselves but can re-excite portions of the myocardium recently activated by another wavefront, a process called random reentry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7,102-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,102-104</a>]. As a result, there are multiple wavefronts of activation that may collide with each other, extinguishing themselves or creating new wavelets and wavefronts, thereby perpetuating the arrhythmia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73931\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73931 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>The reentrant circuits are therefore unstable; some disappear, while others reform. These circuits have variable but short cycle lengths, resulting in multiple circuits to which atrial tissue cannot respond in a 1:1 fashion. As a result, functional block, slow conduction, and multiple wave fronts develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>Patients with AF may have increased dispersion of refractoriness. This correlates with enhanced inducibility of AF and spontaneous episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>] likely related to unstable reentry circuits. Some patients have site-specific dispersion of atrial refractoriness and intraatrial conduction delays resulting from nonuniform atrial anisotropy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. This appears to be a common property of normal atrial tissue, but there are further conduction delays to and within area surrounding the AV node in patients with induced AF, suggesting an important role for the low right atrium in the genesis of AF.</p><p>Abnormalities in restitution as well as the spatial distribution of such abnormalities can be related to the persistence of AF. In one study, monophasic action potential recordings were evaluated in patients with AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. The action potential duration was plotted as a function of the preceding diastolic interval, and the slope of the action potential duration versus the diastolic interval (the restitution curve) was determined. If the slope was greater than one, oscillations occurred that may cause localized conduction delay or block resulting in a wave break giving rise to atrial fibrillation. </p><p>These different patterns of conduction are reflected in the morphology of electrograms recorded with mapping during induced AF. Single potentials were indicative of rapid uniform conduction, short double potentials indicated collision, long double potentials were indicative of conduction block, while fragmented potentials were markers for pivoting points or slow conduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52152 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/108,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,109</a>].</p><p>Sites of fragmented potentials or complex fractionated atrial electrograms are potential targets for radiofrequency ablation to terminate AF as they may represent critical areas from which AF originates and perpetuates.

The impulse may circulate around a central line of functional block, so-called leading circle reentry; this type of reentry tends not to be stable but rather to drift through the atria until it is extinguished. The perpetuation of AF may also depend importantly upon macroreentry around natural orifices and structures in the atrium, which provides a rationale and anatomic landmarks for ablative treatment. The collision of wavefronts cancels many atrial depolarizations that might otherwise reach the AV node, resulting in a slower heart rate than might otherwise have occurred (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57781%7ECARD%2F58689\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57781 graphicRef58689 \">figure 7A-B</a>).</p><p>Although multiple wandering wavelets probably account for the majority of AF, one study reported nine patients in whom a single, rapidly firing focus was identified with electrophysiologic mapping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Organized and rapid atrial activity with a centrifugal and consistent pattern of atrial activation resulted from this focus, but it fired irregularly with striking and abrupt changes in atrial cycle lengths. In most of the patients, the focus was near the ostia of great vessels and was amenable to radiofrequency ablation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55997\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55997 \">figure 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66498\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66498 \">figure 9</a>).</p><p>Small reentrant sources, called rotors, may drive or maintain AF in some cases.

However, antral pulmonary venous reentrant and focal drivers may be responsible for AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The complexity of such drivers increase with prolonged AF.

The ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation (AF) is typically irregularly irregular, with a ventricular rate that may be slow, moderate, or rapid depending on the capacity of the AV node to conduct impulses. The rate of AV nodal conduction is dependent upon multiple factors, including electrical properties of the node and the influence of the autonomic nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. In addition, the use drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers may influence AV nodal function.

Ventricular rates above 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> suggest catecholamine excess, parasympathetic withdrawal, or the existence of an accessory bypass tract as occurs in the preexcitation syndrome. The QRS complexes are widened in the last setting and must be distinguished from a rate-related or underlying bundle branch block.</p><p/><p>In the classical view, the AV node is bombarded by impulses from the fibrillating atria. Some impulses traverse the AV node and reach the specialized infranodal conduction system and then the ventricles. However, most atrial impulses penetrate the AV node from varying distances and then are extinguished when they encounter the refractoriness of an earlier wavefront; this phenomenon of concealed conduction in turn creates a refractory wave that affects succeeding impulses. The failure of the refractory period to shorten with increasing rate (as occurs in the atria) further decreases the likelihood of an impulse traversing the AV node.</p><p>Anatomically distinct AV nodal inputs, called the slow and fast pathways, are involved in the ventricular response to AF. The importance of these pathways has been demonstrated in radiofrequency ablation studies in which ablation reduced the number of beats that successfully reached the infranodal conduction system and the ventricles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/117-120\" class=\"abstract_t\">117-120</a>].

AV conduction is enhanced and refractoriness reduced by the sympathetic fibers, and conduction reduced and refractoriness prolonged by the parasympathetic fibers.</p><p>The net effect of the electrophysiologic properties of the AV node is that the rate of conduction into the specialized infranodal conduction system is (fortunately) much slower than the rate of the fibrillating atria. In some cases, the high degree of refractoriness in the AV node with AF results in high-grade or third-degree block. In this setting, the pacemaker that controls the ventricles is below the AV node.

The development of AF in such a patient can result in very rapid transmission of atrial impulses to the ventricles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>] and can rarely cause ventricular fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

It is also important to recognize that the presence of an accessory pathway can increase the propensity for development of AF. In patients with AF who have Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, catheter ablation of the accessory pathway is indicated to lower the sudden death risk but also to decrease the probability of recurrent AF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H952331\"><span class=\"h2\">Unexpected ventricular rates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ventricular response to AF characteristically is irregularly irregular although it may appear regular in the presence of complete AV block.

In some cases, triggering foci outside of the PVs may initiate AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/121-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-124</a>]. Alternatively, persistence of the substrate for maintaining AF (abnormal electrical properties of the atria themselves) may be more important than the triggering foci, especially in chronic AF.</p><p>However, there is increasing evidence that when AF does recur late after PVI, it often represents incomplete electrical isolation of the PVs, either due to resumption of conduction across the ablation scar or to residual conduction in PVs that were not successfully ablated. Most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/125-128\" class=\"abstract_t\">125-128</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>], studies of the former mechanism support the hypothesis that resumption of PV-left atrial (LA) conduction is associated with an increased risk of recurrent AF. However, recurrent conduction across ablated lesions is more common than clinically evident recurrent AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/127,130\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,130</a>].</p><p>Pre-existing LA scarring may predispose patients to late recurrence. In a series of 700 consecutive patients undergoing first-time PVI, scarring was detected in 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. These patients had a much higher rate of recurrence than those without scarring (57 versus 19 percent).</p><p>Possible causes of scarring include atrial remodeling and inflammation. The patients with scarring had significant elevations in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to those without scarring (5.9 versus 0.31 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span>. This is consistent with other studies showing a relationship between serum CRP and AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].

Nonuniform atrial conduction is greatest on days two and three in this setting, and the longest atrial conduction time is greatest on day three after open heart surgery; these abnormalities coincide with the time of greatest risk for AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. The degree of atrial inflammation after surgery in dogs was associated with a proportional increase in the inhomogeneity of atrial conduction and in the duration of AF; antiinflammatory therapy decreased the inhomogeneity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. Nevertheless, the mechanism of AF in the postoperative period is likely multifactorial. It is important to note that in most of the patients, especially those without a prior history of AF, that the AF is self-limited, and antiarrhythmic drug therapy can usually be stopped two to three months following surgery when the inflammation has subsided.

In a sheep model, weight gain was associated with increased left atrial volume, fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrates, and lipidosis. There was reduced conduction velocity in atrial tissue and increased inducible and spontaneous AF with obesity. Atrial endothelin-A and -B receptors, endothelin-1, atrial interstitial and cytoplasmic transforming growth factor beta1, and platelet-derived growth factor were higher with obesity. In a clinical study of 110 patients undergoing AF ablation versus 20 reference patients without AF, pericardial fat volumes were associated with AF, its chronicity, and its symptom burden. Pericardial fat predicted AF recurrence post-ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>]. Associations persisted after adjusting for body weight but body mass index was not associated with these outcomes in multivariate-adjusted models. In another report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>], weight management with subsequent weight loss was associated with improved AF symptom burden scores, symptom severity scores, number of episodes, and cumulative duration of AF. This preliminary information does not yet prove that obesity causes AF by any specific mechanism. In a study of atrial sheep myocytes, acute, short-term incubation in free fatty acids resulted in no differences in passive or active properties of isolated left atrial myocytes but stearic acid reduced membrane capacitance and abbreviated the action potential duration, likely due to a reduction of the L-type calcium and of the transient outward potassium currents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349218607\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS OF AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over the last decade, a preponderance of evidence suggests a large genetic contribution to atrial fibrillation (AF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/139,140\" class=\"abstract_t\">139,140</a>].

Initially, traditional genetic techniques such as linkage analysis led to the discovery of rare, monogenic causes of AF.&nbsp;The first such study identified a genetic locus for AF using a series of related families with early onset AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].&nbsp;A later study identified the first gene for familial AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. Using a large Chinese kindred with autosomal dominant AF, they found a gain-of-function mutation in&nbsp;KCNQ1&nbsp;(the gene encoding the &alpha; subunit of the potassium channel current, I<sub>Ks</sub>). Since then, several additional gain-of-function variants have been identified in&nbsp;KCNQ1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/144,145\" class=\"abstract_t\">144,145</a>]. In addition to&nbsp;KCNQ1, mutations have been identified in other potassium channels genes, including&nbsp;KCNA5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>],&nbsp;KCND3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>],&nbsp;and&nbsp;KCNJ2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>], and accessory subunits&nbsp;KCNE1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>], KCNE2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>],&nbsp;KCNE3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>],&nbsp;and&nbsp;KCNE5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/152,153\" class=\"abstract_t\">152,153</a>].&nbsp;</p><p>The majority of these functionally validated, AF-associated potassium channel variants have a gain-of-channel function, with an expected shortening of the atrial action potential duration and atrial refractory period. Variation in sodium channel subunits has also been identified as an important factor in the development of familial AF, with AF-causing variants observed in both the major cardiac sodium channel alpha subunit SCN5A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]&nbsp;and its associated beta subunits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/155,156\" class=\"abstract_t\">155,156</a>]. Several variants have also been identified in genes that do not directly alter the atrial action potential, but instead would be expected to cause AF through alternative mechanisms, eg, somatic mutations in&nbsp;<em>GJA5</em>, which encodes the gap junctional protein; connexin 40, a frameshift mutation that resulted in early truncation of NPPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>],&nbsp;which encodes for the precursor for atrial natriuretic peptide;&nbsp;and genetic variation in several developmentally related cardiac transcription factors, ie,&nbsp;NKX2.5,&nbsp;PITX2,&nbsp;GATA4,&nbsp;GATA5<em>,</em>&nbsp;and GATA6<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/156,158,159\" class=\"abstract_t\">156,158,159</a>].</p><p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to identify genetic loci associated with AF. GWAS rely on the unbiased comparison of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the genome, with SNPs occurring with different frequency in individuals with a disease versus controls being used to localize disease-related genetic loci.&nbsp;The first GWAS performed for AF identified a region on chromosome 4q25, which was associated with AF in those of European and Asian descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>]. Subsequently, these findings were broadly replicated in individuals of European,&nbsp;Asian,&nbsp;and African&nbsp;descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/161,162\" class=\"abstract_t\">161,162</a>]. Genetic variants on chromosome 4q25 that are most significantly associated with AF reside about 150 kilobases upstream of the nearest gene <em>PITX2. PITX2</em> encodes the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2, which helps determine cardiac laterality, suppresses the default expression of a sinoatrial nodal gene programme in the left atrium, and specifies the pulmonary venous myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>]. These findings are particularly interesting in light of the fact that AF triggers frequently arise in the pulmonary veins. In addition to the role of <em>PITX2</em> in development, studies demonstrate a role for the PitX2c transcript in expression of gene-encoding ion channels, calcium cycling proteins, and gap junctions; these direct electrophysiological influences likely lead to formation of substrate for triggered activity as well as reentry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>].</p><p>Related analysis identified the same genomic region as being associated with an increased risk of cardioembolic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/156,165\" class=\"abstract_t\">156,165</a>] and a prolonged PR interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/166\" class=\"abstract_t\">166</a>].&nbsp;To date, GWAS have identified 14 genomic regions of susceptibility for AF, with 17 independent signals at these loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/167\" class=\"abstract_t\">167</a>]. These include the <em>ZFHX3</em> gene that encodes a zinc finger homeobox transcription factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>], the <em>KCNN3</em>&nbsp;gene that encodes the SK3 potassium channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>], and the <em>PRRX1</em>&nbsp;gene that encodes a member of the paired-related homeobox gene family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. Whole exome and genome sequencing has been increasingly used to identify rare variants associated with AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. For example, Oleson et al reported a much higher prevalence of rare variants in genes associated with AF (<em>KCNQ1</em>,&nbsp;<em>KCNH2</em>,&nbsp;<em>SCN5A</em>, <em>KCNA5</em>,&nbsp;<em>KCND3</em>,&nbsp;<em>KCNE1</em>,&nbsp;<em>2</em>,&nbsp;<em>5</em>,&nbsp;<em>KCNJ2</em>, <em>SCN1-3B</em>,&nbsp;<em>NPPA</em>, and&nbsp;<em>GJA5</em>) in early onset, lone AF patients than in the background population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/170\" class=\"abstract_t\">170</a>]. This approach is beginning to identify rare candidate variants in genes not previously linked to other types of Mendelian disease<strong> </strong>and thus may offer new insights into AF pathogenesis and disease pathways that could ultimately provide novel therapeutic targets for this common condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11424260\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The precise mechanisms by which age and other risk factors such as hypertension, coronary artery or valvular heart disease, or heart failure increase the propensity for development of atrial fibrillation (AF) are poorly understood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63675 \">figure 1</a>).
