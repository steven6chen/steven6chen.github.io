The ectocervix (surface of the cervix that is visualized on vaginal speculum examination) is covered in squamous epithelium, and the endocervix, including the cervical canal, is covered with glandular epithelium. CIN refers to squamous abnormalities. Glandular cervical neoplasia includes adenocarcinoma in situ and adenocarcinoma.

CIN 2,3 lesions are associated with a high risk of developing cervical cancer, and these are typically treated with cervical excision or ablation. However, there is some chance that these lesions will regress, and observation is used in some patients. This is particularly the case for women who plan future childbearing, since excisional procedures may result in future adverse obstetric outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up#H518651\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Treatment and follow-up&quot;, section on 'Future obstetric risks'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Reproductive effects of treatment&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Treatment is generally performed only based upon histologic results from colposcopically-directed biopsy. In some cases, colposcopy is not adequate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there are recurrent high-grade cytologic findings (atypical squamous cells, cannot rule out high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [ASC-H] or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL]); an excisional procedure is performed for the purpose of diagnosis, but this is the same procedure used for treatment, and further treatment may not be required. In addition, treatment in &quot;see-and-treat&quot; protocols is provided based upon colposcopic appearance of a lesion without confirmation from biopsy result.</p><p>The evaluation approach presented here is provided by the 2012 consensus guidelines of the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology in collaboration with multiple professional societies and government organizations in the United States and Canada, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology, the American Cancer Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the US Food and Drug Administration.

This approach is discussed in detail separately.

The management of women with CIN 1 depends upon the preceding cytology. When CIN 1 is preceded by low-grade cytologic findings (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US] or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [LSIL]), observation is advised rather than treatment, unless CIN 1 persists for two or more years.</p><p>The risk of high-grade preinvasive disease or cancer is higher in women with CIN 1 preceded by a cytologic finding of atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).

This is based upon observational data from the records of a large health maintenance organization, including 20,319 women who underwent colposcopy and had a result of no lesion or CIN 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].<strong> </strong>In women for whom the antecedent screening tests were ASC-US, HPV positive, or LSIL, the five-year risk of CIN 2+ was significantly lower in women who had a single negative cotest (1.1 percent) than those with two sequential negative cytology results (4.0 percent), and was comparable to women with two sequential negative HPV tests (1.8 percent).</p><p>By contrast, some data support use of HPV testing alone rather than <span class=\"nowrap\">HPV/cytology</span> cotesting. Data from the <span class=\"nowrap\">ASC-US/LSIL</span> Triage Study (ALTS) randomized trial included follow-up results for 1539 women with low-grade screening results (ASC-US cytology, HPV-positive, or LSIL cytology) who underwent colposcopy and had no lesion or CIN 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The sensitivity for detection of CIN 2,3 was similar for <span class=\"nowrap\">HPV/cytology</span> cotesting compared with HPV testing alone at 12 months (92 versus 95 percent).

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of CIN differs for women ages 21 to 24 years from that for women 25 and older because CIN often regresses spontaneously in this patient population, and the risk of cervical cancer is low. In addition, some guidelines differ for young women who plan future childbearing, since excisional treatments of the cervix are associated with obstetric risks in future pregnancies.
