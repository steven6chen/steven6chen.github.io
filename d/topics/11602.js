This was illustrated by analyses from the Kids' Inpatient Database that reported increased maternal opiate use from 1.19 to 5.63 per 1000 hospital births from 2000 to 2009, and a rising incidence of NAS from 1.2 to 5.8 per 1000 hospital births per year from 2000 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. An analysis of the State Inpatient Databases of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project from 28 states confirmed the rise of NAS from 1999 to 2013, with an increased incidence from 1.5 to 6.0 per 1000 hospital births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, over a study period from 2004 to 2013, the admission rate to 299 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) rose from 7 to 27 cases per 1000 admissions in the United States with an increase in the median length of stay from 13 to 19 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Among infants with prenatal exposure to opioids, the reported rate of NAS requiring pharmacotherapy ranges from 42 to 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>]. One study using prescription and administrative data linked to vital statistics for mothers and infants enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program between 2009 and 2011 described the strong association between prescription opioid use (opioid pain relievers, and maintenance medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">buprenorphine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methadone</a>) during pregnancy and neonatal complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Antenatal cumulative prescription exposures, type of opioid used, tobacco use, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use increase the risk of NAS. However, there is currently no evidence that there is a relationship between maternal methadone dose and neonatal severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483630858\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of NAS and factors that influence its severity are not completely understood.

However, testing is not typically available on-site at birth hospitals, and results from outside reference laboratories are often not available for days and weeks. Meconium must be collected before the specimen is contaminated by transitional, human milk, or formula stools. In some cases, meconium is passed in utero making collection impossible, and in other cases, it may take several days for the passage of meconium, thereby delaying the diagnosis.

A second concern regarding these scoring tools is the subjective nature of the scales used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Several promising new objective assessment tools that may provide information regarding the severity of NAS in individual infants have been developed.

In patients who continue to display significant NAS signs despite supportive care, we initiate treatment using an oral solution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> sulfate based on predetermined criteria using a neonatal abstinence score system. In our center, the initial dosing is based on severity of signs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55276\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef55276 \">form 1</a>) as opposed to a weight-based protocol used in other institutions, where medication is given on a <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room&quot;, section on 'Naloxone'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5745970\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, a multidisciplinary team of providers, which includes obstetricians, mental health therapists, psychiatrists, pediatricians, nurses, and social workers, provides care for mothers with substance use disorder and their infants. The neonatal management consists of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive measures &ndash; Initial management consists of nonpharmacologic and supportive care that involves the mother during the entire birth hospitalization, for all infants born to mothers with opioid dependence. The response to nonpharmacologic therapy is monitored using an abstinence scoring system that provides ongoing tracking of symptoms and the response to therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55276\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef55276 \">form 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Scoring systems and management protocols'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic therapy &ndash; Pharmacologic therapy is initiated for infants who, despite adequate supportive care, display significant signs of NAS as defined by predetermined criteria based on the abstinence scoring system. The initial preferred pharmacologic therapy is the use of an opioid agent. Although the choice of opioid is dependent on clinician choice, in our center, we use an oral solution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> sulfate with the dosing determined by the overall presence and severity of signs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55276\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef55276 \">form 1</a>). The infant's response to therapy is monitored using the abstinence scoring system. For patients with persistent significant clinical signs, the dose of opioid therapy is increased. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Scoring systems and management protocols'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Opioid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Second medications may be required if the infant's signs are not adequately controlled by single medication therapy. In our center, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonidine</a>. However, other centers may use a sedative agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a>. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Second-drug therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weaning of drug therapy &ndash; Once the patient responds to therapy with a decrease in the number <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severity of signs of withdrawal based on ongoing assessment using the abstinence scoring system, and weight gain is established, medication is weaned.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discharge criteria &ndash; Once the infant has been weaned from medication and has been stable for at least 24 hours, the infant can be discharged. Discharge planning for substance-exposed infants should include an evaluation of maternal functioning and mental health, ongoing maternal substance use disorder treatment, and assessment of the home environment and support systems, with particular attention to any issues with domestic violence and instability. Parents should be educated about SIDS, sleeping positions, postnatal exposures, the importance of ongoing substance use disorder treatment (and mental health care if warranted), signs of infection, and how to access pediatric care and advice if needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up &ndash; Early pediatric follow-up should be arranged prior to hospital discharge in the event that the infant requires re-evaluation for NAS symptoms, or has inadequate weight <span class=\"nowrap\">gain/feeding</span> problems. Pediatric providers should be aware of the potential need for ophthalmologic evaluation for the identification of nystagmus, strabismus, or other refractive errors, and for neurodevelopmental assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been difficult to ascertain the long-term effects of prenatal opioid exposure on the developmental outcome of affected children because of confounding variables. These include prenatal (eg, other drug exposures, prematurity, low birth weight [BW], intrauterine growth restriction [IUGR], etc) and postnatal factors (eg, continued maternal drug use, violence exposure, and socioeconomic and educational level).</p><p>There have been several observational studies that have reported developmental and behavioral problems in both prenatally methadone- and heroin-exposed children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/71-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-74</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An Australian population-based linkage study of births, hospitalization, and death records of all children registered in New South Wales between 2000 and 2011 reported children with NAS were more likely than children without NAS to be rehospitalized for maltreatment, trauma, and mental and behavioral disorders even after accounting for confounding factors (ie, prematurity, maternal age, and socioeconomic status) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a subsequent report using the same population-based linkage database of children registered between 2000 and 2006, children with NAS had poorer mean national test scores than matched controls (gestation, socioeconomic status, and gender) in grades 3, 5, and 7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a systematic review of case-control studies, there were no clinically significant neurobehavioral difference between children exposed to either prenatal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methadone</a> or heroin, although there was a trend to poorer outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. However, this analysis is limited by the low to moderate quality of the included studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subsequent longitudinal study from Norway of 72 children with prenatal opioid and polysubstance exposure, both boys and girls had lower intelligence quotient (IQ) scores at eight years of age than the unexposed group after controlling for earlier cognitive abilities, and for children who were permanently placed in <span class=\"nowrap\">adoptive/foster</span> homes before one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p/><p>Further large studies that control for confounding prenatal and postnatal medical and socioeconomic factors are required to determine whether in utero opioid exposure has an independent adverse effect on development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A newborn infant born to a mother dependent on opioids or other substances is at risk for drug withdrawal, commonly referred to as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). In the United States, opioids to which infants are exposed prenatally include compounds extracted or derived from opium (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">codeine</a>), and semisynthetic derivatives (eg, heroin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methadone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydromorphone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">buprenorphine</a>). (See <a href=\"#H80262073\" class=\"local\">'Opioids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of NAS varies, as the timing and severity of signs depends on the specific opioid, timing of the most recent maternal use of drug before delivery, maternal factors (eg, nutrition, stress, comorbid conditions, and metabolism), genetic predisposition, epigenetic factors, other infant factors (eg, gestational age, comorbid infections, and rate of drug metabolism and excretion), environmental factors, and placental opioid metabolism transfer. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The signs of NAS are due to dysfunction of autonomic regulation, state control capacities, and sensory and motor functioning. They include a high-pitched cry, irritability, <span class=\"nowrap\">sleep/wake</span> disturbances, alterations in tone or movement, feeding difficulties, gastrointestinal and autonomic disturbances, and failure to thrive. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinically verified assessment scoring systems have been developed based on the manifestations of NAS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55276\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef55276 \">form 1</a>). These scoring systems are used to monitor the response of infants to supportive care, and to initiate and monitor response to pharmacologic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of prenatal opioid exposure is clinically based upon a history (or suspected history) of maternal substance use disorder, positive maternal screening for alcohol or drug use, positive maternal or infant urine toxicology screening for opioids or other substances, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neonatal findings that are consistent with NAS. Although a positive opioid identification in either a maternal or neonatal specimen is useful to confirm the diagnosis of NAS, false-negative results often occur in neonatal screening tests for NAS. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other neonatal conditions have similar features to NAS. These include sepsis, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism, polycythemia, and encephalopathy. Careful clinical assessment and diagnostic tests (eg, neonatal screen for NAS, complete blood count and blood cultures for sepsis, or serum blood glucose level for hypoglycemia) help differentiate NAS from these disorders. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5745554\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is unclear whether there are any long-term adverse effects on neurodevelopmental outcome in children who were exposed to prenatal opioids. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Long-term outcome'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of therapy are to establish consistent weight gain and to integrate the infant into an interactive social environment that supports <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> growth and development. (See <a href=\"#H5745546\" class=\"local\">'Goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our management approach, which is provided by a multidisciplinary team, includes the following (see <a href=\"#H5745970\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initial treatment of all substance-exposed infants is supportive (nonpharmacologic) and provided to facilitate the infant's efforts to promote physiologic stability and organization, and competency to interact with <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> environment. These efforts typically include decreasing sensory stimulation, providing adequate nutrition, prevention of skin excoriation, and support for the mother for full participation during the entire birth hospitalization when appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We assess the severity of NAS using a clinically verified scoring system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55276\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef55276 \">form 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Scoring systems and management protocols'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pharmacologic therapy is indicated for infants who, despite adequate supportive care, display significant NAS symptomatology that exceeds predetermined criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55276\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef55276 \">form 1</a>). Therapeutic decisions for initiation and weaning of pharmacologic therapy are based on scoring systems and management protocols that should be developed at each birthing center. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Scoring systems and management protocols'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If pharmacologic treatment is used, we suggest that the initial drug of choice be an opioid agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Methadone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> are the preferred opioid of choice.

(See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Opioid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Second medications may be required if the infant's display is not adequately controlled on single-medication therapy. Choices for second-line drugs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonidine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Second-drug therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infant-mother dyad should also be evaluated and treated for comorbid conditions including maternal sexually transmitted infections and poly use of drugs of substance use disorder (see <a href=\"#H5745554\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> above).
