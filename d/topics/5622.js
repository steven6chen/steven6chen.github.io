The dose is reduced <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dosing interval extended in patients with decreased renal function or as indicated by measured serum drug concentration(s). Extended-interval aminoglycoside therapy (also known as once-daily aminoglycosides, single daily aminoglycoside dosing, consolidated or high-dose aminoglycoside therapy) utilizes a higher weight-based dose administered at an extended interval (every 24 hours for those with normal renal function and longer for those with renal dysfunction). Extended-interval aminoglycoside therapy (utilizing higher single doses) should not be confused with traditional, intermittent dosing with lower individual doses administered at 24-hour intervals because of renal impairment.</p><p>This topic discusses the efficacy and safety, patient selection, and implementation of these two dosing strategies. Other (general) information about aminoglycosides is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminoglycosides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aminoglycosides&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic refers to dosing of aminoglycosides for the treatment of typical bacterial infections. Dosing of aminoglycosides in the treatment of mycobacterial infections, tularemia, plague, and brucella are discussed in the topics dedicated to those infections.</p><p>Of note, for most of these situations, with the exception of urinary tract infections, aminoglycosides are generally used in combination with other agents that have gram-negative activity, regardless of dosing method. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminoglycosides#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aminoglycosides&quot;, section on 'Clinical use'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374424261\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rapid attainment of therapeutic concentrations of aminoglycosides has been correlated with improved patient outcomes. Thus, dosing should be optimized to achieve this effect. Additionally, dosing should be tailored to minimize aminoglycoside toxicity. The following general principles apply to all patients, regardless of whether traditional intermittent versus extended-interval daily dosing strategies are used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial dose and frequency of aminoglycosides is based upon method of administration (ie, traditional intermittent versus extended-interval daily dosing), indication, dosing weight, and renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dosing adjustments should be based upon the results of serum drug concentration monitoring. Targeted peak serum concentrations are intended to take advantage of the pharmacodynamic properties to optimize the potential for efficacy, while specific trough concentrations are targeted to avoid concentration-related toxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous administration of aminoglycosides should occur over at least 30 minutes for traditional intermittent and at least 60 minutes for extended interval dosing. Because beta-lactams inactivate aminoglycosides in vitro, they should <strong>not</strong> be mixed in the same solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the clinical significance of such interactions in vivo is not clear, since the interaction is time and concentration-dependent. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374424569\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in aminoglycoside administration, regardless of method of administration, is determination of the dosing weight. </p><p>Calculation of the dosing weight differs between underweight, average weight, and obese patients. Underweight patients have a total body weight (TBW) less than the ideal body weight (IBW). Obesity is defined as a TBW greater than 125 percent of the IBW. IBW can be estimated by the following formulas and calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-ideal-body-weight-method-of-devine-and-dosing-weight-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IBW, in kg (males) = 50 + (2.3 x inches above 60 inches)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IBW, in kg (females) = 45 + (2.3 x inches above 60 inches)</p><p/><p>For underweight patients, use TBW to calculate dose. </p><p>For patients whose weight is 1 to 1.25 times their IBW, use IBW to calculate dose. </p><p>For obese patients, the dosing weight is calculated as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dosing weight, in kg = IBW + [0.4 x (TBW - IBW)] </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374425388\"><span class=\"h2\">Creatinine clearance estimation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since aminoglycosides are eliminated primarily by glomerular filtration, renal function affects the rate of drug clearance, and thus affects the optimal dosing interval.</p><p>The creatinine clearance can be estimated from the serum creatinine concentration using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-creatinine-clearance-estimate-by-cockcroft-gault-equation-in-adults-and-older-adolescents-age-18-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This formula takes into account the increase in creatinine production with increasing weight and the decline in creatinine production with age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function#H20659769\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;, section on 'Estimation equations'</a>.)</p><p>Any formula estimating the creatinine clearance from the serum creatinine concentration presupposes that the serum creatinine is a stable value. In patients who develop acute renal failure, for example, the low glomerular filtration rate will cause creatinine to be retained and thus lead to an elevation in the serum creatinine concentration. However, until a stable value is reached, the above formula might overestimate the creatinine clearance. Similarly, during recovery from acute renal failure, the fall in serum creatinine concentration will lag behind the improvement in glomerular filtration rate due to the time required for excretion of the retained creatinine.</p><p>Additionally, certain disease states or other factors may alter the relationship between the serum creatinine concentration and creatinine clearance. In particular, creatinine production (and therefore the serum creatinine concentration) is reduced in severe liver disease, malnutrition and significant loss of muscle mass (such as quadriplegic, paraplegic, or amputees), possibly resulting in overestimation of the creatinine clearance with the above formula unless there has been an equivalent reduction in body weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374425859\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring for toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum creatinine concentration should be monitored at baseline and repeated every one to three days, depending upon the individual circumstances. Monitoring for ototoxicity involves subjective patient assessment for the presence of auditory and vestibular dysfunction. The use of objective testing, such as audiometry or electronystagmography, is generally reserved for patients who have subjective symptoms or preexisting auditory dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374424323\"><span class=\"h1\">TRADITIONAL VERSUS EXTENDED-INTERVAL DOSING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral aminoglycosides can be administered using a traditional intermittent dosing strategy, which uses smaller doses given several times each day, or an extended-interval dosing strategy, which uses high doses administered at an extended interval. </p><p>Extended-interval aminoglycoside has efficacy comparable with traditional intermittent administration but offers three potential advantages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Possibility of decreased nephrotoxicity (based on data from animal models)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ease of administration and serum concentration monitoring</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reductions in administration and monitoring-related costs</p><p/><p>Extended-interval dosing of aminoglycosides takes advantage of two pharmacodynamic properties: the post-antibiotic effect and concentration-dependent killing. The post-antibiotic effect refers to the persistent inhibitory effect against many gram-negative aerobic organisms that is seen after drug clearance, and concentration-dependent killing refers to the ability of escalating concentrations of aminoglycosides to induce more rapid killing of the pathogen. These properties are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminoglycosides#H120094867\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aminoglycosides&quot;, section on 'Post antibiotic effect'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminoglycosides#H120094873\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aminoglycosides&quot;, section on 'Concentration-dependent killing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple trials in various adult and pediatric populations evaluating a wide spectrum of infections have demonstrated comparable efficacy of extended-interval dosing with traditional, intermittent dosing aminoglycoside therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/3-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-11</a>]. As an example, in one meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials, extended-interval dosing of aminoglycosides resulted in bacteriologic cure (relative rate 1.02, 95% CI 0.99-1.05) and mortality rates (relative risk 0.91, 95% CI 0.63-1.31) that were comparable to those reported for traditional intermittent dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other meta-analyses in adults and children have demonstrated nonsignificant decreases in antibiotic failure with extended-interval versus traditional dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/4,6,7,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7,10,11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxicity</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Nephrotoxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protection against nephrotoxicity is supported primarily by studies in experimental animals, which suggest that the incidence of acute renal failure is diminished with extended-interval aminoglycoside administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This protective effect is thought to be associated with diminished aminoglycoside accumulation in the renal cortex, suggesting that drug uptake by the proximal tubule is most efficient at low doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The concept of saturable transport of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> observed in rat models may explain how at higher doses, more of the drug is excreted without undergoing tubular reabsorption and therefore without accumulating in and injuring the tubular cells. Higher peaks for shorter periods and a prolonged period of very low exposure may allow for more efficient handling and excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity-and-ototoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and prevention of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With respect to clinical data, three meta-analyses, the last in children, found the following risk ratios for nephrotoxicity with extended-interval dosing relative to conventional, intermittent dosing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.60-1.26 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.54-1.00 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.55-1.69 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p>Thus, in contrast to the animal data, there was no clear evidence of protection against nephrotoxicity with extended-interval dosing in humans. However, there are potentially important limitations to these meta-analyses in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The time period covered by the meta-analyses was similar, but the number of trials included for analysis ranged from 13 to 21, indicating differing methodologies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of trials focused on aminoglycosides other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>. Each meta-analysis included only two trials of gentamicin, the same two in two of the analyses and an additional one in the third. Only one meta-analysis included a study of tobramycin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other antibiotics were administered with aminoglycosides in the majority of trials, including at least one in which the known nephrotoxin amphotericin B was included.</p><p/><p>Individual studies have attempted to address the nephrotoxic potential of extended-interval dosing. A prospective, randomized, double-blind trial performed after the meta-analyses included 74 patients, almost all of whom were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Extended-interval dosing resulted in less nephrotoxicity than twice daily dosing in patients receiving aminoglycosides for at least 72 hours (0 versus 15 percent). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the daily area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and concomitant use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> were significant factors in the development of nephrotoxicity. Experience in patients with cystic fibrosis has also suggested the potential for reduced nephrotoxicity compared with three times daily dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Ototoxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The meta-analyses, the above trial, and other studies did not demonstrate a significant difference in ototoxicity with the two regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/3-7,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7,14,16</a>]. In one meta-analysis, for example, the risk ratio for ototoxicity with extended-interval dosing was 0.67 (95% CI 0.35-1.28) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Nevertheless, the presence or possibility of ototoxicity should be more closely monitored with extended-interval therapy because of the higher peak plasma concentrations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity-and-ototoxicity#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and prevention of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity&quot;, section on 'Ototoxicity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Convenience and cost</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, other potential advantages of extended-interval aminoglycoside therapy relative to traditional intermittent dosing include ease of administration and reduced preparation and administration times. Published reports have confirmed the ability of extended-interval dosing to reduce the costs associated with therapeutic drug monitoring if the monitoring approach suggested below is followed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Extended-interval dosing and monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Furthermore, an extended dosing interval may also help facilitate the transition from inpatient to outpatient care. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTION OF DOSING STRATEGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of comparable efficacy and safety with superior pharmacodynamic profiles and greater ease of administration, extended-interval (instead of traditional intermittent) aminoglycoside dosing is often preferred for patients with suspected or documented moderate to severe infections due to gram-negative aerobic bacteria and among whom this method has been clinically evaluated. These include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/3-11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-11,18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunocompetent, nonpregnant adults and children &gt;3 months of age with:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urinary tract infections </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intraabdominal infections </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory tract infections </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gynecologic infections (including pelvic inflammatory disease) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Soft-tissue infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bacteremia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with postpartum endometritis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Febrile neutropenia patients with malignancy (adults and children) </p><p/><p>Extended-interval dosing strategies have also been evaluated in patients with cystic fibrosis and for synergistic therapy for patients with select serious gram-positive infections. However, typical doses used for these populations are considerably higher and lower (respectively) than those used for other indications. Aminoglycoside dosing for these circumstances are discussed in further detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H374426524\" class=\"local\">'Synergy for gram-positive infections'</a> below.) </p><p>Use of extended-interval dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> (at 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in adults) is an alternative regimen for surgical prophylaxis in select procedures in patients with beta-lactam allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In the setting of CNS or ophthalmologic infections, there are insufficient data to prefer one method of dosing over the other. </p><p>Certain patient groups may have altered aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics (independent of method of dosing) that render extended-interval dosing less useful. Additionally, certain patients may be more likely to have aminoglycoside toxicity when administered at high doses. There has also been a paucity of data among these groups, as they are generally not included in the dosing trials. Thus, we do <strong>not</strong> routinely use extended-interval dosing for the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with burns (&gt;20 percent total body surface area)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ascites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with creatinine clearance less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (including patients requiring dialysis) <strong>OR</strong> &gt;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> </p><p/><p>However, there may be certain indications among such patients for which specific extended-interval dosing strategies have been studied and used. As an example, some experts use extended-interval dosing in the treatment of chorioamnionitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intra-amniotic-infection-clinical-chorioamnionitis-or-triple-i#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intra-amniotic infection (clinical chorioamnionitis or triple I)&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Additionally, some institutions use extended-interval dosing in patients with lower creatinine clearances, with either <span class=\"nowrap\">20ml/min</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">30ml/min</span> as the lower limit. In patients who have a creatinine clearance between this lower limit and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> the calculated aminoglycoside dose is administered at a 48-hour instead of 24-hour interval.</p><p>While patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic or ototoxic agents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prolonged courses of therapy are at greater risk of aminoglycoside toxicity, it is unclear whether or not extended-interval dosing increases the risk of such toxicity (relative to that seen with traditional intermittent dosing). Therefore, while not specifically excluded for eligibility to receive extended-interval dosing, such patients should receive close monitoring.</p><p>Myasthenia gravis is an absolute contraindication to aminoglycoside use, regardless of dosing method used.
