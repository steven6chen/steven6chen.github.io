LAs may be used for neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks, subcutaneous and tissue infiltration, and topical anesthesia. This topic will discuss the mechanism of action of LAs, the properties that distinguish LAs and determine their effects, and the ways in which LAs are used in anesthesia.</p><p>The doses and effects of LAs used for specific regional anesthesia techniques are discussed separately.

Na<sub>v</sub> channels are integral membrane proteins, anchored in the plasma membrane. When local anesthetics bind the sodium channel, they render it impermeable to Na, which prevents action potential initiation and propagation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-local-anesthetics-in-anesthesia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics#H2693192\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and physiology'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3639053136\"><span class=\"h2\">Basic structure/classes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the commonly used local anesthetics have similar structural characteristics and (with the sole exception of articaine) consist of a lipophilic aromatic ring and a hydrophilic tertiary amine. These two moieties are linked by either a carboxylic ester (-CO-) or amide (-NHC-) bond. This linkage determines whether a LA is designated an amino ester or amino amide. Commonly used ester LAs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroprocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroprocaine</a>, procaine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracaine</a>. The commonly used amide LAs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mepivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mepivacaine</a>, and outside the United States, levobupivacaine. Articaine is an amide LA used primarily in dentistry.</p><p>Local anesthetics are weak bases that exist in solution in both charged and uncharged forms. All clinically-used local anesthetics share certain structural features. The aromatic (benzene) ring leads to greater lipid solubility. Lipid solubility declines (and aqueous solubility increases) when the amine nitrogen (at the end of the molecule opposite to the aromatic ring) is protonated (quaternary). When this amine nitrogen is in a tertiary form, it is uncharged and more lipid soluble. The uncharged, more liphophilic form more readily permeates nerve membranes, whereas the charged, more water soluble form binds with greater affinity for the sodium channel. Local anesthetics (save for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzocaine</a>) are supplied by the manufacturer in quaternary form as hydrochloride salts. The proportion of charged and uncharged forms (and, as a consequence, the speed with which they permeate the plasma membrane and produce their clinical effects) is determined by the pKa of the drug, and in vivo, by tissue pH.</p><p>The mechanism of metabolism, and potential for allergic reaction differ between the two classes of LAs. (See <a href=\"#H4256836461\" class=\"local\">'Metabolism of local anesthetics'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4156541190\" class=\"local\">'Allergic reactions'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic reactions to local anesthetics&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3679219362\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCAL ANESTHETIC PHARMACODYNAMICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potency, speed of onset, duration of action, and differential sensory versus motor block in isolated nerves are determined by the physicochemical characteristics of the local anesthetic (LA). In vivo, these characteristics are also affected by the site of injection, drug concentration and volume, technical aspects of nerve block, vasodilatory properties of the drug, and tissue conditions (eg, pH).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3917335018\"><span class=\"h2\">Potency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potency of an LA is primarily determined by lipid solubility, as LAs with greater lipid solubility are able to permeate nerve membranes more readily than less lipid soluble LAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-local-anesthetics-in-anesthesia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> is more lipid soluble than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, and is also more potent, such that 2% lidocaine would be used for epidural anesthesia, versus 0.5% bupivacaine. Local anesthetic molecules with greater molecular weight more readily cross nerve membranes and have a greater affinity for binding the Na channel than smaller LA molecules. As molecular weight increases, so generally does lipid solubility.</p><p>In addition, the larger, more lipid-soluble local anesthetics are more highly protein bound. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2796854636\"><span class=\"h2\">Speed of onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The speed of onset of local anesthetic conduction block depends on the physicochemical properties of the specific drug, the concentration of the solution, and the site of injection. In general, the time to<strong> </strong>onset increases with increasing lipid solubility. All other factors being equal, a more rapid onset is expected when the solution contains a greater fraction of nonionized molecules (eg, at increasing pH). When the dose is held constant, increasing the concentration of the injected local anesthetic has been demonstrated to decrease the time to onset of peripheral nerve block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-local-anesthetics-in-anesthesia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]<strong>. </strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Site of injection </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Onset of anesthesia is almost immediate with subcutaneous or tissue infiltration with any local anesthetic. Onset is also very rapid (ie, within several minutes) with intrathecal injection for spinal anesthesia, because the drug is deposited close to the nerve roots and spinal cord, without having to diffuse through tissue. In contrast, onset of brachial plexus block is prolonged (ie, 20 to 30 minutes), because the drug may be deposited at some distance from the target nerves, and must diffuse through tissues. Ultrasound guidance allows injection of LAs close to target nerves for individual nerve blocks, and may speed onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-local-anesthetics-in-anesthesia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alkalinization </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>When speed of onset is of particular importance for peripheral nerve block or epidural anesthesia, some local anesthetic solutions may be alkalinized with the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, thereby increasing the fraction of nonionized local anesthetic molecules. This strategy is most successfully employed with local anesthetic solutions premixed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> at the factory. These solutions are prepared in a considerably more acidic solution than &quot;plain&quot; local anesthetics to increase the shelf life of the epinephrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-local-anesthetics-in-anesthesia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, 1 and 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with 1:100,000 <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> have a pH of approximately 4. The volume of 8.4% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> required to raise the pH to physiologic range is 1 mL per 10 mL of local anesthetic. At this ratio, the lidocaine solution is unlikely to precipitate which is of concern at higher pH. Plain solutions are packaged at a pH of 6 and further alkalinization does not confer any advantage in onset time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-local-anesthetics-in-anesthesia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alkalinization is generally not used for solutions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a>, as onset times are not consistently shortened, and other LAs would typically be chosen if rapid onset is desirable. Bupivacaine can easily precipitate when alkalinized, and a smaller amount of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> should be added if it is used (ie, 0.1 mL of bicarbonate per 10 mL of bupivacaine).

The more potent local anesthetics are the longest-persisting, most likely because their increased lipid solubility leads to slower uptake and removal by the blood stream.</p><p>In vivo, the duration of action of a specific LA varies widely, and is affected by other factors, including the intrinsic vascular effects of the specific drug, concentration of the LA, protein binding, metabolism of the drug, local tissue conditions, and the site of injection. As an example, spinal anesthesia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> resolves over approximately 2.5 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108422 \">table 2</a>), whereas single injection brachial plexus block with bupivacaine can result in 5 to 15 hours of anesthesia, and up to 30 hours of analgesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F93203\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93203 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2368018785\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential blockade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nerve fiber characteristics that lead to differing susceptibility to local anesthetic conduction block include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For nerve fibers with a relatively small diameter, a lower concentration of LA is required to achieve blockade than for a larger diameter fiber of the same type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-local-anesthetics-in-anesthesia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A shorter length of exposure to LA is required to block smaller fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-local-anesthetics-in-anesthesia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myelinated fibers require exposure of three or more adjacent nodes of Ranvier to LA for successful block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-local-anesthetics-in-anesthesia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p>On the other hand, in general and based on animal studies, unmyelinated (C) fibers are more resistant to inhibition by LAs than many myelinated fibers even though myelinated fibers are larger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-local-anesthetics-in-anesthesia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Nerve blocks in the clinical setting typically impair sympathetic function most expeditiously, followed by loss of sensation to sharp pain, temperature, and then pressure. Motor function is typically lost last. As a consequence, after local anesthetic injection for a nerve block, sympathectomy with vasodilation is often the first marker of a successful block. As the block develops, painful sensations will be blocked before motor function is lost. Differences in onset between motor and sensory function are more apparent with some local anesthetics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a>) than with others (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mepivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mepivacaine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>). Spinal and epidural anesthesia will demonstrate zones of differential block at the uppermost dermatomes of block, where one can observe clearly more widespread inhibition of cold sensation versus pinprick sensation.

High serum levels can cause both minor signs and symptoms of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) (eg, perioral numbness, metallic taste, mental status changes or anxiety, visual changes), or major LAST events (ie, seizures or cardiac arrest) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-local-anesthetics-in-anesthesia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Local anesthetics bind to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha1-acid glycoprotein and secondarily to albumin. The fraction of protein binding of local anesthetic molecules in the blood increases with the drug's hydrophobicity. Importantly, acidosis decreases the degree of protein binding by increasing the fraction of protonated local anesthetic molecules, thereby enhancing the unbound fraction of the drug. This is one of the reasons that acidosis must be avoided during treatment of local anesthetic systemic toxicity, since the unbound drug produces systemic toxic effects.

They are not evidence based, and don't take into account the site or technique of LA administration, or patient factors that increase the risk of toxicity. Systemic toxicity may occur with doses within the recommended ranges, while doses in excess of the recommended maximums have been administered without toxicity. Nonetheless, published maximum recommended doses can be used as a starting point for deciding on a dose. The total dose of local anesthetic administered should be the lowest dose that is required for the desired extent and duration of block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F93203\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93203 \">table 1</a>).
