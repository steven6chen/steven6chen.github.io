Both volatile acids (carbonic acid) and nonvolatile acids (noncarbonic or organic acids) are produced. The major buffers utilized by the fetus for neutralizing hydrogen ion production are plasma bicarbonate and hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Inorganic phosphates and erythrocyte bicarbonate are also potential buffers, although they play a lesser role in fetal acid-base homeostasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17035538\"><span class=\"h2\">Acids and buffers</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carbonic acid</strong> &ndash; The fetus produces carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) during oxidative metabolism (aerobic glycolysis). Since H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is formed primarily from carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) via hydration in the presence of erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase, the formation of H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>is equivalent to CO<sub>2</sub> generation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The rate of CO<sub>2</sub> production, in turn, is equivalent to the rate of fetal oxygen consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For the most part, the fetus can handle the amount of H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>produced daily from aerobic metabolism since H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> dissociates to water and CO<sub>2</sub>, which readily diffuses across the placenta. Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> across the placenta is facilitated by a lower maternal alveolar and arterial CO<sub>2</sub> (PCO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub>) during pregnancy, secondary to hyperventilation. Retention of CO<sub>2</sub> (hypercarbia) leads to respiratory acidemia (low pH with high PCO<sub>2</sub> and normal bicarbonate concentration). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lactate</strong> &ndash; Lactate is a direct end product of anaerobic metabolism and predictive of short-term neonatal morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Organic acids</strong> &ndash; Fetal hypoxia can occur when maternal oxygenation is compromised (eg, respiratory disease), maternal perfusion of the placenta is reduced (eg, preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, <span class=\"nowrap\">hypotension/hypovolemia,</span> cyanotic heart disease), or delivery of oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus is impeded (eg, placental abruption, cord compression). When adequate fetal oxygenation does not occur, complete oxidative metabolism of carbohydrates to CO<sub>2</sub> and water is impaired and metabolism proceeds along an anaerobic pathway with production of organic acids, such as lactic acid and ketoacids. In contrast to carbonic acid, organic acids are not readily excreted or metabolized and are cleared very slowly across the placenta; therefore, they accumulate in the fetus. Mixed acidemia (low pH with low bicarbonate concentration and high PCO<sub>2</sub>) or metabolic acidemia (low pH with normal PCO<sub>2</sub> and low bicarbonate concentration) develops when accumulation of organic acids depletes the buffer system to critically low levels of buffers. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Buffers</strong> &ndash; The fetus utilizes many different buffers to maintain pH in a very narrow range as very small changes in pH may significantly affect function of major fetal organ systems, such as the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The two major buffers are bicarbonate and hemoglobin; inorganic phosphates, erythrocyte bicarbonate, and albumin play a lesser role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The placenta also plays a significant role in helping to maintain a bicarbonate pool and buffering the fetus against changes in maternal pH or blood gas status. In a study using a perfused human placental model, acidification of the maternal side of the circulation did not significantly alter fetal acid-base status and there was efflux of bicarbonate from the placenta into the maternal circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The bicarbonate concentration is important in defining base deficit and base excess. A base deficit (or negative base excess) exists when the fetal serum bicarbonate concentration is below normal. A base excess exists when the fetal bicarbonate concentration is above normal; however, alkalemia at birth is rare and always&nbsp;secondary to&nbsp;maternal abnormalities. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17035701\"><span class=\"h2\">Differences from postnatal acid-base physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although fetal acid-base physiology is similar to that of the newborn, there are notable differences. Fetal physiology is characterized by inability to compensate for acidemia by compensatory respiratory or renal responses in the same way and to the same degree as in the newborn.</p><p>The kidneys and lungs play significant roles in maintaining acid-base balance in postnatal life, and respiratory and metabolic acidosis are the result of distinct clinical conditions. As an example, postnatally, pulmonary disorders such as asthma, interstitial lung disease, or hypoventilation can lead to respiratory acidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Likewise, diabetes mellitus, renal tubular acidosis, or diarrhea can lead to metabolic acidemia. By comparison, the fetus depends primarily upon the placenta to act as lungs (with respect to provision of oxygen and clearance of carbon dioxide) and, to a lesser degree, kidneys to help compensate for acidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. Uteroplacental hypoperfusion is the major cause of both respiratory and metabolic acidemia in the fetus, with progression from the former to the latter over time if decreased uteroplacental blood flow is not corrected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70673\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70673 \">figure 1</a>). Although the fetus can manifest a blood gas profile in a respiratory or metabolic pattern, acidosis most likely represents a continuum (mixed acidosis) rather than a distinct clinical entity. As an example, if uteroplacental perfusion is corrected during the respiratory phase, respiratory acidosis resolves as CO<sub>2</sub> is rapidly cleared across the placenta. However, if the pathologic process is protracted, then in addition to impairment of CO<sub>2 </sub>excretion, organic acids are produced and cleared very slowly across the placenta so that metabolic acidosis develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR FETAL ACID-BASE ANALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus about when to perform umbilical cord blood acid-base analysis and no evidence that routinely measuring pH and blood gases at birth is cost-effective. Based on available evidence, it is reasonable for clinicians and obstetrical units to establish their own sampling policies.</p><p>Recommendations from the United Kingdom and the United States are summarized below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives recommend cord blood acid-base analysis in all cesarean or operative vaginal deliveries performed because of fetal compromise, and consideration of cord blood acid-base analysis in all deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], a practice followed by some clinicians in the United States as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that umbilical artery blood acid-base analysis should be performed after any delivery in which a fetal metabolic abnormality is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some examples for performing such testing include any delivery with low Apgar scores (&lt;5 at 5 minutes and 10 minutes), a category III fetal heart rate pattern, low birth weight, or maternal intrapartum fever. Acid-base assessment can be valuable in these cases because these neonates are at increased risk of an adverse outcome, but only a minority is acidotic at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/2,6,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,8-11</a>]. Thus, this information provides evidence that any observed adverse outcome is likely related to factors other than prolonged intrapartum hypoxia and acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H390551558\"><span class=\"h1\">SETTING ASIDE A SEGMENT OF CORD PREEMPTIVELY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A section of the umbilical cord can be clamped and set aside at delivery in cases of possible neonatal depression, such as meconium-stained amniotic fluid, fetal growth restriction, breech delivery, multiple gestation, category II fetal heart rate pattern, preterm delivery, or abruptio placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Subsequent measurement of pH and gases is performed only if clinically indicated because of poor neonatal status in the delivery room (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> below). Delayed umbilical cord clamping does not necessarily preclude the subsequent collection of a sample of cord blood for measurement of pH and gases. (See <a href=\"#H3438000216\" class=\"local\">'Can cord blood analysis be performed after delayed cord clamping?'</a> below.)</p><p>However, the benefits of access to information about fetal acid-base status must be balanced against the loss of any newborn benefits from placental transfusion since transfusion volume will be reduced with early cord clamping (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of normal labor and delivery&quot;, section on 'Cord clamping'</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3636205457\"><span class=\"h2\">Umbilical artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sampling umbilical artery blood is preferable to sampling umbilical vein blood as the arterial pH and base deficit provide the most accurate information on fetal acid-base status and correlate best with newborn morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/1,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14,15</a>].

Blood is drawn from the umbilical artery into a 1 to 2 mL syringe (preferably glass), which has been flushed with heparin, and the syringe is immediately transported on ice to the laboratory. As with maternal arterial blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], most studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>], have found that a cord blood sample prepared in this way is reasonably stable for assessment of both pH and base deficit for 60 minutes. Ideally, the test is performed as soon as possible after delivery; however, a sample may be obtained immediately but held on ice until a decision is made for or against these tests.</p><p>Arterial pH and base deficit at birth can be determined from testing a blood sample obtained from a clamped umbilical cord segment kept at room temperature for no more than 20 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If more than 20 minutes have elapsed, the values can be estimated from testing a blood sample obtained from a clamped umbilical cord up to 90 minutes after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The estimate is based on studies reporting the rate of fall of pH over time (eg, cord pH falls 0.05 at 30 minutes, 0.087 at 60 minutes, and 0.112 at 90 minutes after birth). </p><p>If obtaining umbilical cord artery blood samples is difficult, the vessels on the fetal surface of the placenta can be utilized (&quot;arteries cross over veins&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115437\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115437 \">picture 1</a>)) and will provide similar, but not necessarily equivalent, results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/17,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,26,27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1594281789\"><span class=\"h2\">Can umbilical venous blood be used?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal umbilical vein pH is higher than umbilical artery pH (7.25 to 7.45 versus 7.18-7.38 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]). A sample from the umbilical vein should be sent if an umbilical artery sample cannot be obtained.

Umbilical artery pH with a metabolic component is a strong predictor of neonatal outcome with an increased risk of neonatal morbidity or mortality; respiratory acidosis is not usually associated with complications in the newborn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/8,43,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,43,58</a>]. The duration of neonatal metabolic acidosis after delivery is also an important prognostic factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Even though newborns with metabolic acidosis are at risk for a worse prognosis than those without metabolic acidosis, most newborns with metabolic acidosis still have a good prognosis. In a study of 1265 neonates with metabolic acidosis (umbilical artery pH &lt;7.0 and base deficit &ge;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> 98 percent had no intracranial hemorrhage, 94 percent had no seizures within 24 hours of birth, and 86 percent had no respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

As discussed above, consideration of the base deficit is useful for interpretation of umbilical artery pH because an increase in base deficit distinguishes acidosis with a metabolic component (low pH, low bicarbonate concentration) from respiratory acidosis (low pH, normal bicarbonate concentration). </p><p>The base deficit has a linear relationship with lactic acid accumulation and correlates with the risk of neonatal neurologic morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An umbilical artery base deficit &ge;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> which is &gt;2 standard deviations above the mean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], is commonly accepted as a reasonable threshold for predicting an increased risk of moderate or severe newborn complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/8,41,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,41,61,62</a>]. A base deficit of 12 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> is associated with an increase in infant mortality, moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy, multiorgan failure, and long-term neurologic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/15,61,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,61,63,64</a>]. In one study, moderate or severe complications occurred in 10 percent of newborns with umbilical artery base deficit 12 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> and in 40 percent of those &gt;16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p>Whether base deficit in acidemic infants at term is an independent marker for neonatal morbidity and mortality has been questioned. In one study, for example, base deficit did not provide any additional prognostic information over pH alone, suggesting that the poor neonatal outcomes associated with a greater base deficit may just mirror the lower pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. A limitation of this study was the lack of a cohort of nonacidemic infants with an elevated base deficit.</p><p>It has been estimated that fetal stress characterized by repetitive moderate or severe variable decelerations may increase the base deficit by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> per 30 minutes; repetitive late or severe atypical variable decelerations (subacute fetal compromise) may increase the base deficit by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> per 6 to 15 minutes; and terminal bradycardia (eg, from ruptured uterus, major abruption, or complete cord occlusion) may increase the base deficit by as much as 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> per two to three minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. By comparison, an uncomplicated labor results in a 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> change in base deficit over many hours ( the average umbilical artery base deficit at vaginal delivery is 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. However, many factors affect the fetal response to hypoxia; these include an acute versus chronic process, presence of <span class=\"nowrap\">hypotension/hypoperfusion,</span> preterm versus term fetus, presence of anemia or functional cardiovascular anomalies.</p><p>It is important to note that base deficit is calculated from pH and PCO<sub>2</sub> using an algorithm and that blood gas analyzers do not use a universal standard algorithm for this calculation. Studies have shown that the base deficit value reported by a laboratory is impacted by the fetal fluid compartment sampled (blood, extracellular fluid), choice of algorithm, and brand of blood gas analyzer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/62,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,65</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1865287\"><span class=\"h2\">Lactate levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The umbilical artery lactate concentration has also been used as a marker of fetal metabolic acidosis. Lactate can be measured using a handheld meter at the point-of-care or by a blood gas machine in the laboratory. The mean umbilical artery lactate level after a normal delivery has been reported to range from 2.55 to 4.63 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> but data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/4,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,66</a>]. Differences in calibration of blood gas meters may explain the variation in mean lactate values.</p><p>Routine assessment of umbilical artery lactate levels is not recommended given the poor predictive value of newborn outcome. The threshold lactate concentration predictive of adverse short-term neonatal outcome is controversial and depends on the specimen (hemolyzed or whole blood) and the lactate meter used. The significant variability introduced by measurement and assay parameters limits the clinical utility of lactate measures in cord samples. An appropriate threshold is difficult to identify because of the low frequency of neonatal encephalopathy.&nbsp;In one of the largest series (28 validated cases &gt;23 weeks), umbilical artery lactate 5.70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> had sensitivity and specificity of 69 and 88 percent for the outcome of moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Using a broad composite endpoint (neonatal intubation, mechanical ventilation, meconium aspiration syndrome, encephalopathy, hypothermic therapy, or death), a prospective study including 56 term neonates with this composite endpoint concluded the optimal umbilical artery threshold for predicting serious neonatal morbidity was 3.90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> with sensitivity and specificity of 84 and 74 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. At this threshold, umbilical artery lactate level performed better than pH 7.25 for predicting the composite outcome. In both studies, however, lactate levels were poor predictors of neonatal encephalopathy. A systematic review that evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of umbilical artery lactate reported sensitivity and specificity for prediction of poor neurological outcome was 70 and 93 percent, respectively, but the analysis was limited by the broad differences in study methodologies (eg, variation in thresholds for defining acidosis, variation in definitions of neonatal outcome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>Umbilical venous lactate levels have also been evaluated as a marker for fetal metabolic acidosis&nbsp;as umbilical venous blood is&nbsp;more&nbsp;readily available than umbilical artery blood. In a prospective study of almost 8000 consecutive singleton births at term with no anomalies, the umbilical venous lactate concentration was predictive of umbilical artery lactic acidemia defined as &gt;3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. An umbilical venous lactate level of 3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> was the optimal value in predicting both arterial lactic acidemia and a composite neonatal outcome defined as neonatal demise and any neonatal morbidities including intubation, mechanical ventilation, meconium aspiration syndrome, neonatal encephalopathy, and therapeutic hypothermia. Although predictive of arterial lactic acidemia, umbilical venous lactate is no better for predicting neonatal morbidity. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111864303\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoxemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of umbilical artery PO<sub>2</sub> has no apparent clinical utility as a low PO<sub>2</sub> level is not an independent risk factor for neonatal morbidity or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Rarely, alterations in maternal acid-base balance, such as renal tubular acidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis, result in fetal acidosis.

In contrast to carbonic acid, organic acids are not readily excreted or metabolized and are cleared very slowly across the placenta; therefore, they accumulate in the fetus. Mixed acidemia (low pH with low bicarbonate concentration and high PCO<sub>2</sub>) or metabolic acidemia (low pH with normal PCO<sub>2</sub> and low bicarbonate concentration) develops when accumulation of organic acids depletes the buffer system to critically low levels of buffers. (See <a href=\"#H17035504\" class=\"local\">'Fetal acid-base physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Umbilical artery blood acid-base analysis should be performed after any delivery in which a fetal metabolic abnormality is suspected, such as any delivery with low Apgar scores (&lt;5 at 5 minutes and 10 minutes), a category III fetal heart rate pattern, low birth weight, or maternal intrapartum fever. These neonates are at increased risk of an adverse outcome, but only a minority are acidotic at delivery. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for fetal acid-base analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A section of the umbilical cord can be clamped and set aside at delivery in cases of possible neonatal depression, such as meconium-stained amniotic fluid, fetal growth restriction, breech delivery, multiple gestation, category II fetal heart rate pattern, preterm delivery, or abruptio placenta. However, the benefits of access to information about fetal acid-base status must be balanced against the loss of any newborn benefits from placental transfusion since transfusion volume will be reduced with early cord clamping. Measurement of pH and gases is subsequently performed only if clinically indicated because of poor neonatal status in the delivery room. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for fetal acid-base analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If acid-base analysis is planned, the cord should be clamped as soon as possible after birth. The blood specimen is collected in a syringe flushed with heparin and obtained from the umbilical artery of a doubly-clamped segment of umbilical cord. A cord blood sample prepared in this way is reasonably stable for assessment of both pH and base deficit for 60 minutes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal pH is normally 0.1 units lower than maternal pH. The mean normal umbilical arterial blood pH and gas values for premature infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69589\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69589 \">table 1</a>) and term infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50916\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50916 \">table 2</a>) are almost identical.

A pH &lt;7.00 is a practical threshold for defining pathologic fetal acidemia. Although respiratory acidosis is not usually associated with complications in the newborn, a base deficit greater &ge;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> suggests metabolic acidosis and is associated with an increased risk of moderate or severe newborn complications.
