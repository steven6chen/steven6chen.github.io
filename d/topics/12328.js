Although cerebellar degeneration may be chronic and slowly progressive, acute cerebellar swelling due to infarction, edema, or hemorrhage can have rapid and catastrophic effects and is a true neurological emergency. Here we set out to briefly describe the <span class=\"nowrap\">clinical/anatomic</span> correlates of cerebellar disease, to provide a broad differential diagnosis for patients who present with cerebellar ataxia, and to provide a methodological approach to the evaluation of patients with cerebellar signs. A special emphasis is placed on causes of cerebellar ataxia, both acquired and genetic, that are reversible when timely therapy is initiated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17305672\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL AND ANATOMIC CORRELATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomy of the cerebellum in the posterior fossa of the intracranial cavity is complex, but it can be separated into three major structures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The midline cerebellum, which includes the cerebellar vermis, the fastigial and interposed (globus and emboliform) nuclei, the vestibulocerebellum (composed of the flocculus and nodulus), and the <span class=\"nowrap\">paravermis/intermediate</span> zone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two large cerebellar hemispheres, including the dentate nuclei</p><p/><p>Cerebellar syndromes can be divided into symptoms arising from damage to the midline structures or hemispheric structures, although there is significant clinical overlap between these syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17305679\"><span class=\"h2\">Midline cerebellar structures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The midline cerebellar structures are critical for motor execution, rapid and slow eye movements, <span class=\"nowrap\">balance/lower</span> extremity coordination, and vestibular function. Damage to the midline of the cerebellum tends to produce gait ataxia and imbalance, truncal ataxia, dysmetria, ocular findings, head bobbing, and vertigo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As manifestations of gait ataxia and imbalance, patients with midline cerebellar lesions tend to fall when standing with their feet together whether their eyes are opened or closed. They often have difficulties with gait, especially tandem gait. They may complain of a sensation of disequilibrium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Truncal ataxia can result in the inability of patients to sit unsupported by their arms. This is seen more often in severe midline injuries and can be associated with some degree of titubation or swaying of the head and trunk. Patients with midline cerebellar syndromes can also have bilateral upper limb ataxia, especially if the <span class=\"nowrap\">paravermis/intermediate</span> zone region of the cerebellum is damaged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysmetria refers to an impaired ability to perform accurate movements during goal-directed tasks because of a faulty estimation of distance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It can be seen with both midline and hemispheric cerebellar lesions. With midline cerebellar lesions, dysmetria may predominantly affect the lower extremities, and can be elicited on heel-to-shin testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common ocular abnormality is saccadic intrusions, which are irregular bursts of rapid eye movements that include opsoclonus, ocular flutter, square wave jerks, and macrosaccadic oscillations. These most often but not always result from cerebellar lesions. Another common ocular abnormality is horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nystagmus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nystagmus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jerk-nystagmus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jerk nystagmus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pendular-nystagmus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pendular nystagmus&quot;</a>). Often the nystagmus is more prominent when looking towards the side of the lesion, although nystagmus in all directions of gaze is usually present. Up-beating nystagmus present in primary gaze or induced by up gaze is localizing to the cerebellar flocculus, as is rebound nystagmus, which is the induction of nystagmus upon return to primary gaze. Both of these can be seen in other processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Down-beating nystagmus can be seen with midline cerebellar vermis lesions as well as in cervicomedullary junction lesions. Ocular dysmetria is the term applied to hypermetric saccadic eye movements. After overshooting, the eyes rapidly correct their position to focus appropriately on the object in question. This finding is very suggestive of cerebellar dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertigo with nausea and vomiting may result from damage to the vestibulocerebellum and is usually associated with the ocular findings listed above.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17305686\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebellar hemispheres</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cerebellar hemispheres are largely concerned with motor planning and coordination of complex tasks. Damage to one hemisphere leads to symptoms that are most notable in the ipsilateral limbs. The clinical signs most commonly seen include dysdiadochokinesis, dysmetria, limb ataxia, intention tremor, and scanning speech.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysdiadochokinesis, which is incoordination when performing rapid alternating movements, is a common finding in cerebellar disease. Specific testing includes having the patient alternately pronate and supinate the forearm and hand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysmetria of the hands and arms, including past-pointing on finger to nose testing. Dysmetria is also commonly seen in the legs leading to some degree of gait ataxia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limb ataxia is usually seen clinically as difficulty with coordinated tasks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intention tremor, also called kinetic tremor, typically increases in severity as the hand moves closer to its target and is usually large in amplitude.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scanning speech refers to slow, slurred, monotonous, and irregular speech that is associated with dysarthria due to oral motor ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular findings are generally less prominent, but broken smooth pursuits and ipsilateral gaze-evoked nystagmus are often seen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17305693\"><span class=\"h2\">Noncerebellar causes of ataxia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weakness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sensory loss (both tactile and visual) are common causes of falls and can simulate features of cerebellar ataxia. Moreover, the presence of proprioceptive deficits can significantly worsen cerebellar ataxia that would otherwise be subclinical.</p><p>A number of other processes, including hydrocephalus and vestibular disease, also can produce clinical pictures similar to cerebellar ataxia and therefore need to be ruled out as part of the evaluation. While dizziness and vertigo are commonly seen in cerebellar disease, especially when the vestibulocerebellum is damaged, they rarely occur in isolation as the result of a cerebellar lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-dizziness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with dizziness&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with vertigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17305700\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many different etiologies for cerebellar disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F90074\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90074 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F90077\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90077 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>When approaching a patient with cerebellar ataxia, the first major fork in the clinical decision tree is the temporal onset of the symptoms. We have therefore subdivided the discussion below into acute (seconds to days), subacute (days to weeks), and chronic (months to years) ataxias. For chronic and episodic ataxias, a second division into familial or apparently sporadic is also helpful.</p><p>The diagnosis of an underlying cause in patients presenting with ataxia is an imperfect science. Clinical experience at medical centers that see large numbers of patients with ataxia demonstrates that between 10 and 15 percent of patients who present with apparently sporadic progressive ataxia are found eventually to have a hereditary cause of their symptoms. Moreover, many of the etiologies listed below as having acute or subacute onset can sometimes present over a longer time course and therefore still need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with a chronic progressive ataxia. Perhaps most sobering is that a cause was not found it up to half of all cases of ataxia in one large case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and our own experience mirrors these studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17305707\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE ATAXIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of an acute cerebellar ataxia occurs over a period of minutes to hours and is considered a medical emergency. The most common causes of acute ataxia are toxins, medications, infections, and ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17305714\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebellar ischemia and hemorrhage are important causes of acute ataxia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cerebellar ischemia </strong>can result from multiple mechanisms affecting the vertebrobasilar arterial system, including embolism, thrombosis, dissection, and vasculitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-circulation-cerebrovascular-syndromes#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior circulation cerebrovascular syndromes&quot;, section on 'Cerebellar infarction'</a>). In most cases, occlusion of the vertebral arteries, basilar artery, or the major branches feeding the cerebellar hemispheres results in ipsilateral limb ataxia and, in cases of damage to midline cerebellar structures, nystagmus, imbalance, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. In addition, there can be associated brainstem findings that vary depending on the site of the lesion. Intermittent cerebellar ataxia can be seen with vertebrobasilar insufficiency. In such cases, symptoms may worsen with positional changes. The Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex are highly sensitive to anoxic injury and, as such, can be affected by global hypoperfusion or <span class=\"nowrap\">hypoxic/ischemic</span> injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cerebellar hemorrhage</strong> may result from a number of etiologies, including hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic infarction, hypertensive hemorrhage, aneurysmal rupture, and bleeding from arteriovenous malformation. Most cerebellar hemorrhages are seen in midline structures (ie, the dentate nucleus and less frequently the cerebellar vermis) and thus, midline cerebellar symptoms are common.</p><p/><p>Cerebellar ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are commonly associated with headache and can be complicated by swelling of the cerebellum. This swelling can lead to compression of the adjacent brainstem and the fourth ventricle, resulting in hydrocephalus from compression of cerebrospinal fluid outflow through the fourth ventricular foramina and eventually downward herniation and death if left untreated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-circulation-cerebrovascular-syndromes#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior circulation cerebrovascular syndromes&quot;, section on 'Pseudotumoral cerebellar infarction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cerebellar hemorrhage'</a>). This makes any vascular injury to the cerebellum a neurologic emergency requiring rapid imaging, aggressive monitoring, and potentially surgical intervention to achieve the best outcomes. When the cerebellum is the only structure damaged, patients can achieve a near full recovery of function if the acute swelling and compression issues can be overcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17305728\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications and toxins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications and toxins can lead to transient or permanent cerebellar ataxia and should be explored in most patients where an etiology is not readily apparent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F90077\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90077 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antiepileptic drugs</strong>, especially those that effect sodium channel conductance such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, are associated with ataxia.

Effects are usually reversible when the medicine is stopped, but chronic administration of phenytoin in particular can lead to permanent cerebellar degeneration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> can be associated with both reversible and permanent cerebellar ataxia. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cytarabine</a>, often used in treatment of leukemias and lymphomas, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a>, which is used in various cancer treatments including colon cancer therapy, are the most common chemotherapeutics associated with acute cerebellar ataxia. High doses of cytarabine cause an acute cerebellar syndrome in 10 to 25 percent of patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-non-platinum-cancer-chemotherapy#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neurologic complications of non-platinum cancer chemotherapy&quot;, section on 'Cytarabine'</a>). An acute cerebellar syndrome occurs rarely in patients receiving fluorouracil; the ataxia associated with fluorouracil may not develop until weeks to months after the chemotherapy has been administered (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-non-platinum-cancer-chemotherapy#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neurologic complications of non-platinum cancer chemotherapy&quot;, section on 'Fluorouracil'</a>). Additional chemotherapeutic agents that may be associated with acute cerebellar ataxia include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a>, hexamethylmelamine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and other vinca alkaloids. As a separate issue, certain chemotherapeutic agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neurologic complications of platinum-based chemotherapy&quot;</a>), are associated with the development of sensory ataxia caused by neurotoxicity affecting dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toxins and poisons</strong> associated with cerebellar ataxia include alcohol, carbon tetrachloride, heavy metals, phencyclidine, and toluene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F90077\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90077 \">table 2</a>). Perhaps the most common cause of acute onset cerebellar ataxia is excessive alcohol ingestion, which usually produces a midline cerebellar syndrome, characterized by ataxia of legs and gait with relative sparing of the arms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17305735\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of infectious etiologies are linked to the development of acute cerebellar ataxia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F90074\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90074 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Meningoencephalitis</strong> can produce symptoms of cerebellar ataxia with or without encephalopathy. Affected patients often have headache, neck stiffness, and fever, depending on the inciting agent. However, a pure cerebellar ataxia as the only symptom can be seen, especially in certain viral infections. Possible viral pathogens include varicella zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus (among many others), and bacterial etiologies include typical (streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitis) and atypical (Lyme, listeria, mycoplasma, tuberculosis, malaria) bacterial agents. The diagnosis is established by lumbar puncture. Treatment and recovery are dependent on the underlying infectious agent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postinfectious cerebellitis</strong> is a condition classically seen between one and six weeks after varicella or measles infections in children, but can also occur after Epstein-Barr or other viral infections and vaccinations in teenagers and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Brain MRI studies may be normal or can demonstrate diffusion and T2-weighted cerebellar hemispheric abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The exact mechanism of the autoimmune response is unclear, but some cases are associated with autoantibody production (molecular mimicry). Postinfectious cerebellitis is usually a monophasic illness that has complete resolution regardless of treatment, but it can be complicated by cerebellar edema requiring interventions such as glucocorticoid treatment, surgical decompression, or ventriculoperitoneal shunting for hydrocephalus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17305742\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBACUTE ATAXIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of subacute ataxias is typically on the order of days to weeks, with progression occurring over weeks to months rather than years. There is significant variability in the time course of these disorders, such that they can sometimes present in an acute or chronic fashion. Etiologies include atypical infections, chronic exposure to toxins or medications, alcohol abuse and vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, systemic metabolic disorders, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, and neoplasms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3280704\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical infectious agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atypical infectious agents that can cause a subacute cerebellar ataxia include progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, prion disease, and Whipple disease among others.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy</strong> (PML) is caused by reactivation of the JC virus in immunocompromised hosts. As the name implies, classic PML is progressive, multifocal, and involves the white matter. PML usually manifests with subacute neurologic deficits including altered mental status, motor deficits (hemiparesis or monoparesis), limb ataxia, gait ataxia, and visual symptoms such as hemianopia and diplopia. It can present with a progressive cerebellar syndrome caused by PML lesions in the cerebellar white matter, often with brainstem involvement. In addition to classic PML, JC virus may cause infection of cerebellar granule cell neurons (JC virus granule cell neuronopathy), leading to ataxia and cerebellar atrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Neuroimaging with MRI in patients with PML reveals a multifocal process limited to the white matter that does not conform to vascular territories and exhibits neither mass effect nor contrast enhancement. The diagnosis of PML can usually be established by polymerase chain reaction detection of JC virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)<br/><br/>There is no specific treatment for PML, but management is directed at reversing the immunocompromised state. In patients with HIV who have not been on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), initiation of treatment can be associated with an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome that can lead to increased edema and transient worsening of the clinical symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prion diseases</strong> are often associated with cerebellar ataxia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diseases of the central nervous system caused by prions&quot;</a>). Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most frequent of the human prion diseases. Rapidly progressive mental deterioration and myoclonus are the two cardinal clinical manifestations of sporadic CJD. Cerebellar ataxia and extrapyramidal signs such as hypokinesia are also common. MRI signal hyperintensities on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences are typically seen in the putamen and head of the caudate; diffusion-weighted sequences are the most sensitive MRI technique for demonstrating &quot;cortical ribboning&quot; pattern of increased signal in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. An elevated cerebrospinal fluid level of the neuronal protein 14-3-3, a marker of rapid neuronal death, is found in most patients, but may be within normal limits early in the course of the disease, and the sensitivity of this test is suboptimal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=creutzfeldt-jakob-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>CJD and other prion diseases are inexorably progressive over the course of weeks to months and are currently without effective treatment.

It is characterized clinically by arthralgias, weight loss, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, often with steatorrhea. Neurologic involvement affects a minority and most often manifests with cognitive change, altered consciousness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a supranuclear gaze palsy, but cerebellar ataxia and degeneration can occur. Two overlapping neurologic signs, at least one of which is present in approximately 20 percent of patients, are considered pathognomonic for Whipple disease. The first is oculomasticatory myorhythmia, characterized by continuous pendular convergence oscillations of the eyes combined with concurrent contractions of the masticatory muscles. This finding may be associated with myorhythmia of skeletal muscles, and is termed oculo-facial-skeletal myorhythmia. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating the organism on jejunal biopsy and treatment is with antibiotics.

It is the most common hereditary ataxia, affecting 1:50,000 Caucasians. The principal neurologic feature of FA is progressive gait and limb ataxia. Additional neurologic manifestations can include optic atrophy, swallowing dysfunction, upper motor neuron weakness, loss of position and vibration sense, and peripheral neuropathy. Cardiomyopathy and diabetes are found in many patients. Disease onset is usually before age 25 years, but some patients have a later disease onset. FA results from loss-of-function mutations in the FRDA gene. The vast majority of mutations (&gt;95 percent) are expansions of an intronic GAA trinucleotide repeat that results in transcription interference, with missense mutations accounting for most of the remaining mutant alleles. Disease severity and rate of progression are variable in FA, with more severe disease being associated with a higher number of GAA repeats. Most patients die between the ages of 30 and 40 years. The major causes of death are complications related to the cardiomyopathy and bulbar dysfunction.

This condition is caused by loss-of-function mutations in ATM, a gene important for surveillance of DNA damage. AT generally presents in early childhood. Children with AT who are homozygotes invariably suffer from progressive cerebellar ataxia, abnormal eye movements, other neurologic abnormalities, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, and immune deficiency. Associated features include pulmonary disease, an increased incidence of malignancy, radiation sensitivity, and diabetes mellitus caused by insulin resistance. AT is difficult to treat and has a poor prognosis because of its multisystem involvement. No specific treatment exists for the ataxic syndrome or the progressive cerebellar neurodegeneration. Many patients succumb to progressive pulmonary disease or to cancer, and the median age at death is approximately 25 years. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Nijmegen breakage syndrome</strong> (NBS) and <strong>ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder</strong> (ATLD), two related conditions, present with a somewhat later onset than ataxia-telangiectasia and with a slower progression and no telangiectasias.

Treatment at this time for these disorders is symptomatic only.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiple system atrophy</strong> (MSA) is the most common known cause of sporadic progressive cerebellar degeneration in adults, representing 29 percent of cases in one large published series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. MSA is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting the brainstem, cerebellum, and basal ganglia that usually begins in the fifth or sixth decade of life. The term &quot;multiple system atrophy&quot; (MSA) encompasses three clinical syndromes: MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C, previously known as olivopontocerebellar atrophy), Shy-Drager syndrome, and MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P, previously called striatonigral degeneration). The main clinical features of MSA are akinetic-rigid parkinsonism, autonomic failure, urogenital dysfunction, cerebellar ataxia, and pyramidal signs in varying combinations. The motor features of the MSA-C subtype involve predominant cerebellar dysfunction that manifests as gait ataxia, limb ataxia, ataxic dysarthria, and cerebellar disturbances of eye movements. Dysautonomia is a feature of both MSA-P and MSA-C. Pathologically, MSA is a synucleinopathy akin to Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, but the pathology and inclusions are seen in oligodendroglia and are often most predominant in the brainstem and cerebellum. The diagnosis (prior to autopsy) is based upon the clinical features and the exclusion of other causes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple system atrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-system-atrophy-prognosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple system atrophy: Prognosis and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Progressive supranuclear palsy</strong> is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by progressive supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, gait disorder and postural instability, dysarthria, dysphagia, rigidity, and frontal cognitive disturbance. Patients typically appear to have a surprised expression on their face and walk in a very upright fashion with extreme imbalance and a propensity to falls early in the course of the illness. PSP is now recognized to encompass a number of phenotypic variants. The two most common are Richardson syndrome (the classic form of PSP) and PSP-parkinsonism. Although ataxia is usually not a prominent symptom, it may be seen and is exacerbated by coexistent parkinsonism and oculomotor palsies. Pathologically, PSP is a tauopathy with the presence of tau positive neuronal inclusions in affected areas of the brain involving astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Early in the disease course, it can be difficult to differentiate it from Parkinson disease, MSA-P, or MSA-C. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP): Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2669252\"><span class=\"h2\">Other diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditions that may mimic cerebellar ataxia include sensory ataxia (eg, from large fiber sensory neuropathy), normal pressure hydrocephalus, obstructive hydrocephalus, migraine headache with ataxia, and psychogenic ataxia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Normal pressure hydrocephalus</strong> (NPH) refers to a condition of pathologically enlarged ventricular size with normal opening pressures on lumbar puncture. NPH is associated with a classic triad of cognitive impairment, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence. The gait most commonly associated with NPH is characterized by a wide base, hesitancy getting started (&quot;ignition failure&quot;) small steps and unsteadiness. As described, it can usually be differentiated clinically from the gait ataxia of cerebellar disease. Although not truly an example of ataxia, its potential reversibility by ventriculoperitoneal shunting is an important reason to include it in the differential diagnosis of cerebellar gait ataxia. Shunt responsive NPH is more likely when the gait disturbance appears early on and is more prominent than the cognitive impairment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-pressure-hydrocephalus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal pressure hydrocephalus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sensory ataxia</strong> due to large fiber sensory neuropathy or myelopathy can usually be distinguished by findings on neurologic examination. Neuropathy affecting large myelinated fiber tracts produces depressed reflexes and loss of proprioception and vibratory sense. Myelopathy affecting posterior columns, as occurs with tabes dorsalis and vitamin B12 deficiency, can present with similar findings. Both anatomic sites should be considered when planning a diagnostic workup, depending on individual circumstances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-sensory-loss#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with sensory loss&quot;, section on 'Neuropathy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Migraine headache with brainstem aura</strong> (previously called basilar-type migraine) is a rare syndrome that can be associated with episodic ataxia. Usually these patients have headache that occurs either with the ataxia or immediately afterwards; there is often a family history of migraines without ataxia. Of note, patients with genetic forms of episodic ataxia (EA-1 and EA-2) also often have headaches, which may or may not be temporally contiguous with their ataxic episodes, and this diagnosis should be considered in patients with headache and ataxia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Migraine with brainstem aura (basilar-type migraine)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17305952\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial step is to determine whether the ataxia is the result of a primary cerebellar abnormality. In particular, patients with peripheral neuropathy (eg, diabetic neuropathy) leading to proprioceptive loss or non-central vestibular dysfunction often present with complaints similar to cerebellar ataxia. Clinical examination with special focus on speech and oculomotor function can often distinguish these conditions. However, this process may be complicated, as some patients with cerebellar ataxia will have additional deficits involving proprioceptive sensation, vision, or motor strength that suggest either more widespread involvement of a single disease process or additional impairments from unrelated etiologies. &#160;</p><p>The next major decision point is based upon the acuity of onset and the progression of neurologic symptoms. Acute ataxia in an adult is an indication for emergent neuroimaging with a noncontrast head CT scan or MRI scan to evaluate for hemorrhage, <span class=\"nowrap\">ischemia/infarction,</span> or significant cerebellar edema. Patients should be monitored for signs of medullary and pontine compression, such as a decreased level of consciousness, worsening dysarthria, hiccups, yawning, progressive occipital headache, vertigo, or ocular motor paresis. Evidence for cerebellar swelling secondary to any process is an indication for medical therapy to lower the intracranial pressure and emergent neurosurgical evaluation for possible ventriculostomy or surgical decompression. Diagnostic screening for causative drugs and toxins is always an appropriate part of a comprehensive assessment. </p><p>The presence or absence of other neurologic or systemic problems can often help to delineate different etiologies of ataxia. Some systemic symptoms that can inform the differential diagnosis of ataxia include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal complaints are seen in Whipple disease, vitamin deficiencies, gluten enteropathy, hepatocerebral degeneration, and mitochondrial and metabolic disorders</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary symptoms or findings on a screening chest radiograph are seen in systemic infections, neurosarcoidosis, and lung cancer with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, among other disorders</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of cancer should prompt investigation of chemotherapy-induced ataxia, metastatic cancer, or paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rheumatologic diagnosis or a history consistent with autoimmune disease is suggestive of GAD-65 associated ataxia, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, lupus, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, and other autoimmune disorders</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermatologic findings are prominent in lupus, Lyme disease, and ataxia-telangiectasia, among others</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ataxia is associated with a retinopathy in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 and some mitochondrial disorders</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ataxia associated with ophthalmoplegia is seen in mitochondrial disorders, progressive supranuclear palsy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> deficiency, and Miller Fisher syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiomyopathy is seen in Friedreich ataxia and other mitochondrial disorders, as well as some vasculitic and autoimmune causes of ataxia</p><p/><p>In patients with acute or subacute onset of ataxia, a lumbar puncture (LP) is often needed to look for an infectious etiology. The presence of ataxia alone is an indication for neuroimaging prior to LP to evaluate for edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mass effect as causes of elevated intracranial pressure, which is a contraindication for LP because of the possibility of inducing cerebral or cerebellar herniation. When an LP is done to evaluate for infection, it is reasonable to collect extra cerebrospinal fluid so that it is available to test for oligoclonal bands and autoantibodies, including paraneoplastic antibodies, if the cerebrospinal fluid cell counts are not indicative of meningitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59302637\"><span class=\"h2\">Search for a treatable cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of other laboratory tests can be considered in patients presenting with cerebellar ataxia when the diagnosis is not immediately obvious on clinical and neuroimaging grounds. We obtain a short series of tests on the majority of patients presenting with ataxia to screen for easily treatable causes of this disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F90078\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90078 \">table 4</a>). Other laboratory tests are pursued on a case by case basis.</p><p>A particularly important treatable class of disorders are autoimmune ataxias. Although classified as paraneoplastic disorders, cerebellar ataxia associated with antibodies against cerebellar antigens (eg, GAD65, <span class=\"nowrap\">P/Q</span> calcium channel, and voltage gated potassium channels [VGKC], including Caspr2) may be negative for occult malignancy. These disorders can respond to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), plasma exchange, or oral immunosuppressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59302587\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A genetic evaluation for ataxia may be indicated if the initial workup is negative for obvious and reversible causes of ataxia and the condition is most consistent with a progressive degenerative condition of the cerebellum and brainstem. Determining the mode of inheritance and the age of symptom onset can help to narrow the list of likely genetic causes, which can be tested for systematically. However, many commercial genetic tests simultaneously screen for the most frequent known genetic ataxias. Despite that, commercially available tests screen only a fraction of the known inherited causes of ataxia. Thus, even if all genetic tests are negative, retesting for newly described causes of ataxia in the future may yield a diagnosis.</p><p>Our approach for patients with a slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia of unknown etiology is to obtain a genetic screen for the most common inherited causes of cerebellar ataxia, which are spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-spinocerebellar-ataxias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The spinocerebellar ataxias&quot;</a>) and Friedreich ataxia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=friedreich-ataxia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Friedreich ataxia&quot;</a>), regardless of family history. The yield of this limited genetic testing in patients with ataxia who have been screened for secondary causes is approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In patients with pigmentary retinopathy, we start our testing with SCA7. If this step is unrevealing, we screen older men for FMR1 gene premutations associated with fragile X-associated <span class=\"nowrap\">tremor/ataxia</span> syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-spinocerebellar-ataxias#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The spinocerebellar ataxias&quot;, section on 'Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome'</a>). In addition, we obtain alpha-fetoprotein and cholesterol levels to look for evidence of oculomotor apraxia types 1 and 2, ataxia-telangiectasia, and ataxia-telangiectasia variants (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ataxia-telangiectasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ataxia-telangiectasia&quot;</a>). We also check cholestenol levels for evidence of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis if there are any features of this disorder (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis&quot;</a>). We obtain genetic testing if laboratory or clinical evidence point to one of these conditions. </p><p>In remaining cases of cerebellar ataxia with a chronic progressive course and no confirmed etiology, whether familial or sporadic, we then proceed with clinical exome sequencing of all known associated ataxia genes where feasible. Several studies demonstrate that the yield of such evaluations are relatively high (upwards of 40 percent) in younger patients and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17305959\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the initial workup for cerebellar ataxia is aimed at finding a treatable cause. Unfortunately, numerous causes of cerebellar ataxia are currently without effective therapies. For many of these conditions, there are ongoing clinical trials and support groups or organizations for patients that can provide information and assist in the process of developing new therapeutics.</p><p>Supportive therapies, including physical and occupational therapy, are indicated for all patients with cerebellar ataxia and can be of substantial physical and psychological help. Limited data suggest that intensive coordination training improves motor dysfunction in ataxia and slows apparent clinical decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Many patients benefit from a home evaluation to improve the physical environment by installing handicap aids. Other symptomatic management options are largely dependent on comorbid aspects of the primary cerebellar process. As an example, patients with marked spasticity may benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a> or related agents.</p><p>In the case of the inherited ataxias, genetic counseling should be provided both before and after any genetic testing is conducted, to insure optimal communication and to help patients understand important ethical and practical aspects, such as insurability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119257179\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar syndromes can be divided into symptoms arising from damage to the midline structures or hemispheric structures, although there is significant clinical overlap between these syndromes. The midline cerebellar structures are critical for motor execution, rapid and slow eye movements, <span class=\"nowrap\">balance/lower</span> extremity coordination, and vestibular function. Damage to the midline of the cerebellum tends to produce gait ataxia and imbalance, truncal ataxia, dysmetria, ocular findings, head bobbing, and vertigo. The cerebellar hemispheres are largely concerned with motor planning and coordination of complex tasks. Damage to one hemisphere leads to symptoms that are most notable in the ipsilateral limbs. The clinical signs most commonly seen include dysdiadochokinesis, dysmetria, limb ataxia, intention tremor, and scanning speech. (See <a href=\"#H17305672\" class=\"local\">'Clinical and anatomic correlations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are many different etiologies for cerebellar disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F90074\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90074 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F90077\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90077 \">table 2</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H17305707\" class=\"local\">'Acute ataxias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of subacute ataxias is typically on the order of days to weeks, with progression occurring over weeks to months rather than years. There is significant variability in the time course of these disorders, such that they can sometimes present in an acute or chronic fashion. Etiologies include atypical infections, chronic exposure to toxins or medications, alcohol abuse and vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, systemic metabolic disorders, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, and neoplasms. (See <a href=\"#H17305742\" class=\"local\">'Subacute ataxias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic progressive ataxia is the most common presentation of the hereditary forms of cerebellar ataxia and the neurodegenerative causes of cerebellar dysfunction. Hereditary conditions account for the majority of ataxic syndromes in children and one-third to one-half of patients with adult-onset ataxic syndromes.
