Uterine sarcomas arise from dividing cell populations in the myometrium or connective tissue elements within the endometrium. Compared with the more common endometrial carcinomas (epithelial neoplasms), uterine sarcomas, particularly leiomyosarcomas (connective tissue neoplasms), behave aggressively and are associated with a poorer prognosis.

Staging and treatment of endometrial stromal tumors and leiomyosarcoma are discussed separately. Carcinosarcoma, which is no longer classified as a sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma, which typically arises in children and adolescents, are also discussed separately.

The histologic classification of these neoplasms is based upon the <span class=\"nowrap\">differentiation/growth</span> pattern of the neoplastic cells and their presumed cell of origin. </p><p>Uterine sarcomas are referred to as homologous or heterologous. The majority are homologous (ie, differentiate in ways similar to normal uterine tissues), including endometrium (endometrial stromal sarcomas), muscle (leiomyosarcoma), or sarcomas of nonspecific supporting tissue (eg, connective tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics). By contrast, heterologous tumors contain elements with non-native differentiation (eg, skeletal muscle, cartilage, bone).</p><p>Historically, uterine carcinosarcoma was classified as a type of uterine sarcoma and was termed malignant mixed m&uuml;llerian tumor or mixed mesodermal sarcoma. However, these neoplasms are now classified as carcinomas since they derive from a monoclonal neoplastic cell, which has more characteristics of epithelial than stromal neoplasms. In addition, the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical behavior associated with carcinosarcoma suggest a closer relationship to endometrial carcinoma than to sarcoma.

Historically, they were characterized as either low-grade or high-grade ESS. However, high-grade endometrial stromal tumors are now referred to as undifferentiated endometrial sarcomas (UES) or high-grade undifferentiated uterine sarcomas (HGUS), reflecting their composition of anaplastic cells with little or no evidence of endometrial stromal differentiation. The term endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) is primarily limited to neoplasms previously referred to as &quot;low grade.&quot; Some observers believe there is a distinct entity of high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (distinct from undifferentiated uterine sarcoma); however, this is controversial.

Epithelial neoplasms have a clearly defined behavior (invasion) that indicates metastatic potential. Because smooth muscle neoplasms arise in the stroma (do not live in a compartment), they are more difficult to distinguish as benign (without metastatic potential) or malignant (with metastatic potential). Cellular atypia, mitosis, and &quot;coagulative necrosis&quot; are known as the Stanford criteria (originally described by the Stanford group). In the largest retrospective study, which resulted in the development of these criteria, the presence of two of the three features indicated a risk of metastatic spread of &gt;10 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78735 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-sarcoma-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, opinions vary as to the exact level of mitotic activity required for diagnosis of sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-sarcoma-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other common features, which are not diagnostic in isolation but may be used in borderline cases, are hypercellularity and infiltrative border [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-sarcoma-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Leiomyosarcomas typically are large (&gt;10 cm) yellow or tan solitary masses with soft, fleshy cut surfaces with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-sarcoma-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The mass may bulge into the uterine cavity, but the epicenter is in the myometrium.</p><p>Leiomyosarcomas and leiomyomas are independent entities. Leiomyosarcomas are rare and while they may coexist in the same uterus with benign leiomyomas (fibroids), they exhibit differing cytogenetic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-sarcoma-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>], and leiomyomas do not appear to be the precursor to leiomyosarcomas. Both neoplasms may express estrogen and progesterone receptors. Series of 20 or more leiomyosarcomas have reported estrogen receptors in 48 to 57 percent and progesterone receptors in 30 to 43 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-sarcoma-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Epithelioid leiomyomas with atypia and &ge;5 mitoses per 10 high power fields qualify as leiomyosarcoma. The absence of coagulative necrosis does not confirm benign behavior in these neoplasms. The clinical behavior is not well established for large (&gt;6 cm) epithelioid smooth muscle neoplasms with moderate mitotic activity (two to four mitoses per 10 high power fields).

Compared with the more common endometrial carcinomas (epithelial neoplasms), uterine sarcomas behave more aggressively and are associated with a poorer prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine sarcomas are rare. The incidence is 0.36 per 100,000 woman-years in the United States. The mean age at diagnosis is approximately 60 years old. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for uterine sarcoma include: black race (for leiomyosarcoma, but not endometrial stromal sarcoma), long-term use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> (five years or more), and pelvic radiation. Genetic conditions associated with uterine sarcoma are hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome and hereditary childhood retinoblastoma. (See <a href=\"#H478316\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine sarcomas are classified as stromal or mixed epithelial-stromal neoplasms. The three most common types are stromal: endometrial stromal sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and undifferentiated uterine sarcoma. Adenosarcomas are considered sarcomas. Uterine carcinosarcoma is now classified as a carcinoma rather than sarcomas, though they have stromal differentiation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-treatment-of-uterine-carcinosarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of uterine carcinosarcoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine sarcomas typically present with vaginal bleeding, pelvic pressure symptoms (eg, pressure, urinary frequency, constipation), or abdominal distension. On pelvic examination, the uterus is often enlarged. (See <a href=\"#H2709019\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although it is common clinical teaching to suspect a sarcoma in women with a &quot;rapidly growing&quot; uterus or leiomyoma (ie, doubling in size over a period of three to six months), the data do not support an increased risk of malignant neoplasm in such patients. (See <a href=\"#H2709019\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of uterine sarcoma is based upon histologic examination. Data regarding diagnostic accuracy of serum markers, biopsy, or imaging are limited in this rare disease. Endometrial biopsy may yield an accurate diagnosis in some patients, but a negative biopsy does not rule out the disease.
