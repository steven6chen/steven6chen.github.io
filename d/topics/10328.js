Scars secondary to acne can lead to physical disfigurement and the psychosocial impact can be profound. Early and effective treatment of acne is the best means to minimize and prevent acne scarring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although a variety of therapies may reduce the prominence of acne scars, no therapy removes acne scars completely. A multimodality approach to scar treatment is usually necessary to achieve the best cosmetic results. The selection of an approach to treatment is based upon factors such as the type and degree of acne scarring, patient preference, side effects, cost, and treatment availability. </p><p>The management of scarring secondary to acne vulgaris will be reviewed here. The therapeutic approach to active acne is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1053421865\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acne scarring represents an altered wound healing response to cutaneous inflammation that leads to an imbalance in matrix degradation and collagen biosynthesis. Although scarring is a common consequence of inflammatory acne vulgaris, not all patients develop scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The reasons for discrepancies in the propensity to scar are not clear.</p><p>One theory focuses on a role for the nature of the inflammatory response in determining which patients develop scarring. This concept is supported by an immunohistochemical study of 8 patients not prone to acne scarring and 11 patients prone to acne scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Specimens from early lesions from patients who were not prone to acne scarring demonstrated a large, active, nonspecific immune response that subsided with lesion resolution. In contrast, patients prone to acne scarring had a smaller, more specific immune response in early lesions that was increased and activated in resolving lesions. This persistent inflammation in healing tissue may contribute to scarring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1751860176\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acne scars can be divided based upon morphology into atrophic scars and hypertrophic scars. An individual patient may have more than one type of scar.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atrophic scars </strong>&ndash; Atrophic scars, the most common type of acne scars, are caused by destruction and loss of collagen in the dermis and present as indentations in the skin. Destructive inflammation in the deep dermis and subsequent contraction is thought to result in the indented appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Atrophic scars may be subclassified into ice pick, rolling, and boxcar scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Ice pick scars </strong>&ndash; Ice pick scars are usually narrow (&lt;2 mm), deep, sharply demarcated tracts that can extend into the deep dermis or subcutaneous tissue. Ice pick scars are typically wider at the epithelial surface and taper as they go deeper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Rolling scars </strong>&ndash; Rolling scars are usually wider (4 to 5 mm) and more shallow than ice pick scars and produce an undulating appearance in otherwise normal-appearing skin. The rise and fall of the skin surface is due to abnormal fibrous attachment of the dermis to the subcutis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Boxcar scars </strong>&ndash; Boxcar scars are wider at the base than ice pick scars and do not taper. These round- to oval-shaped skin dimples have sharp margins and can be either shallow (&lt;0.5 mm) or deep (&gt;0.5 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypertrophic scars and keloids </strong>&ndash; Hypertrophic acne scars and keloids are less common than atrophic acne scars and are characterized by collagen gain subsequent to the resolution of an acne lesion, resulting in a firm, raised papule or plaque. Hypertrophic scars do not extend beyond the margin of the original wound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In contrast, keloids extend beyond the margin of the original wound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Keloids and hypertrophic scars&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The clinical appearance of both atrophic and hypertrophic acne scars may be accentuated by erythema. The treatment of erythema in acne scars is an important (and often initial) component of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H106345593\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of erythema'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients often use the term acne scars to refer to the persistent postinflammatory hyperpigmentation that is a common side effect of acne, particularly in individuals with dark skin (skin phototype IV to VI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>)). Unlike the permanent textural changes that result from true scarring, pigmentary changes tend to slowly improve over time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acne-vulgaris#H36\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Therapy for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106345512\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pretreatment clinical assessment is an essential component of acne scar treatment. The pretreatment assessment serves to determine whether the patient is a good candidate for treatment and allows the clinician to obtain a clear understanding of the patient's expectations and tolerance for certain procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106345491\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient interview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We begin our evaluation by eliciting the specific concerns and expectations of the patient and the patient's medical history. This discussion helps the clinician to identify treatments that will best address the patient's concerns and helps the clinician to begin to assess risk for side effects of treatment. We review the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient's specific concerns about scar appearance and desired outcome of treatment</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Status of acne</strong> (resolution of acne is preferred prior to acne scar treatment) (see <a href=\"#H1751860246\" class=\"local\">'Precautions'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History of acne treatment including </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a><strong> use</strong> (recent isotretinoin use may impact wound healing) (see <a href=\"#H1751860246\" class=\"local\">'Precautions'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History of poor wound healing, keloid formation, or postinflammatory hyperpigmentation</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History of other skin disorders</strong> (particularly disorders that may appear or worsen at sites of skin injury, such as lichen planus or psoriasis) <strong>and medical disorders or medications</strong> that may affect risk for infection or poor healing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prior cosmetic procedures in the site of treatment</strong></p><p/><p>In addition to the points above, a discussion with the patient to obtain a clear understanding for the patient's ability and willingness to tolerate side effects is of critical importance for developing an appropriate plan for treatment. While some patients may be willing to tolerate the discomfort, risks, and long recovery period associated with an aggressive and often very effective procedure, such as traditional ablative laser resurfacing, other patients may be willing to accept lesser benefit in exchange for less aggressive treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H699560548\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination allows the clinician to assess the characteristics of acne scars to determine the treatment approaches that are likely to be beneficial. Direct overhead lighting will accentuate the scars, facilitating the visualization of scars and scar features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Key features to identify on the physical examination of acne scars include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type of scars</strong> (ice pick, rolling, boxcar, hypertrophic, or keloidal; scar type influences the response to specific treatments) (see <a href=\"#H1751860176\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1751860356\" class=\"local\">'Focal treatment of scars'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1673936\" class=\"local\">'Individual atrophic acne scars'</a> below) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Color of scars</strong> (the appearance of erythematous acne scars can be improved with vascular laser treatment) (see <a href=\"#H106345593\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of erythema'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Depth of scars</strong> (superficial procedures may have little effect on deep scars)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Location of scars</strong> (nonfacial scars are more resistant to therapy than facial scars, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and nonfacial skin has a lesser capacity for regeneration after resurfacing procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>])</p><p/><p>The physical examination should also include an assessment for features that may increase the risk for poor outcomes from certain treatments. Key features to recognize include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scar distensibility </strong>&ndash;<strong> do scars disappear when surrounding skin is gently stretched?</strong> (Scars that are not distensible, including ice pick scars and tethered scars, will not respond well to injectable soft tissue fillers)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Palpable fibrosis beneath scars</strong> (if present, scar excision or a procedure to remove or release the tethering fibrosis [eg, excision or subcision] is necessary prior to other treatments)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Keloidal or hypertrophic scars in other body areas </strong>(suggests increased risk for scarring)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin color</strong> (patients with dark skin color [skin phototypes IV to VI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>)] have elevated risk for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation as a consequence of certain treatments [eg, some resurfacing procedures and chemical peels] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]) (see <a href=\"#H1751860246\" class=\"local\">'Precautions'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1751860239\"><span class=\"h2\">Review of treatment expectations and risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An in-depth discussion with the patient about expected treatment outcomes and side effects is essential prior to proceeding with treatment. A clinician who does not have a clear understanding of the patient's desired outcome and tolerance for side effects may select a treatment regimen that is overly or insufficiently aggressive. In addition, poor communication between the clinician and patient about the expected degree of improvement from a procedure may result in a dissatisfied patient despite an outcome that the clinician perceives as excellent for a particular procedure.</p><p>In general, patients receiving treatment of acne scars should be informed that: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acne scars are rarely completely or almost completely removed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several procedures may be required to obtain optimal correction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A recovery period may be required depending on the treatment(s) selected (eg, traditional ablative resurfacing may require a recovery period of up to two weeks)</p><p/><p>The side effects of each procedure being considered should be discussed in detail with the patient. Infection, hyperpigmentation, prolonged erythema, swelling, poor wound healing, and scarring are risks associated with many acne scar procedures. Because acne scar therapy is an elective procedure, knowledge of expected side effects and risks strongly influences the willingness of patients to undergo specific procedures. Patients who are educated about the characteristics, risk, and expected outcomes are empowered to make informed decisions regarding treatment. Financial considerations also may limit the ability of patients to proceed with certain treatments. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1751860246\"><span class=\"h2\">Precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain patient characteristics increase risk for adverse effects from acne scar treatment. Examples of very common characteristics that impact treatment risk include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Active acne </strong>&ndash; Patients with active acne should first have the disease under control with topical or oral treatment, as indicated, before beginning treatment for acne scarring. There is no point in treating acne scars if acne is not under control because new scars will continue to form after scar treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recent </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a><strong> therapy </strong>&ndash; Patients seeking laser resurfacing for acne scars often have a history of severe acne and may have received isotretinoin therapy. There has been concern regarding increased risk for impaired wound healing and excessive scarring following cutaneous procedures performed within 6 to 12 months after isotretinoin therapy. However, a systematic review found insufficient evidence to support delaying manual dermabrasion, superficial chemical peels, cutaneous surgery, and ablative or nonablative fractional laser procedures secondary to recent isotretinoin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Delaying traditional ablative laser resurfacing procedures is still recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin phototype IV to type VI </strong>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>)<strong> </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Patients with dark skin tones are at increased risk for procedure-related postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Diffuse, widespread hyperpigmentation lasting one year or more can follow ablative laser resurfacing and is a common side effect of medium and deep chemical peels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Procedures with less risk for hyperpigmentation, such as fractional laser resurfacing, skin needling, injectable soft tissue fillers, and subcision are preferable for patients who desire less risk for this side effect.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1751860276\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, high-quality trials of interventions for acne scars are lacking. A systematic review of randomized trials found insufficient evidence to recommend any particular intervention as first-line treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. More high-quality placebo-controlled trials are needed to clarify the efficacy of treatments. The approach to treatment reviewed here is based upon a review of the available evidence and consideration of the practical aspects of treatment.</p><p>The ideal treatment regimen for acne scars is efficacious for the types of acne scars present and reflects the level of patient tolerance for transient side effects. In the clinical setting, clinicians must work with patients to identify a treatment regimen that is consistent with the relative importance of these factors for the patient. A patient who is very uncomfortable with treatment risk may prefer a regimen that may be less effective because it is low risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1751860334\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized atrophic facial acne scars</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frequently, patients who present for the treatment of facial acne scars have multiple scars, a presentation that is best managed with a field approach to treatment. Patients who require treatment of only a few specific scars can be managed with some of the same treatments. (See <a href=\"#H1673936\" class=\"local\">'Individual atrophic acne scars'</a> below.)</p><p>Because no single treatment completely removes acne scars, a multimodality approach to generalized facial acne scars is most likely to provide the best results from treatment. Our ideal result-focused approach to generalized atrophic facial acne scars can be summarized in three key steps: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 1:</strong> An <strong>initial treatment phase</strong> that consists of the treatment of erythema within scars (if present) and focal treatments to target individual scars that are likely to be resistant to collagen remodeling procedures </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 2:</strong> A <strong>collagen remodeling procedure </strong>(the gold standard is full-face resurfacing with a traditional ablative laser) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Additional treatments</strong> designed to address resistant scars and augment the results of the collagen remodeling procedure (eg, injectable soft tissue fillers, additional nonablative or ablative fractional laser treatments)</p><p/><p>However, this result-focused regimen usually is not feasible because it requires high patient tolerance for invasive and time-consuming procedures and long recovery periods. Therefore, we usually sculpt a regimen from this framework that maximizes results within the boundaries of the patient's tolerance for side effects. The therapeutic options for each step are reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1751860341\"><span class=\"h3\">Step 1: Treatment of erythema and challenging scars</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of the initial treatment phase is the treatment of scar erythema and individual scars that are likely to be resistant to collagen remodeling procedures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106345593\"><span class=\"h4\">Treatment of erythema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of scar erythema is an important component of acne scar treatment because erythema accentuates acne scars and makes scars more noticeable to the observer. Treatment of erythema can improve the appearance of acne scars even without improvement in the more difficult to correct textural abnormalities. Pulsed-dye laser (PDL) therapy is the treatment of choice for scar erythema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29173654\"><span class=\"h5\">Pulsed-dye laser</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulsed-dye laser therapy improves erythema in scars by targeting oxyhemoglobin within vascular structures in the skin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions#H12728454\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions&quot;, section on 'Principles'</a>.)</p><p>Efficacy of this treatment for acne scars is supported by a split-face, observer-blinded study in which 22 patients with erythematous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertrophic facial acne scars had one cheek treated with one or two treatment sessions with a 585 nm flashlamp-pumped dye laser (0.45 ms pulse, average fluence 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup>,</span> 7 mm spot size) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Six weeks after an initial treatment, the mean reduction in clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">erythema/scarring</span> compared with the appearance of surrounding normal skin was 68 percent for treated areas. In contrast, significant clinical improvement was not observed in the scars on the untreated areas. </p><p>Successful treatment of acne scar erythema with a pulsed-dye laser usually requires three to four or more treatments given at approximately one-month intervals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106345605\"><span class=\"h5\">Other therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our experience, other light-based devices used to treat vascular lesions such as the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser and intense pulsed-light devices can be effective for scar erythema. In addition, marked clinical improvement in postinflammatory erythema in acne scars has been reported after nonablative fractional laser treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1751860356\"><span class=\"h4\">Focal treatment of scars</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deep ice pick scars and deep boxcar scars may respond poorly to laser resurfacing and other collagen remodeling procedures.

An uncontrolled study of 18 patients with atrophic (primarily rolling) acne scars suggests that subcision performed with a blunt blade also may be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">When subcision is successful, new collagen forms beneath the scar without recreating a depression. Multiple treatments may be necessary to achieve significant improvement in an acne scar. Complications include swelling, bruising, bleeding, and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Punch excision and punch elevation</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Indication:</strong> Ice pick and boxcar scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Description:</strong> Punch excision is an effective treatment for ice pick scars and small (&lt;3 mm) boxcar scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A punch biopsy instrument of equal to or slightly greater diameter than the scar is used to incise the tissue to the subcutaneous fat layer and excise the scar. The wound site is sutured. Scar spreading and suture track marks are problems that can follow punch excisions. For scars larger than 3.5 mm, elliptical excision may be more favorable than punch excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">A punch grafting procedure in which tissue from another site is placed in the site of the excised acne scar has also been used, but there may be a mismatch of tissue color and texture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Results from punch excision are often better.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Punch elevation is best performed on scars with sharp edges and normal appearing bases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Therefore, the procedure is best suited for boxcar scars. A punch biopsy tool that is exactly the size of the inner surface of the scar is used to incise the scar to the depth of the subcutaneous tissue. Rather than removing the tissue as is done in punch excision, the tissue is elevated and sutured at a position that is slightly higher than the surrounding skin. Contraction during wound healing leads to uniform elevation of the scar surface and surrounding skin. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Clinical experience suggests that placing a single buried suture using 6-0 Vicryl suture for punch holes that are &gt;2.5 mm in diameter may help with wound healing and minimize spreading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. To minimize suture track marks, it is important that the epidermal sutures are not tightened excessively and are removed from facial sites no more than seven days after the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1673615\"><span class=\"h3\">Step 2: Collagen remodeling procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrophic acne scars result from a loss of collagen in the dermis. Our second phase of treatment for generalized facial atrophic acne scars consists of a procedure to induce collagen remodeling. Examples of procedures that can achieve this endpoint include traditional ablative laser resurfacing, nonablative fractional laser resurfacing, ablative fractional laser resurfacing, chemical peels, dermabrasion, and skin needling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H699562194\"><span class=\"h4\">First-line treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional ablative laser resurfacing is the most effective method to achieve this endpoint, but is an aggressive procedure that is not tolerated by all patients. Patients typically do not need more than one treatment, but the treatment has a significant recovery period. Nonablative fractional laser resurfacing, a less aggressive and less risky procedure, is our preferred alternative to traditional ablative laser resurfacing. Disadvantages of nonablative fractional laser therapy include lesser efficacy and the requirement for multiple treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1751860408\"><span class=\"h5\">Traditional ablative laser resurfacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional ablative laser resurfacing involves the use of a 2940 nm erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) laser or 10,600 nm carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) laser. These lasers target water in the skin, resulting in the ablation of the epidermis and dermis in very precise increments. The thermal injury caused by the laser promotes collagen contraction, collagen remodeling, and skin tightening, effects that can result in improvement in the appearance of scars (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96513%7EDERM%2F96512%7EDERM%2F96514\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96513 graphicRef96512 graphicRef96514 \">picture 1A-C</a>).

All patients achieved significant immediate and prolonged improvement in skin tone, texture, and appearance of treated scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. One month after treatment, clinical improvement scores were improved by a mean of 69 percent. After 18 months, the mean improvement was 75 percent. Continued collagenesis and dermal remodeling were evident in histologic specimens up to 18 months after surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Multiple uncontrolled studies support the efficacy of ablative Er:YAG lasers for the treatment of atrophic acne scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-27</a>]. As an example, a nonrandomized prospective study that compared the efficacy of short-pulsed, variable-pulsed, and dual-mode Er:YAG lasers in 158 patients with facial acne scars found that treatment with all three lasers was associated with good to excellent improvement in ice pick and shallow boxcar scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Deep boxcar scars did not respond well to short-pulsed Er:YAG laser treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash; Traditional ablative laser resurfacing is an intense procedure with a relatively long post-treatment recovery period (up to two weeks after CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing). Therefore, candidates for this treatment must be carefully selected. The treatment plan includes important preoperative (eg, antiviral prophylaxis), intraoperative, and postoperative measures to promote the best outcome of treatment. General preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative measures for ablative laser resurfacing are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation#H1449883\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ablative laser resurfacing for skin rejuvenation&quot;, section on 'Administration'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Expert training is required to perform ablative laser resurfacing. The target endpoint that determines the number of laser passes during each treatment session, initial visualization of the sebaceous glands in the dermis, can be difficult to appreciate. In addition, this portion of the procedure can become disorienting secondary to bleeding. To mediate this, we laser the most dependent region first during each laser pass and proceed superiorly. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Each laser pass leaves a layer of eschar. We leave the eschar in place after the last laser pass, rather than wiping it away. This allows the eschar to act as a biologic dressing until it gently sloughs over the subsequent three to five days. Clinicians vary on preferred post-treatment wound care. Our post-treatment care consists of daily to twice daily soaks with acetic acid (1:10 dilution with water) followed by application of petrolatum; saline or water soaks are also commonly used. We do not use an overlying dressing. Patients can usually return to work approximately two weeks after CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing; the convalescent period for Er:YAG laser resurfacing is usually three to eight days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Potential adverse effects of ablative laser resurfacing include persistent erythema, hypopigmentation (an expected effect), hyperpigmentation, infection, and scarring. Erythema is common and usually resolves within several weeks, but occasionally persists for longer. In young patients, dyspigmentation often improves over the course of 3 to 12 months. The risk for dyspigmentation is greatest in patients with skin phototypes III to VI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Because of the potential for dyspigmentation in this population, a conservative number of laser passes is prudent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Improvement from full-face ablative laser resurfacing and the potential loss of pigmentation continue for months postoperatively. Therefore, a waiting period of 6 to 12 months is necessary prior to retreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1751860422\"><span class=\"h5\">Nonablative fractional laser resurfacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonablative fractional resurfacing (NAFR) is a frequently used alternative to traditional ablative laser resurfacing because of the lesser recovery time required after this procedure (typically one to three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]). Most commonly, the 1550 nm or 1540 nm NAFR lasers are used. Rather than ablating a continuous area of skin, fractional lasers emit narrow microscopic columns of laser light, which allows for the treatment of a fraction of the area of skin in the treatment area while leaving intervening areas of unaffected skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53757\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53757 \">figure 1</a>). This translates into reduced side effects and shorter recovery times compared with traditional ablative lasers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonablative-skin-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation#H3581065\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonablative skin resurfacing for skin rejuvenation&quot;, section on 'Fractional lasers'</a>.)</p><p>However, multiple treatments with a nonablative fractional laser are typically required to achieve satisfactory effects on scarring. Compared with traditional ablative lasers, the efficacy of nonablative lasers on dermal collagen remodelling is more limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>&ndash; Benefit from NAFR has been reported in randomized trials; however, most of these trials have compared NAFR to other modalities rather than to placebo or no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/14,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,32</a>]. The first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of nonablative fractional laser resurfacing on atrophic acne scars was a split-face trial that compared the efficacy of three treatment sessions with a 1540 nm erbium-glass fractional laser at four-week intervals on one side of the face in 10 patients with no treatment on the contralateral side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The response to treatment was assessed by a single blinded evaluator after 4 and 12 weeks. Statistically significant reductions in acne scar severity scores were seen on the laser-treated side but not on the untreated side. Of the 10 patients, 5 reported that the appearance of acne scars was moderately or significantly improved after treatment, 3 noted slight improvement, and 2 reported no improvement after treatment. Uncontrolled studies also suggest a beneficial effect of nonablative fractional laser treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In comparison to ablative fractional laser resurfacing, available data suggest that patients treated with nonablative fractional laser resurfacing will experience a shorter duration of post-treatment erythema, a lower likelihood of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, and less pain during the procedure, with minimal loss in the efficacy of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. More trials that directly compare nonablative and ablative fractional laser therapy for acne scars are necessary to confirm this conclusion. We find that most of our patients prefer nonablative fractional laser treatment because of the expected shorter recovery time after treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1673521\" class=\"local\">'Ablative fractional laser resurfacing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash; Our typical nonablative fractional laser resurfacing treatment regimen consists of four to six treatments given at one-month intervals. Treatment is usually well tolerated, but is not immune to adverse effects. In a retrospective study of 961 patients (skin phototype I to V (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>)) treated with a 1550 nm erbium-doped fractional laser, acneiform eruptions and herpes simplex virus eruption were among the most common adverse effects, each occurring in approximately 2 percent of patients. Less common side effects included erosions, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, prolonged erythema (&gt;4 days), prolonged edema (&gt;2 days), dermatitis, impetigo, and purpura. As with other resurfacing procedures, patients with darkly pigmented skin have increased risk for post-treatment hyperpigmentation. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H699562831\"><span class=\"h4\">Other collagen remodeling procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional ablative laser resurfacing and nonablative fractional laser therapies are our preferred collagen remodeling procedures because they are precise and controlled methods of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, factors such as treatment availability, clinician expertise, patient-specific risk factors, patient preference, and cost may support other therapeutic approaches. Additional treatment options include ablative fractional laser therapy, chemical peels, dermabrasion, and skin needling. An advantage of skin needling is the minimal risk for the postinflammatory hyperpigmentation that is a potential side effect of other collagen remodeling treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1673521\"><span class=\"h5\">Ablative fractional laser resurfacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although ablative fractional lasers (Er:YAG, yttrium-scandium-gallium-garnet [Er:YSSG], and CO<sub>2</sub> lasers) can improve acne scars, we favor nonablative fractional laser resurfacing when it is available because available evidence suggests that ablative fractional laser treatment is associated with greater side effects and little extra benefit in the response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>&ndash; Multiple prospective and retrospective studies support the efficacy of ablative fractional lasers on acne scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/36-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-41</a>]. This includes a single-blind intra-individual trial in which 13 patients with atrophic acne scars received three ablative fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatments at one-month intervals on one 9 to 30 cm<sup>2</sup> scarred area on the face and no treatment on a scarred facial area of similar size and appearance.

High fluence settings also may yield better results, but the use of high fluence settings is tempered by the potential for increased side effects. A typical ablative fractional laser treatment course consists of 6 to 10 treatments given at one to two month intervals using relatively high densities, low energy, and multiple passes. Caution is necessary, as excessive density settings may increase risk for hypertrophic scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Treatment causes some pain, and a topical anesthetic is usually applied prior to treatment. Common side effects after ablative fractional laser treatment include erythema, edema, crusting, and scaling, all of which usually resolve within two weeks. Dyspigmentation, scarring, herpes simplex virus reactivation, petechiae, bleeding, and itching are additional potential side effects. Patients with darkly pigmented skin have the highest risk for post-treatment postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. In a randomized trial that compared two treatment regimens with a 1550 nm Er:YAG fractional laser for the treatment of facial acne scars in patients with skin phototypes IV, V, and VI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>), moderate postinflammatory hyperpigmentation occurred in 6 of the 15 treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Similar to fractional lasers, needling procedures induce small columns of damage in the epidermis and dermis, leaving intervening skin untouched. A needling device typically consists of a cylinder that is circumferentially studded with 1 to 2.5 mm long needles.

The duration of effect, clinician familiarity and experience with products, and location of scar influence choice of filler. Temporary soft tissue fillers, fillers that slowly degrade within tissue over time, are most commonly used for acne scars. With temporary fillers retreatment is usually necessary. Liquid injectable silicone, an example of a permanent filler, is a cost-effective treatment that yields long-term results, but should only be used by experienced and expert clinicians (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96515%7EDERM%2F96516\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96515 graphicRef96516 \">picture 3A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Improper use of liquid injectable silicone has resulted in serious adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. Strict adherence to safety measures is critical. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=injectable-soft-tissue-fillers-temporary-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Injectable soft tissue fillers: Temporary agents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=injectable-soft-tissue-fillers-permanent-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Injectable soft tissue fillers: Permanent agents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Injection of autologous fibroblasts may be a future alternative to manufactured soft tissue fillers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1673936\"><span class=\"h2\">Individual atrophic acne scars</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with isolated acne scars or who are only concerned about specific scars may not require extensive collagen remodeling procedures to achieve the desired level of improvement. Procedures such as subcision, punch excision, punch elevation, chemical reconstruction of acne scars (CROSS technique), injection of soft tissue fillers, and focal dermabrasion can effectively treat individual lesions. (See <a href=\"#H1751860356\" class=\"local\">'Focal treatment of scars'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1751860436\" class=\"local\">'Injectable soft tissue fillers'</a> above.)</p><p>Focal treatments that are most appropriate based upon scar type are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ice pick scars </strong>&ndash; punch excision or CROSS technique</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Boxcar scars </strong>&ndash; CROSS for small scars, punch or elliptical excision, punch elevation, or focal dermabrasion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rolling scars </strong>&ndash; subcision or injectable soft tissue fillers</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H699565845\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonfacial atrophic acne scars</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrophic acne scars are most commonly found on the face, but may also occur in other areas prone to acne vulgaris, such as the shoulders, back, and chest. Studies to determine the best approach to the treatment of nonfacial atrophic acne scars are lacking.</p><p>Nonfacial atrophic acne scars and facial atrophic acne scars are similar in appearance; however, the treatment of nonfacial scars warrants additional considerations. Although many of the same therapies can be attempted, nonfacial scars are more resistant to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and the results of collagen remodeling procedures are often unsatisfying. </p><p>Moreover, the lower density of skin appendages in nonfacial skin compared with facial skin results in lesser capacity for skin regeneration after skin resurfacing procedures, a feature that may increase risk for postprocedure scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/10,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,43</a>]. Because of this risk, treatment with traditional ablative lasers is usually avoided and conservative laser settings (eg, lower density and lower energy levels) are used for treatments with ablative fractional lasers. Care must also be taken to avoid excessive use of topical anesthesia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9772069\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertrophic acne scars and keloids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertrophic scars and keloids are less common than atrophic acne scars and are characterized by firm, raised lesions. The management of hypertrophic scars and keloids secondary to acne is similar to the management of hypertrophic and keloidal scars from other etiologies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Keloids and hypertrophic scars&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H699565287\"><span class=\"h3\">First-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intralesional corticosteroid injections are the first-line therapy for keloids and hypertrophic scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The proposed mechanisms of action include decreased fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis along with a reduction in inflammatory mediators. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Triamcinolone</a> acetonide (10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> is injected directly into the scar to reduce its size and thickness. Higher concentrations (up to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> are used for very thick scars. </p><p>We typically repeat treatments every four to six weeks, and discontinue treatment if at least a partial response is not evident within four treatments. Dose-dependent adverse effects of intralesional corticosteroid therapy include hypopigmentation, dermal atrophy, and telangiectasias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intralesional-injection#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intralesional injection&quot;, section on 'Side effects, complications, and pitfalls'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9772083\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional common therapies for hypertrophic scars and keloidal scars are pulsed-dye laser therapy and silicone gel sheeting. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulsed-dye laser </strong>&ndash; Pulsed-dye laser therapy can improve hypertrophic scars and keloids. The technique requires a series of adjacent nonoverlapping laser pulses delivered across the entire scar breadth. The scar's size, thickness, location, and color, as well as the patient's skin type, determine the fluence that should be used. After an initial treatment, the fluence is maintained, increased, or decreased based upon response and side effects. Thick or dark scars usually require higher fluences than thin and light scars.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most common adverse effect of pulsed-dye laser treatment is postoperative purpura, which often persists for several days. Pulse durations shorter than 6 ms are almost certain to cause bruising. Edema of treated skin may also occur but usually subsides within 48 hours. Treated areas should be gently cleansed daily with water and mild soap. Strict sun avoidance and photoprotection should be advocated between treatment sessions in order to reduce the risk of pigment alteration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Silicone gel sheeting </strong>&ndash; Application of silicone gel sheeting to hypertrophic scars and keloids can result in clinical improvement. The mechanism through which benefit occurs is not fully understood. One theory is that a combination of pressure and hydration from the occlusive dressing may be responsible rather than the silicone itself. Hydration inhibits fibroblast production of collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Other proposed mechanisms include prevention of bacteria-induced collagen production and modulation of expression of the profibrotic cytokines fibroblast growth factor-beta<strong> </strong>and transforming growth factor-beta<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Additionally, silicone gel sheeting may reduce pruritus, hyperpigmentation, and discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acne-scars/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Silicone sheets are cut to the size of the scar and are worn for 12 hours per day for approximately two months. They may be applied as soon as skin re-epithelialization occurs. Adverse effects are rare and include pruritus and skin maceration. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other </strong>&ndash; Examples of less commonly employed therapies that may be useful for hypertrophic scars and keloids include surgical excision, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, and intralesional 5-fluorouracil.

Acne scars can lead to physical disfigurement and significant emotional distress. (See <a href=\"#H1751860122\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acne scars may be atrophic, hypertrophic, or keloidal. Atrophic acne scars constitute the most common presentation of acne scars. Atrophic acne scars can be divided into ice pick, rolling, and boxcar scars based upon morphology. (See <a href=\"#H1751860176\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thorough pre-treatment assessment is critical prior to acne scar treatment. In addition to a medical history and physical examination, a thorough discussion with the patient is essential to ensure that the treating clinician and patient have similar treatment expectations and treatment goals. Patient tolerance for treatment side effects and recovery time strongly influences the selection of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H106345512\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a wide variety of treatment options for atrophic acne scars, including therapies designed to remove or release fibrotic tissue, therapies to induce collagen remodeling, and therapies to fill defects. In patients with generalized atrophic facial acne scars, the best results are usually obtained through a multi-faceted approach to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1751860334\" class=\"local\">'Generalized atrophic facial acne scars'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our first step for the treatment of generalized atrophic facial acne scars consists of the treatment of scar erythema, which can often accentuate acne scars, and focal therapies to improve deep ice pick scars, deep boxcar scars, and other scars that are likely to be resistant to other treatments. (See <a href=\"#H1751860341\" class=\"local\">'Step 1: Treatment of erythema and challenging scars'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our second step for the treatment of generalized atrophic facial acne scars is a procedure designed to induce collagen remodeling in the dermis. Traditional ablative laser resurfacing is a highly effective collagen remodeling procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96513%7EDERM%2F96512%7EDERM%2F96514\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96513 graphicRef96512 graphicRef96514 \">picture 1A-C</a>). For patients who are willing to tolerate the risks, side effects, and recovery time associated with traditional ablative laser resurfacing, we suggest treatment with this therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1673615\" class=\"local\">'Step 2: Collagen remodeling procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who cannot tolerate traditional ablative laser resurfacing, nonablative fractional laser resurfacing is our preferred procedure. Medium-depth or deep chemical peels, dermabrasion, and skin-needling are additional examples of collagen remodeling procedures. (See <a href=\"#H1673615\" class=\"local\">'Step 2: Collagen remodeling procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may benefit from additional treatments following a collagen-remodeling procedure, such as additional laser treatments or injectable soft tissue fillers. (See <a href=\"#H1751860429\" class=\"local\">'Step 3: Adjunctive therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who desire treatment of isolated atrophic acne scars may benefit from a variety of focal procedures. The morphology of the scar dictates the appropriate procedure. (See <a href=\"#H1673936\" class=\"local\">'Individual atrophic acne scars'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of hypertrophic or keloidal acne scars differs from the management of atrophic acne scars. For these lesions, intralesional corticosteroid injection is the first-line treatment.
