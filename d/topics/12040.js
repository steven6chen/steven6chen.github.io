Seven types of OCA caused by mutations in different genes have been recognized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115427\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115427 \">table 1</a>). All types share reduced to absent pigmentation of skin, hair, and eyes, but the clinical phenotypes vary along a broad spectrum of disease severity. Some rare types of OCA caused by mutations in genes involved in lysosomal biogenesis are associated with systemic abnormalities such as a bleeding disorder (Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome) or a propensity to pyogenic infection (Chediak-Higashi syndrome). </p><p>The ocular manifestations, including reduced vision, photosensitivity, nystagmus, and strabismus, are the most debilitating aspect of OCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. They are associated with a reduction in melanin within the iris and retina and misrouting of the optic nerve fibers from the eye to the brain during development. Reduced skin pigmentation leads to photosensitivity, increased skin cancer risk, and social consequences of appearing different than others. Discrimination against individuals with albinism is more prominent in some parts of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and management of nonsyndromic OCA. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and Chediak-Higashi syndrome are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hermansky-pudlak-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chediak-higashi-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chediak-Higashi syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98384414\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall prevalence of albinism is estimated to be 1 in 17,000 to 1 in 20,000, with ample variations across ethnic groups and geographic regions. One in 70 individuals is estimated to carry an OCA-mutated allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In rare autosomal recessive disorders, parental consanguinity is increased. This phenomenon is well documented in certain populations with albinism, likely related to cultural norms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) is the most common type of albinism worldwide, due to its high prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa, where prevalence ranges from as low as 1 in 15,000 in Nigeria to as high as 1 in 1000 in selected Zimbabwean populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In Africans, OCA2 is almost always due to a common 2.7 kb interstitial deletion in the <em>OCA2</em> gene, related to a founder effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The estimated OCA2 prevalence in the United States is 1 in 36,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) has an overall prevalence of approximately 1 in 40,000 but is extremely uncommon in Africa and among African-Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. OCA1 and OCA2 are the most common types of albinism in the United States. Oculocutaneous albinism type 3 (OCA3) occurs in approximately 1 in 8500 African individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Oculocutaneous albinism type 4 (OCA4), first described in a Turkish patient, occurs in 5 to 8 percent of German patients with albinism and in 18 to 30 percent of Japanese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. </p><p>Among Chinese patients with albinism, approximately 70 percent have OCA1, 10 percent have OCA2, 13 percent have OCA4, and 2 percent have Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1 (HPS1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A Danish study of 62 OCA patients identified 26 percent with OCA1, 15 percent with OCA2, and 3 percent with OCA4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Oculocutaneous albinism type 5 (OCA5) has been reported in a Pakistani family, oculocutaneous albinism type 6 (OCA6) has been described in a Chinese cohort, and oculocutaneous albinism type 7 (OCA7) has been described in a family from the Faroe Islands and in a Lithuanian individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. The phenotypic spectrum and prevalence for OCA5, OCA6, and OCA7 have not been completely described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3965746195\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION AND TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classification of albinism by causative gene is preferred over older terms such as &quot;partial&quot; or &quot;complete&quot; albinism, &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;imperfect&quot; albinism, &quot;tyrosinase-positive&quot; or &quot;tyrosinase-negative&quot; albinism, and &quot;yellow mutant&quot; or &quot;rufous&quot; albinism. Seven nonsyndromic types of albinism, numbered as oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) to oculocutaneous albinism type 7 (OCA7), have been recognized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115427\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115427 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Syndromic OCA includes 10 types of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and Chediak-Higashi syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hermansky-pudlak-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chediak-higashi-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chediak-Higashi syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1016043942\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1738977410\"><span class=\"h2\">Defective melanin biosynthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OCA is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the melanin biosynthesis pathway, which include melanogenic enzymes (ie, tyrosinase [TYR], tyrosinase-related protein 1 [<em>TYRP1</em>]) and specific transport proteins found in melanosomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115427\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115427 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The pigmentation of the hair, skin, and eye depends upon enzymatic biosynthesis of melanin, a complex pigment that absorbs ultraviolet radiation and protects against sun-related skin damage, nonmelanoma skin cancers, and melanoma. The TYR enzyme catalyzes the first step in melanin biosynthesis by oxidizing L-tyrosine to DOPA (dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine). Melanin comprises two main types: eumelanin, colored brown or black, and pheomelanin, colored yellow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Individuals with albinism typically have reduced eumelanin but may have normal levels of pheomelanin in hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Melanin biosynthesis is compartmentalized within melanosomes, lysosome-like organelles within melanocytes. From the cutaneous basal layer, mature, pigment-filled melanosomes are transferred from melanocytes to keratinocytes by a poorly understood intercellular transfer process to give skin its color. Melanosomes mature through four stages, I through IV. Premelanosomes in stages I and II do not yet contain melanin, whereas stages III and IV are melanized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Gene mutations disrupting enzymes such as TYR in the melanin-synthetic pathway reduce skin, hair, and eye pigmentation. Syndromic forms of albinism with extracutaneous and extraocular features often result from gene mutations that disrupt the process of pigment transfer by interfering with the biogenesis of melanosomes and melanosome-related, critical organelles in other tissues, such as platelet-dense bodies in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome or lysosomes in Chediak-Higashi syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115427\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115427 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In humans, binocular vision requires some nerve fibers from each eye to cross to the opposite side of the brain at the optic chiasm. Several factors present during embryogenesis, including melanin, guide the development of retinal and vascular structures and the routing of ganglion cells in the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus and on to the occipital cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. When ocular melanin is deficient during embryogenesis, misrouting of the nerve fibers and abnormal foveal development occurs. Reduced visual acuity is likely due to a combination of factors (eg, foveal anatomy, nystagmus, optic nerve fiber misrouting). Melanocytes derived from the neuroectoderm, located in the posterior iris epithelium and the retinal pigment epithelium, are affected in albinism. Iris color is determined, in part, by the stromal melanocytes derived from the neural crest. Other pigments, such as lutein and xanthophyll, are present in the retina and are not affected in albinism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3217608818\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most types of OCA display autosomal recessive inheritance. There are seven subtypes of OCA (oculocutaneous albinism type 1 [OCA1] to oculocutaneous albinism type 7 [OCA7]) associated with distinct single gene mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115427\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115427 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>OCA1 is caused by mutations in the <em>TYR</em> gene at the 11q14.3-encoding TYR enzyme. OCA1 is further subdivided into two subtypes: oculocutaneous albinism type 1A (OCA1A, MIM #203100) and oculocutaneous albinism type 1B (OCA1B, MIM #606952). Individuals with OCA1A carry two null (severe) mutations resulting in the complete absence of TYR activity, which causes complete, lifelong absence of melanin pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115430\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115430 \">picture 1A</a>). OCA1A is therefore considered to be the more severe type of OCA. In contrast, individuals with OCA1B, who carry milder mutations that allow some residual function of TYR, are able to develop some hair and skin pigment with time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115432\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115432 \">picture 1B</a>). </p><p>Oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2, MIM #203200) is caused by a mutation in the <em>OCA2</em> (previously called <em>P</em>) gene, which encodes a pH-regulating protein to support melanogenesis. Oculocutaneous albinism type 3 (OCA3, MIM #203290) is caused by mutations in <em>TYRP1</em> at 9p23. Oculocutaneous albinism type 4 (OCA4, MIM #606574) is caused by mutations in the membrane-associated transporter protein gene (<em>MATP</em>). Oculocutaneous albinism type 5 (OCA5), described in a Pakistani family, has been linked to a locus on chromosome 4q24, but the mutated gene has not been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Oculocutaneous albinism type 6 (OCA6) is caused by mutations in <em>SLC24A5</em>, encoding a solute carrier protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Oculocutaneous albinism type 7 (OCA7), described in individuals from the Faroe Islands, is associated with mutations in <em>C10orf11</em>, a gene involved in melanocyte differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1800957928\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The number of epidermal and follicular melanocytes is normal in OCA. Melanosome development is altered in oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1). Postmortem eye examination of a 20-week fetus with presumed oculocutaneous albinism type 1A (OCA1A) showed only stage I or II melanosomes and absence of melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium (see <a href=\"#H1016043942\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above); mature melanosomes are normally present by week 7 gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Absence of the fovea and a rod-free zone was found with postmortem pathology of a young boy with presumed OCA1A; stage III melanosomes in the retinal pigment epithelium were normal but reduced in number [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Histopathology in an older woman with presumed OCA1A showed absent foveal development, and no melanosomes were identified in the retinal pigment epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Electron microscopic examination of skin samples of a 20-week-old fetus with OCA1 showed melanosomes only up to stage II, consistent with absent melanin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1738977410\" class=\"local\">'Defective melanin biosynthesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3841782894\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with OCA display wide phenotypic heterogeneity, ranging from an almost complete absence of skin, hair, and eye melanin pigmentation in those with oculocutaneous albinism type 1A (OCA1A); to a variable amount of brown pigmentation in oculocutaneous albinism type 1B (OCA1B), oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2), and oculocutaneous albinism type 4 (OCA4); or a reddish-brown pigmentation in oculocutaneous albinism type 3 (OCA3). The ocular manifestations, including congenital nystagmus, photophobia, iris translucency, reduced pigmentation of the retinal epithelium, foveal hypoplasia, and reduced visual acuity, are common to all types of OCA. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H984979118\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with all types of OCA present similar ocular changes, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced iris pigmentation.

Siblings with albinism often have similar ocular structure, but their visual acuity may differ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p>Infants may appear to be sensitive to bright light, closing their eyes or putting their chin down with exposure to bright light. This is likely due to light scattering within the eye, as light enters the eye not only through the pupil but also through the hypopigmented iris and sclera (due to hypopigmented retinal pigment epithelium) in albinism. They may show poor eye contact, representing a delay in visual development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/6,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,37</a>]. </p><p>Nystagmus typically appears between six and eight weeks after full-term birth; parents may misinterpret nystagmus as a preference to look to the side in &quot;side gaze,&quot; which may damp the nystagmus. The amplitude of nystagmus is greater in infants than older children or adults. </p><p>Older children tend to hold toys or books closely and may not identify their parents across a room unless they speak. School-age children move close to the board to see it. Adults with OCA report difficulty reading road signs or newspapers without magnification.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H585492263\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin and hair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with OCA have markedly hypopigmented skin and hair compared with other family members. Hypopigmentation is more easily identified in families with highly pigmented skin types. </p><p>Children with white hair and lashes at birth likely have oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115427\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115427 \">table 1</a>). White hair noted at birth may remain white in children with OCA1A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115430\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115430 \">picture 1A</a>) or may darken over time in those with OCA1B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115432\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115432 \">picture 1B</a>). Although individuals with OCA1A may appear to develop slight darkening of the hair due to shampoos and water minerals, their eyebrows and eyelashes remain white; evaluation of hair near the roots typically shows the continued absence of color. A gray or silver sheen of hair is characteristic of Chediak-Higashi syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115462\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115462 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chediak-higashi-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chediak-Higashi syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with OCA2 are typically born with blond or reddish-blond hair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115433\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115433 \">picture 1C</a>). OCA3 presents with either the rufous (red) or the brown OCA phenotype in African and African-American individuals. They have copper-red (reddish-brown) skin, ginger (yellowish-red) hair color, and diluted iris color. Caucasian patients with OCA3 are clinically similar to patients with OCA2.</p><p>With age, sun-exposed skin becomes rough and thickened with increased actinic keratoses. Solar lentigines (freckles) develop in patients able to synthesize some melanin.</p><p>Individuals with OCA have an increased risk of early-onset skin cancer, possibly by their teenage years. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer occurring in OCA patients, but basal cell carcinoma and melanoma also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3678605488\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1016043942\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with OCA display wide phenotypic heterogeneity, ranging from an almost complete absence of skin, hair, and eye pigmentation in those with oculocutaneous albinism type 1A (OCA1A) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115430\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115430 \">picture 1A</a>); to a variable amount of brown pigmentation in oculocutaneous albinism type 1B (OCA1B) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115432\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115432 \">picture 1B</a>), oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115433\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115433 \">picture 1C</a>), and oculocutaneous albinism type 4 (OCA4); or a reddish-brown pigmentation in oculocutaneous albinism type 3 (OCA3). Ocular findings common to all types of OCA include dilution of iris pigmentation, photosensitivity, reduced visual acuity, nystagmus, and foveal hypoplasia. (See <a href=\"#H3841782894\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical diagnosis of OCA is based upon the presence of skin, hair, and iris hypopigmentation, compared with family members and members of the same ethnic group, and characteristic ocular changes and vision abnormalities detected on ophthalmologic examination, including photophobia, nystagmus, iris transillumination, foveal hypoplasia, and reduced visual acuity. (See <a href=\"#H3077703172\" class=\"local\">'Clinical diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2984801227\" class=\"local\">'Ophthalmologic examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the ample phenotypic overlap of different OCA types, genetic testing is generally preferred for a precise diagnosis and is available for most types of OCA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115427\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115427 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1739674069\" class=\"local\">'Molecular diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with OCA involves strict sun protection beginning from infancy, a comprehensive eye examination early in life, and treatment of refractive errors with glasses or contact lenses. Support groups and information sources are available. (See <a href=\"#H1488132283\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with OCA have a normal range of intelligence and normal development, with the exception of some delay in visual maturation. The best-corrected visual acuity improves through the second decade of life for most affected individuals. Life expectancy is not reduced in nonsyndromic OCA, although mortality from skin cancer can be increased in populations with limited access to sun-protection measures. (See <a href=\"#H577944229\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with OCA need lifelong regular skin examination at 6- to 12-month intervals for early diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer. Ophthalmic follow-up within the first two years of life may be required at three- to six-month intervals to maintain appropriate optical correction. The frequency diminishes until school age, when annual eye examination is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H310842877\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oculocutaneous-albinism/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gr&oslash;nskov K, Ek J, Brondum-Nielsen K.
