In the revised nomenclature, this disease, which comprises 20 to 30 percent of patients with JIA, is included in the group termed &quot;childhood polyarthritis.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-juvenile-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of juvenile arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Therapy is directed toward treating the underlying inflammation of JIA and preventing complications associated with JIA (eg, joint damage) or the adverse effects of its treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Medications used in the treatment of polyarticular JIA have various mechanisms of action, some of which are unknown, but all suppress inflammation. First-line agents include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) and nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. Second-line drugs referred to as biologic DMARDs include anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) agents.</p><p>Although many parents and clinicians voice fear of potential side effects from medications, years of experience make it clear that there is far more to fear from the damage known to be caused by ongoing joint inflammation. The belief statement that children often &quot;grow out of JIA&quot; is incorrect and may lead to delays in appropriate therapy and poor outcomes. It is essential that clinicians make families aware of the fact that children with polyarticular JIA are unlikely to outgrow their disease since this myth may heavily influence the family's understanding of the risk-to-benefit ratio of medications.</p><p>The treatment of polyarticular JIA is reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, complications, and prognosis of polyarticular JIA are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516511664\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to the treatment of polyarticular JIA is reviewed here and is consistent with the approach outlined in the 2011 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Juvenile Arthritis Treatment Recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. One exception is that the biologic agents (tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors) are increasingly used earlier in the treatment course and for less severe disease. The specific agents are discussed in detail separately or in the sections below.

Patients with all but very mild disease activity are usually treated with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), initiated either at the time of diagnosis or after one to two months of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy due to ongoing signs and symptoms of active disease. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> is the traditional DMARD of choice. However, TNF inhibitor biologic agents are increasingly used earlier in the course of treatment, particular in patients with severe disease. Treatment of polyarticular JIA is individualized based upon disease activity and severity as well as patient preferences after reviewing the risks, benefits, and costs of the therapies.</p><p>This section reviews the approach to the patient in the first several months of treatment. When to taper medications in patients who have responded, as well as management of refractory or recurrent disease, are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H5061340\" class=\"local\">'Ongoing management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Low disease activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial treatment for patients with low disease activity is an NSAID such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every eight hours, maximum dose 3200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> (10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> in two divided doses, maximum dose 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> in two to three divided doses, maximum dose 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. NSAIDs reach full efficacy within two to three months but usually start to relieve symptoms within a few days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Continuation of NSAID monotherapy (without joint injection or other systemic medication) for longer than two months is inappropriate if there is active arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Those who have not responded to initial NSAID therapy within two weeks should have the initial NSAID discontinued and a second NSAID started. If there is still active arthritis after one to two months of NSAID therapy, the patient should be promptly advanced to a DMARD such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. A TNF inhibitor is added after six months of DMARD therapy in children with poor prognostic features and continued low disease activity. (See <a href=\"#H516510845\" class=\"local\">'Moderate disease activity'</a> below.)</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no way to predict which NSAID is most likely to benefit an individual patient. A process of trial and error must be used while keeping expectations appropriate. Patients should be aware that NSAIDs are useful for symptomatic relief of pain and stiffness, but they do not delay or prevent joint damage in JIA. Long-term safety data on NSAIDs are needed because potential adverse effects, especially cardiovascular events, may not appear until adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, an email survey of the pediatric rheumatology community found no recognized cases of children treated with NSAIDs who developed premature myocardial infarctions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516510845\"><span class=\"h3\">Moderate disease activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A DMARD, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, is started in addition to an NSAID in most patients with moderate disease activity since it is rare for NSAIDs alone to control the inflammatory process of polyarticular disease and chronic joint changes may occur if arthritis remains active. Infrequently, patients with moderate disease activity are initially treated with an NSAID alone for symptomatic relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Those children on NSAIDS alone who have continued moderate disease activity for more than one to two months are typically then started on methotrexate.</p><p>A biologic agent (TNF inhibitor, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>) is added after three months of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> therapy if there is persistent moderate to high disease activity or if there are poor prognostic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H696343584\" class=\"local\">'Poor prognostic features'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5061215\"><span class=\"h3\">High disease activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A DMARD is typically started without a trial of NSAIDs in patients with high disease activity because these children almost uniformly require more therapy than an NSAID alone. The initial DMARD is typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, but a biologic agent (TNF inhibitor) may be added earlier in the course of treatment (at the time of diagnosis or anytime thereafter) in patients with high disease activity or poor prognostic features (see <a href=\"#H696343584\" class=\"local\">'Poor prognostic features'</a> above). Some are also starting biologic and nonbiologic DMARDs simultaneously in an attempt to prevent joint damage during the time it takes for methotrexate to take effect. The decision whether to add a biologic upfront is also influenced by patient preferences and insurance restrictions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5060953\"><span class=\"h3\">Selecting a DMARD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) used to treat polyarticular JIA include the nonbiologic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>) and the biologic agents (eg, TNF inhibitors).</p><p>Of the DMARDs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> has been the standard therapy for children with polyarticular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/2,6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-9</a>]. The usual starting dose of methotrexate is 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> body surface area (BSA) per week. Methotrexate is effective for many patients, but it does not work quickly, usually taking four to eight weeks before demonstrating its benefits. The trial periods for methotrexate are customary because of the higher risks and costs associated with the biologic agents compared with methotrexate. However, biologic agents have a more rapid onset of action and appear to be more efficacious than methotrexate. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etanercept</a> is the first of the TNF inhibitors approved for clinical use, with a relatively large amount of data regarding long-term safety and efficacy. Standard dosing for etanercept is 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> once a week or 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> twice a week. Other TNF inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> have since been approved for use in polyarticular JIA. There are no data to indicate that one TNF inhibitor is more efficacious than another for polyarticular JIA. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Methotrexate'</a> below.)</p><p>The question as to whether TNF inhibitors, with their potentially faster onset of action and greater efficacy, should be used before <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> remains unresolved. There is also evidence that the combination of a TNF inhibitor and methotrexate is synergistic for the treatment of arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. These considerations must be balanced against the potential increased risk of opportunistic infections with the use of TNF inhibitors, especially when used as part of multiple drug therapy. Neither TNF inhibitor monotherapy nor TNF inhibitor plus methotrexate combination therapy increased the risk of infections during or resulting in hospitalization in comparison with methotrexate monotherapy in a large administrative database study of children with JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, there is not yet a clear answer to the question of whether benefits of biologic agents justify their significantly higher costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Ongoing studies aimed at identifying markers of response and risk factors for adverse events should improve selection of appropriate candidates for the use of biologic agents and help answer and resolve some of these important issues. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Methotrexate'</a> below.)</p><p>Many pediatric rheumatologists start with a biologic agent before or concurrent with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> in children with high disease activity or poor prognostic features (see <a href=\"#H696343584\" class=\"local\">'Poor prognostic features'</a> above) if there are no insurance restrictions with regard to starting a biologic before a trial of methotrexate. Earlier use of a TNF inhibitor is also indicated if poor prognostic features are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, children with longer disease duration, negative antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers, higher level of disability, and arthritis present in both wrists are less likely to respond to methotrexate alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and methotrexate is ineffective in predominantly axial arthritis.</p><p>Some centers are also using biologic agents, almost always with concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> therapy, with the goal of preventing additional joint damage during the period necessary for methotrexate to take effect. In a 2013 survey of 138 pediatric rheumatologists, 46 and 9 percent of providers stated that they would use a nonbiologic and a biologic DMARD as initial therapy for children with polyarticular arthritis with and without poor prognostic features, respectively, regardless of disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Less than 1 percent would start a biologic agent alone for polyarticular disease. Labeling indications for both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> (anti-TNF therapies) do not require failure to respond to methotrexate before their use in children with JIA. Ongoing trials should help clarify the optimum approach to new-onset polyarthritis in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9390825\" class=\"local\">'Biologic agents'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5061500\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional modes of treatment for polyarticular JIA include intra-articular glucocorticoids and physical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5061506\"><span class=\"h3\">Intra-articular glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intra-articular injections of glucocorticoids are both safe and effective for children with polyarticular JIA, and their use is recommended as needed for continued disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/2,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20,21</a>]. However, the need to repeatedly inject the same joint, or to inject multiple joints simultaneously, suggests that more effective systemic therapy is required. With the availability of anti-TNF agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>), the simultaneous injection of multiple joints is rarely necessary.</p><p>Injection of intra-articular glucocorticoids into a single inflamed joint, such as the hip or temporomandibular joint, is often dramatically effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. The injections are performed under general anesthesia in young children, or local anesthesia in older children, with computed tomography or ultrasound-guided imaging, or without imaging by an experienced clinician, depending upon the joint injected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-children-indications-technique-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in children: Indications, technique, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H696343720\"><span class=\"h3\">Folic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Folic acid</a> supplementation (400 mcg daily) is recommended for all children with JIA receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, given the beneficial effects noted and the lack of convincing contrary data. Some side effects such as glossitis and macrocytic anemia are often avoided by the addition of supplemental folic acid, started at the same time as methotrexate. Whether high doses of folic acid also diminish the effectiveness of methotrexate or cause side effects are topics of debate. Published articles report conflicting results regarding potential antagonism of the beneficial effects of methotrexate by folate supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Similarly, studies have shown both an increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and a decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] in the incidence of cancer among adults receiving folic acid supplementation.

Indications for using a TNF inhibitor in addition to or rather than methotrexate include severe cases of polyarthritis, presence of poor prognostic features, and presence of factors associated with poor response to methotrexate. An NSAID is used in combination with a DMARD for initial therapy in patients with moderate disease activity but is typically not used in patients with severe disease activity, because these children almost uniformly require more therapy than an NSAID alone.
