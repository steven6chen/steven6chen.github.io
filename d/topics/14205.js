About 10 to 20 percent of women with breast cancer have one or more first-degree relatives who are also affected with breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-brca1-and-brca2-mutations-and-associated-cancer-risks/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. While only 5 to 10 percent of unselected women with breast cancer have a hereditary form, up to 20 percent of women with a family history of breast cancer have a mutation in a major gene, most often in the breast cancer susceptibility genes 1 or 2 (<em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em>; hereafter, <em>BRCA</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-brca1-and-brca2-mutations-and-associated-cancer-risks/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Less frequently, breast or ovarian cancers may be associated with other familial risk syndromes, including Li-Fraumeni and Cowden syndromes.

In these patients, there are frequently several generations of women affected with breast cancer (often premenopausal) and, in some families, ovarian cancer as well. In addition, other <em>BRCA</em>-associated malignancies such as prostate, male breast, and pancreatic cancer may be observed.

Overall survival in women with triple-negative breast cancer and a germline <em>BRCA </em>mutation was slightly better than those without a <em>BRCA </em>mutation at two years, but there was no difference at 5 or 10 years.

For individuals whose ethnicity is associated with higher mutation frequency, particularly Ashkenazi Jews, any personal or family history of breast cancer is sufficient to warrant consideration of <em>BRCA</em> testing. Several founder mutations (ie, particular <em>BRCA</em> mutations occurring among defined ethnic groups or individuals from a specific geographic area) have been observed. Aside from Ashkenazi Jews, founder mutations have also been reported worldwide in populations from the Netherlands, Sweden, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, France, South Africa, Pakistan, Asia, and among French Canadians, Hispanics, and African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-brca1-and-brca2-mutations-and-associated-cancer-risks/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1039356803\"><span class=\"h2\">Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an unselected non-Jewish population in the United States, the chance of having any deleterious <em>BRCA</em> mutation is about 1 in 400 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-brca1-and-brca2-mutations-and-associated-cancer-risks/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Half of these carriers had no significant family history of breast or ovarian cancers. Their female relatives were then offered testing, which revealed 211 mutation carriers.
