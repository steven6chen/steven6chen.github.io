However, stimulants have also been used for decades as add-on treatment in patients with unipolar major depression who have not responded adequately to antidepressant monotherapy. In a retrospective study of patients with unipolar major depression who were treated with an antidepressant and then received augmentation therapy (n &gt;3200), stimulants were used in 5 percent of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-stimulants-and-stimulant-like-drugs/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>This topic reviews the efficacy of stimulants and stimulant-like drugs for augmentation of antidepressants in treatment-resistant, unipolar major depression. Choosing a drug regimen for treatment-resistant depression is discussed separately.

Options for add-on treatment include second-generation antipsychotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, triiodothyronine, a second antidepressant, and psychotherapy (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy). It is also thought that stimulants and stimulant-like drugs may be useful for patients with treatment-resistant depression because these drugs may ameliorate symptoms such as anergia, fatigue, hypersomnia, and impaired concentration, which are often initial or residual symptoms of major depression as well as side effects of some antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-stimulants-and-stimulant-like-drugs/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>In addition, it is biologically plausible that stimulants may be of value for treating depression when combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). The pathophysiology of major depression may involve insufficient monoaminergic neurotransmission, and SSRIs initially increase serotonergic activity and SNRIs increase serotonergic and noradrenergic activity.
