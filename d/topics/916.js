Other indications for pulmonary resection include management of thoracic trauma, pulmonary infection, and bronchopleural fistula.</p><p>Surgical procedures for these indications include sublobar resection (segmentectomy, wedge resection), lobectomy, or removal of more than one lobe (bilobectomy, lobectomy plus segmentectomy). A pneumonectomy involves removal of the entire lung. Extrapleural pneumonectomy involves resection of the diseased lung, as well as mediastinal lymph nodes, ipsilateral pericardium, hemidiaphragm, or parietal or visceral pleura.</p><p>This topic will review anesthetic care for patients undergoing thoracotomy and open pulmonary resection, including preanesthetic consultation and preparation, intraoperative anesthetic management, and postoperative pain management.

These are placed prior to induction of general anesthesia, while the patient is still in the supine position. After the airway has been secured, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) and intermittent airway pressures and volumes are monitored.</p><p>Invasive monitors used in patients undergoing major pulmonary resection procedures (eg, lobectomy or pneumonectomy) include an intra-arterial catheter and a bladder catheter. The intra-arterial catheter may be inserted before or after induction of anesthesia, while the bladder catheter is typically inserted after induction but before repositioning the patient for surgery. Healthy patients undergoing a short procedure (eg, simple wedge resection of a localized lesion in the pulmonary periphery) generally do not require either of these invasive monitors.</p><p>All noninvasive and invasive monitors are secured to avoid displacement during repositioning, surgical prepping, and draping. After positioning, access to these may be limited.</p><p>Unique considerations for noninvasive monitoring during open pulmonary resection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Electrocardiography (ECG)</strong> &ndash; ECG leads may become dislodged, inaccessible, wet with prep solution, or nonfunctional during repositioning (eg, to the lateral decubitus position). (See <a href=\"#H2000919988\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For left-sided thoracotomy cases, the V<sub>5</sub> lead is typically placed in the V<sub>1</sub> position, in the second interspace just to the right of the sternum, to avoid contamination of the surgical field. Sensitivity of ECG monitoring for ischemic events may be reduced when the combination of leads II and V<sub>5</sub> is unavailable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Some clinicians place two pulse oximetry probes (eg, on two extremities) during final positioning. However, direct measurement of PaO<sub>2 </sub>via arterial blood gas measurements provides a more useful estimate of the margin of safety above desaturation (ie, SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;90 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Capnography</strong> &ndash; Continuous capnography aids in maintaining adequate ventilation and may detect malposition of the double-lumen tube (DLT) or bronchial blocker. However, large gradients between arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and end-tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>(ETCO<sub>2</sub>) are common in patients with preexisting pulmonary disease, and this gradient worsens during OLV. Thus, intermittent arterial blood gas analysis is also used to detect hypercarbia during OLV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>NIBP cuff </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>A loose-fitting cuff may become dislodged and nonfunctional during patient repositioning. (See <a href=\"#H2000919988\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Monitoring with an intra-arterial catheter includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure (BP)</strong> &ndash; Hemodynamic instability due to compression of the heart or major vessels, hemorrhage, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or high airway pressures is immediately recognized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intermittent sampling for arterial blood gases </strong>&ndash; Intermittent arterial blood gas analysis for direct measurement of PaO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub> is important in patients at risk for desaturation during procedures requiring OLV. Measurements are obtained during two lung ventilation (baseline) following induction of general anesthesia and every 15 to 60 minutes during OLV, as needed. Final measurements are obtained after completion of lung resection and reexpansion of the nonventilated lung in order to assess respiratory reserve before extubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respirophasic variations in the arterial pressure waveform</strong> &ndash; Dynamic hemodynamic parameters based on analysis of respirophasic variation in the continuous arterial pressure waveform during positive pressure ventilation are often used to provide goal-directed therapy for major surgical procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F86275\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86275 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F85850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85850 \">table 1</a>).

Typically, a DLT is inserted as part of the induction and endotracheal intubation sequence, or a single-lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) is initially inserted with subsequent placement of a bronchial blocker. Final positioning of these devices is accomplished with fiberoptic bronchoscopic guidance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-isolation-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung isolation techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The choice of lung isolation device and appropriate preparations depend on the nature and specific location of the planned resection, upper and lower airway anatomy, need for lung protection in patients with unilateral pulmonary infection or bleeding, and practitioner skill and preference. Also, the likelihood of postoperative controlled ventilation is considered. A single-lumen ETT with a bronchial blocker has an advantage in this situation compared with a DLT because the bronchial blocker can be withdrawn at the end of surgery, leaving the single-lumen ETT in place for the postoperative period. (See <a href=\"#H1605458047\" class=\"local\">'Final bronchoscopy and emergence'</a> below.)</p><p>Advantages and disadvantages for devices used to achieve OLV and the clinical approach to device selection are discussed in detail separately.

We suggest a technique based upon the potent volatile inhalation anesthetic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> as the primary agent for maintenance of anesthesia, and we administer supplemental intravenous (IV) agents such as an opioid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, and a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA). One randomized study in 180 patients undergoing lung resection surgery demonstrated a lower incidence of mortality in the first year with a sevoflurane-based anesthetic technique compared with a propofol-based total intravenous anesthetic (TIVA) technique (2.3 versus 12.5 percent; OR 5.37, 95% CI 1.23-23.54) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Also, fewer postoperative pulmonary complications were noted in the sevoflurane group (14 versus 28 percent; odds ratio [OR] 2.44, 95% CI 1.14-5.26), as well as reduced expression of lung and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, in another randomized trial in 460 patients undergoing lung resection surgery with one lung ventilation, use of a desflurane-based anesthetic was not associated with a significant reduction in complications, compared with a propofol-based TIVA technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The bronchodilatory and antiinflammatory effects of potent volatile agents, and rapid elimination during emergence may be advantageous in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although anesthetic techniques with inhalation agents have been associated with lower long-term survival compared with TIVA in one propensity-matched retrospective analysis of patients with any type of cancer, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown for lung cancer specifically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Maintenance and emergence&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If a thoracic epidural catheter was placed prior to induction, a local anesthetic agent may be administered to supplement inhalation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IV general anesthetic agents. Use of epidural anesthesia to supplement general anesthesia does not have a clinically significant effect on oxygenation during OLV. This option is often used in hemodynamically stable patients if they have a high anesthetic requirement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles#H90539903\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;, section on 'General versus combined thoracic epidural/general anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>We typically administer 5 mL of 0.2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a> or 0.125% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> as a bolus, with readministration approximately every 45 minutes if BP is stable.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H795595600\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and opioids'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Occasionally, discontinuation of TEA becomes necessary due to hypotension caused by infusion of local anesthetic or adverse effects of epidural opioids such as respiratory depression, urinary retention, and delayed gastric emptying. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H795595941\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Side effects and complications of neuraxial analgesia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1614783810\"><span class=\"h2\">Paravertebral block</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advantages and disadvantages </strong>&ndash; Compared with TEA, catheter-based PVB with continuous infusion of a local anesthetic agent provides comparable analgesia and may be associated with fewer adverse side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection/abstract/46,51,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,51,56-58</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1521347683\" class=\"local\">'Choice of technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When PVB is performed in the preoperative period, injection of local anesthetic may be used to supplement general anesthesia during the intraoperative period, with effectiveness similar to that of thoracic epidural. Although catheter insertion for PVB may be performed prior to induction of anesthesia, an alternative is direct placement by the surgeon in the open chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. This flexibility is advantageous when the surgical plan is changed (eg, when video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [VATS] surgery is initiated, but intraoperative conversion to an open thoracotomy becomes necessary). Another advantage is that open placement on the surgical field may be safely performed in patients with impaired coagulation. In some institutions, operating room efficiency is facilitated by intraoperative placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Disadvantages of PVB include lack of familiarity for many anesthesiologists. Failure may occur due to technical difficulty with catheter placement (even with successful needle placement within the paravertebral space) or insufficient spread within the paravertebral space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection/abstract/66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-69</a>]. However, reported failure rate is low for experienced clinicians: approximately 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection/abstract/56,57,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57,68,69</a>].

We often select intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> as a component of an enhanced recovery protocol that employs mostly non-opioid analgesic therapies to reduce the overall opioid requirement. However, since intrathecal morphine may cause delayed respiratory depression, postoperative monitoring for inadequate oxygenation and ventilation is necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection/abstract/46,51,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,51,77</a>].</p><p>Although these alternative regional techniques provide effective short-term analgesia, analgesic duration is typically insufficient. Thus, achieving adequate pain control in a patient with a large thoracotomy incision may require additional intrathecal opioid boluses, use of a liposomal formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> for intercostal nerve blocks to provide extended slow release of the local anesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>], or initiation of PCA with intravenous systemic opioids. &#160;</p><p>Although less severe than incisional pain, ipsilateral shoulder pain (ISP) frequently occurs following pulmonary resection, described as a dull, stabbing pain of moderate to severe intensity in the region of the deltoid muscle and lateral clavicle on the side of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection/abstract/79-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-82</a>].

Equipment and devices to achieve one lung ventilation (OLV), hemodynamic monitoring, and fluid warming are also prepared. (See <a href=\"#H642462394\" class=\"local\">'Preanesthetic preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to standard noninvasive monitoring, patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy require an intra-arterial catheter for continuous monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and respirophasic variations in the arterial pressure waveform, as well as intermittent arterial blood gas sampling. A bladder catheter is inserted to monitor urine output and temperature. Other invasive monitoring techniques are used selectively. (See <a href=\"#H2293088452\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a technique based upon the potent volatile inhalation anesthetic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> as the primary agent for maintenance of anesthesia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>), and we administer supplemental intravenous (IV) agents such as an opioid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, and a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA). Anesthetic choices (eg, inhalation versus IV agents, intraoperative use of epidural agents versus none) do not affect oxygenation during OLV.

It is particularly important to reassess the integrity of the endotracheal tube (ETT) and correct positioning of the lung isolation device (double-lumen tube [DLT] or bronchial blocker) after any position change. (See <a href=\"#H2000919988\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest intraoperative fluid restriction to 1.5 to 2 L, with goal-directed crystalloid fluid therapy to maintain normovolemia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>); this strategy may reduce pulmonary complications. All fluids are warmed to avoid hypothermia.
