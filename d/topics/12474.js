(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-neck-pain-or-injury#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the child or adolescent athlete with neck pain or injury&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>In a review of 1447 spine fractures treated at two Canadian centers, 14 percent of the fractures, but 23 percent of the injuries with neurologic deficit, were sustained during sporting and recreational activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among the 202 fractures that occurred during recreational activity, diving accounted for 21 percent, and snowmobiling, <span class=\"nowrap\">parachuting/skydiving,</span> and equestrian events accounted for 10 percent each. Nearly one-fourth of the fractures were sustained in high-velocity winter sports (eg, snowmobiling, tobogganing, Alpine skiing, and ice hockey).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Atlas (C1) fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Axial loading of the cervical spine can cause two types of fractures of the atlas, known as Jefferson fractures: posterior arch fractures and burst fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior arch fractures are more common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63483\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63483 \">image 1</a>); with bracing, they typically heal well with fibrous or bony union.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burst fractures involve disruption of both the anterior and posterior arches, which may allow progressive displacement of the lateral masses of the atlas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66040\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66040 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51760 \">figure 1</a>), leading to vascular and neurologic compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>Patients with Jefferson fractures have neck pain and restricted range of motion of the neck, but they usually have a normal neurologic examination. Prompt and careful evaluation is critical to avoid a delay in diagnosis and secondary neurologic compromise.</p><p>Open-mouth odontoid views are helpful in establishing the diagnosis. A fracture is suggested by an increased periodontoid space and bilateral symmetrical overhang of the lateral masses of the atlas (C1) in relation to the axis (C2). When the transverse diameter of the atlas is 7 mm greater than that of the axis, a transverse ligament rupture should be suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Subluxation and dislocation'</a> below.)</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) scans provide excellent detail of the atlas, and are helpful in confirming bony injuries and excluding rupture of the transverse alar ligament (which makes the spine unstable) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, CT scans are recommended in patients in whom C1 fractures are suspected, but whose plain radiographs are normal or inconclusive.</p><p>The majority of atlas fractures heal with nonoperative immobilization techniques (eg, a halo brace). However, surgical fusion is occasionally necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Axis (C2) fractures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Odontoid fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct head impact can cause fractures of the odontoid (also called the dens), the toothlike projection from the upper surface of the axis (C2). These fractures can occur at the tip or base of the odontoid. Avulsion fractures of the tip are less common, but more stable, whereas fractures of the base have a higher rate of nonunion with nonsurgical treatment.</p><p>Odontoid fractures usually displace anteriorly with posterior angulation of the dens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Displaced odontoid fractures can be identified on lateral radiographs, but nondisplaced fractures and fractures in children may be difficult to visualize. As a general rule, CT scan is recommended in any patient with confirmed or suspected C2 fracture.</p><p>Similar to atlas fractures, stable odontoid fractures are usually managed nonsurgically. After 6 to 10 weeks of healing, lateral flexion and extension radiographs should be obtained to verify union [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Unstable fractures and those that fail to heal satisfactorily require surgical fusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The prognosis for complete neurologic recovery is good provided that the initial injury does not compromise the brainstem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Hangman's fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hangman's fracture (spondylolisthesis of C2) is a fracture of the pedicle of the axis, usually resulting from a hyperextension injury. The name is derived from the similar injury suffered during execution-style hangings. Most hangman's fractures result from hyperextension sustained during a motor vehicle accident, but they also occur in diving accidents and headlong falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Despite marked anterior displacement of C2 on C3, minimal or no spinal cord injury may result if the victim survives the initial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Patients with hangman's fractures present with neck pain and often have no neurologic symptoms or signs. Diagnosis is established with radiographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64511\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64511 \">image 3</a>) and CT.</p><p>Most cases can be successfully treated with immobilization with a halo vest. Traction alone should be avoided because it increases the potential for nonunion and more serious neurologic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Surgical fusion is indicated if there is nonunion or disruption of the C2-C3 disk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical compression fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vertebral body compression fractures are injuries caused by axial loading with or without cervical flexion or extension. Axial loading occurs when the athlete uses the head in blocking or tackling, or hits the bottom of a body of water after diving into water that is too shallow.</p><p>The presenting symptoms of compression fractures depend upon the severity as described below. The presentation of mild fractures (types I and II) may be limited to neck pain and cervical spasm. Depending upon the location of the lesion, more severe fractures (types III-V) can cause respiratory arrest and quadriplegia.</p><p>Most compression fractures are identified by plain radiographs and further clarified by CT. Compression fractures may be classified into five types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I injuries are simple <strong>wedge</strong> compression fractures of the cervical vertebrae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55806\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55806 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63517\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63517 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77831 \">figure 2</a>). They are stable fractures that heal well with conservative management (8 to 10 weeks in a semirigid cervical collar) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], usually without neurologic sequelae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II compression fractures are &quot;<strong>teardrop</strong>,&quot; or <strong>isolated</strong> anterior-inferior vertebral body fractures with intact posterior elements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74721\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74721 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66513\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66513 \">figure 3</a>). The extension teardrop fracture occurs when abrupt neck extension causes the anterior longitudinal ligament to pull the anteroinferior corner away from the remainder of the vertebral body, producing a triangular-shaped fragment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62966\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62966 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54792\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54792 \">figure 4</a>). Like type I injuries, most of these injuries are stable and treated conservatively (8 to 10 weeks in a semirigid cervical collar) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. However, <span class=\"nowrap\">flexion/extension</span> radiographs should be taken after immobilization to evaluate cervical spine stability. In one study of 27 patients with apparently simple compression fractures, six had cervical spine instability diagnosed on follow-up radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III fractures are <strong>comminuted burst</strong> vertebral body fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69127\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69127 \">image 8</a>). The posterior elements remain intact, but bony fragments may be displaced into the spinal medullary canal, resulting in serious neurologic injury. These should be evaluated with CT, and surgical stabilization is needed to prevent late movement of the bone fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. One variant of this type of fracture is the axial load teardrop fracture. Axial load teardrop fractures must be distinguished from isolated teardrop fractures (described above), which are not usually associated with permanent neurologic sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Types IV and V are complex vertebral fractures involving the posterior elements. They are unstable fractures with a poor prognosis, and often result in quadriplegia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical spinous process fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spinous process fracture, also called the clay shoveler's fracture, is an avulsion fracture of the tip of the spinous process, most commonly involving C7 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79308\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79308 \">image 9</a>). These injuries were classically seen as a result of vigorous labor and forceful contraction of the shoulder muscles. Now they are more commonly seen following trauma from an assault or motor vehicle accident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Fractures of the spinous process are typically painful. However, unless they involve the base of the spinous process, these fractures are stable and usually heal well spontaneously. Treatment consists of cervical collar immobilization for pain relief. Range of motion is withheld until the fracture site is nontender (usually within four to six weeks), at which time dynamic radiographs can be performed to evaluate cervical spine stability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Return to play</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations for return to play after a cervical spine fracture are discussed separately.

In the alert and cooperative patient, <span class=\"nowrap\">F/E</span> imaging may play a role, particularly if MRI is unavailable. To prevent inadvertent injury to the spinal cord, flexion and extension should be actively performed by the patient in a methodical, slow fashion and only to the point of pain or neurologic symptoms. Findings on flexion-extension views that are consistent with ligamentous injury include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motion of the vertebral body relative to its position on the plain lateral view (more than 3.5 mm horizontal displacement between adjacent disks) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior intervertebral disk-space narrowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior angulation and displacement of the vertebral body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fanning of the spinous processes</p><p/><p>Any patient who has positive findings on <span class=\"nowrap\">flexion/extension</span> views should undergo MRI imaging and neurosurgical consultation. In addition, MRI may show damage to the supporting posterior soft tissues.</p><p>Most cases of significant vertebral subluxation require aggressive treatment with posterior cervical fusion to prevent chronic instability and risk of future injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute atlantoaxial instability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute atlantoaxial instability (AAI) is usually the result of trauma that forces the neck into extreme flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This causes disruption (or rupture) of the transverse ligament of the odontoid process, allowing the odontoid process to move posteriorly and compress the spinal cord.</p><p>The diagnosis of AAI is made on lateral radiographs of the cervical spine when the space between the posterior aspect of the anterior arch of the atlas and the anterior aspect of the odontoid process is greater than 5 mm in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and greater than 3 mm in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Acute AAI is an unstable injury that requires definitive treatment (ie, posterior fusion of C1 and C2).

The incidence of cervical disc disease increases with age. It typically occurs after the mid-30s, but can occur in younger individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, some sports, including football, wrestling, and rugby, increase the incidence of cervical disc problems over the lifetime of the athlete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main mechanisms by which a cervical disc causes symptoms: acute disc herniation and degenerative disc disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute disc herniation tends to occur in the younger individual and is more likely to be associated with an identifiable injury. The inciting event may range from a high-impact trauma to simple twisting of the neck during normal daily activities, which causes acute herniation of the nucleus pulposus posterolaterally into the nerve root or spinal cord. The most common areas of disc herniation are the C5-C6 and C6-C7 levels, followed by C4-C5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The other, more common mechanism of injury is degenerative disc disease. Cervical spondylosis, or narrowing of the neural foramina or spinal canal, results from progressive degeneration of the cervical disc in conjunction with osteophyte formation. These disc changes result in disc space narrowing and bulging or herniation of the degenerative nuclear contents. Secondary osteophytes and spurring at the intervertebral, uncovertebral, and facet joints are caused by the altered mechanics of cervical motion. This process, which is more insidious in onset, tends to occur at the same levels affected by acute disc herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p>The prevalence of degenerative disc disease is about 10 percent in people in their mid-20s, and progresses linearly to 95 to 100 percent by age 70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with acute disc herniation complain of sudden onset of posterior neck pain. Neck pain may be the only presenting symptom, but some patients have referred pain to the shoulder, periscapular area, arm, or hand, depending upon the location of the disc herniation and the nerve roots involved. More classic neurologic symptoms such as numbness, paresthesias, muscle weakness, and diminished reflexes in the distribution of the affected spinal nerve may also be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63597 \">table 2</a>). Patients with spinal cord impingement, which is less common, may have gait disturbance, lower-extremity neurologic symptoms and weakness, or loss of normal <span class=\"nowrap\">bowel/bladder</span> function. Patients with degenerative disc disease typically have similar symptoms, but a more insidious onset, than those with acute herniation.</p><p>Physical examination usually reveals a combination of spasm, tenderness, and decreased range of motion of the neck. A neurologic examination of the upper and lower extremities should be performed to locate deficits of sensation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53006 \">figure 5</a>), strength, or reflexes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63597 \">table 2</a>). The presence of impaired neurologic function helps to localize the lesion. The axial compression and Spurling test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52401\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52401 \">picture 1</a>) may be positive, exacerbating the patient's neurologic symptoms. Although these tests are specific for radiculopathy, they lack sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

In addition, they may provide some clues to the presence of disc disease including disc space narrowing, foraminal narrowing, or osteophytes.</p><p>MRI is the study of choice to evaluate cervical disc disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58981\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58981 \">image 14</a>). It is used to confirm disease when the diagnosis is in question and to plan for invasive treatment such as surgery. MRI abnormalities must be correlated with clinical presentation since MRI evidence of cervical disc disease may be present in asymptomatic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of cervical disc disease can be managed conservatively. Initial treatment consists of pain management and functional improvement with NSAIDS, moist heat, massage, and relative <span class=\"nowrap\">rest/activity</span> modification.</p><p>A soft cervical collar may help by providing partial immobilization and a reminder of activity restrictions. Intermittent traction may be useful if radiculopathy is present, particularly if the distraction test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61568\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61568 \">picture 2</a>) relieves the patient's symptoms.</p><p>Once pain and function have improved, the patient should begin a physical therapy program for rehabilitation. Improved range of motion and strength of the neck and shoulder muscles are important to the long-term success of treatment. Selective nerve root injections with anesthetic and steroids under fluoroscopy may be a useful adjunct if physical therapy fails to yield acceptable results.</p><p>Indications for surgical treatment of cervical disc disease include severe neurologic symptoms, failure to improve despite appropriate conservative management, or worsening neurologic symptoms during treatment. In the absence of severe neurologic symptoms, surgery is usually not considered until six to eight weeks of conservative management have failed. Surgical options include laminoforaminotomy with limited disc excision or discectomy and fusion. The latter approach has been shown to relieve radicular symptoms in more than 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Return to play</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Return to play for athletes with cervical disc disease depends upon the presence of symptoms and, if surgery was necessary, the level and extent of spinal fusion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The athlete with symptomatic cervical disc disease must be held out of all contact sports (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71147\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71147 \">table 1</a>) until the symptoms have resolved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The athlete may return to play without restrictions if conservative treatment results in complete resolution of pain, restoration of normal painless range of motion, normal strength, and the athlete has no other contraindication to participation (eg, cervical stenosis or spear tackler's spine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Athletes with single-level fusion may return to play provided the fusion is solid and the patient is asymptomatic.

Isolated strains and sprains do not involve injury to the nerves or bones. They are most often caused by automobile accidents, falls, and injuries sustained in contact-collision sports and recreational activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Patients with isolated cervical strains or sprains complain of cervical pain without radiation or neurologic symptoms. On examination, they may have limitation of cervical range of motion and muscular spasm or tenderness. The neurologic examination is normal.</p><p>Because of the potential for dangerous injury to the cervical spine after trauma to the neck, all neck injuries must be evaluated with diligence and caution. An athlete who has worrisome symptoms or findings on physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76379\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76379 \">table 3</a>) after an acute neck injury should have his or her cervical spine immobilized until radiographic evaluation is complete.

When pain and range of motion have improved, management should focus on rehabilitation deficits in strength as flexibility.

Whiplash has been defined as an acceleration-deceleration injury to the cervical spine most commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents, specifically from rear-end or side impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Such injuries may also occur in football, hockey, and rugby players. The mechanism of injury seems to be strong compressive and translational forces on the joints and soft tissues, resulting in an abnormal S-shaped movement pattern of the lower cervical spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Affected patients typically present with head, neck, and upper thoracic pain and decreased range of motion. The symptoms occur at the time of injury, and they may continue to worsen over the following 48 hours. This delayed worsening of symptoms often prompts the patient to seek treatment several days after the injury. They may have cervical muscle spasm, but neurologic signs and symptoms are usually lacking. Symptoms are often out of proportion to objective findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Some studies suggest that whiplash is more akin to a functional disorder that is often encouraged by economic gains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. The most common radiographic findings are preexisting degenerative changes or decreased lordosis of the cervical spine secondary to spasm and disuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].
