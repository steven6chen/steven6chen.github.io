This topic review will focus on the risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment of post-ERCP perforation. An overview of the complications of ERCP and detailed discussions of other individual complications are presented separately.

The Stapfer classification is most commonly used and is based on the mechanism, anatomical location, and severity of the injury that may predict the need for surgical intervention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113305 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I: Free bowel wall perforation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II: Retroperitoneal duodenal perforation secondary to periampullary injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III: Perforation of the pancreatic or bile duct</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IV: Retroperitoneal air alone</p><p/><p>Of these, retroperitoneal duodenal perforations are the most common. In a case series of 44 post-ERCP perforations, 30 (68 percent) were retroperitoneal duodenal perforations, which usually occur as a result of a sphincterotomy that extends beyond the intramural portion of bile duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Perforation of the pancreatic or bile duct usually occurs following dilation of strictures, forceful cannulation, guidewire insertion, stent migration, or difficult stone extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/4-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-12</a>]. Liver and pancreatic parenchymal perforation by the guidewire during ERCP is an under-appreciated complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and subcapsular liver hematoma and subcapsular biloma can occur in this context. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rare complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Free abdominal perforation of the duodenum or jejunum is rare, usually occurring in patients with a stricture or anomalous anatomy, such as Billroth II gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].

While most patients with Type II perforations were medically managed, four patients from this group (7 percent) required surgical intervention.</p><p>Gastric and esophageal perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/4,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18,19</a>] and pneumomediastinum without evidence of perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] have also been described after ERCP and sphincterotomy. Intestinal perforation related to biliary stents is an uncommon complication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rare complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27381591\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retroduodenal perforation was reported in 0.5 to 2.1 percent of sphincterotomies in a number of older large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The incidence of perforation has appeared to decrease to less than 0.5 percent, probably because of improvement in experience and skill of endoscopists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, severe and fatal cases continue to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In a summary of 21 prospective studies involving 16,855 patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) between 1987 and 2003, post-ERCP perforations totaled 101 (0.60 percent), with 10 deaths (0.06 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Numerous primarily retrospective studies published have described perforation rates following ERCP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F102224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102224 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/1-4,11,12,26-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,11,12,26-49</a>]. Overall, the risk of perforation following ERCP is approximately 0.4 percent, with a mortality rate of approximately 7 to 8 percent. Type I perforations account for 25 percent of perforations, type II for 46 percent, type III for 22 percent, and type IV for 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27381598\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of patient- and procedure-related risk factors for perforation have been identified in individual reports and in large series. A difficulty with interpreting the risk factors identified in these reports is that many of the studies combined free bowel wall perforation at a site remote from the papilla (endoscope-related) and periampullary retroperitoneal perforation (sphincterotomy-related). The mechanisms leading to the different types of perforations are substantially different. Furthermore, the absolute number of patients studied is small, reflecting the infrequent occurrence of these complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27381605\"><span class=\"h2\">All perforations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following risk factors for free abdominal or retroperitoneal perforation were identified in a large retrospective case-control study that included 33 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-related perforations out of 9314 ERCP procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient-related risk factors included sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and a dilated common bile duct. Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction has also been recognized as a risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]; however, it is usually in conjunction with a small, rather than a dilated, common bile duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. A possible explanation for this difference is that the dilated common bile duct in one series was due to a distal common bile duct stricture, and the increased risk of perforation in this group was related to the manipulations carried out to obtain deep cannulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedure-related risk factors included performance of a sphincterotomy, longer duration of the procedure, and biliary stricture dilation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27381612\"><span class=\"h2\">Bowel wall perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of bowel wall perforation is increased in patients who have stenosis in the upper gastrointestinal tract or bile ducts, and in patients with abnormal gastrointestinal anatomy, such as gastrectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy, situs inversus, or periampullary diverticula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/14,15,17,27,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,17,27,52</a>]. Particular caution is required with the use of a side-viewing duodenoscope (the endoscope typically used for ERCP) in patients with a Billroth II gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) after Billroth II reconstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27381619\"><span class=\"h2\">Retroperitoneal perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of retroperitoneal perforation is increased with precut sphincterotomy and larger sphincterotomies, particularly those that are created outside of the usually recommended landmarks (11 to 1 o'clock) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>]. In one report, 7 of 13 sphincterotomy perforations were related to precutting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=precut-access-papillotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Precut (access) papillotomy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Retroperitoneal perforation can also occur after ampullectomy. In a retrospective Italian study between 1999 and 2011, an ampullectomy had been performed in 7 out of 30 cases (23 percent) of duodeno-pancreato-biliary perforations reported after ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampullary-adenomas-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ampullary adenomas: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other risk factors identified in individual reports include a small caliber bile duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], the presence of a peripapillary diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/56,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,60</a>], and intramural injection of contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349490593\"><span class=\"h2\">Biliopancreatic ductal perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary stricture dilation increases the risk of biliopancreatic perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/4,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Free abdominal perforation (type I perforation) is almost always recognized immediately based upon clinical symptoms, physical signs, and fluoroscopic findings. By contrast, retroduodenal perforation (type II) is usually determined by radiologic evidence of air (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113307\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113307 \">image 1</a>) or contrast in the retroperitoneal space outside the confines of the bile duct and duodenum during ERCP or computed tomographic (CT) evaluation for post-ERCP pain. However, type II perforations may be evident endoscopically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64568\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64568 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p>A retrospective series of ERCPs performed between 2010 and 2014 that included 61 type I or II duodenal perforations found that the diagnosis was made during the procedure in six patients (10 percent) and after the procedure in 54 patients (90 percent). The mean time to diagnosis was <span class=\"nowrap\">24(+/-13)</span> hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, other studies suggest that the rate of detection during ERCP may be higher. In a review of 18 studies performed between 2000 and 2013 with a total of 437 perforations, the diagnosis was made during ERCP in 321 cases (73 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>Patients with undetected leaks can present hours after the procedure with pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/20,62-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,62-66</a>]. Pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>] and gas in the portal system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>] have also been rarely described. Case reports have documented patients who developed pneumoretroperitoneum, pneumoperitoneum, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and subcutaneous emphysema following ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/69-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-72</a>]. Indeed, an anatomic continuum exists between the retroperitoneum, pneumoperitoneum, mediastinum, pneumothorax, and subcutaneous tissues. As a result, ectopic air in one of these compartments can extend to distant communicating spaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>An abdominal CT scan should be obtained in patients who are suspected of having a perforation, even if they do not have evidence of retroperitoneal air on plain films, since CT scan is the most sensitive means for detecting perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. The clinical or radiographic amount of air does not always indicate the size of the perforation or correlate with the severity of the complication, but rather reflects the degree of manipulation after the perforation occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/74,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Retroperitoneal air in asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, perforation is typically associated with the presence of retroperitoneal air, which can be detected by plain radiographs or CT. However, retroperitoneal air may also develop following sphincterotomy in patients who are clinically asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/75,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,77</a>]. Such patients may not require intervention. This was illustrated in a series of 21 patients studied prospectively who underwent an abdominal CT scan following sphincterotomy. Retroperitoneal air was observed in six (29 percent) patients, all of whom were asymptomatic and had an uneventful postprocedural course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. No clinical or procedure-related characteristics predicted the presence of air.</p><p>The origin of retroperitoneal air in such patients is presumably related to dissection through an injured or macroscopically intact bowel, which has also been described after colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>], although sealed microperforations are also possible. These findings suggest that the presence of retroperitoneal air in the absence of symptoms should warrant careful observation but may not require intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Retroperitoneal perforation associated with pancreatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The finding of retroperitoneal air may be challenging in patients who are symptomatic following sphincterotomy in whom a distinction needs to be made between perforation, clinically insignificant retroperitoneal air, and pancreatitis, particularly since pancreatitis and perforation can have a similar clinical presentation or occur simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/68,74,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,74,80</a>]. This was illustrated in a study that included 36 patients who developed prolonged abdominal pain following sphincterotomy and underwent a diagnostic CT scan. Complications included acute pancreatitis in 23 patients (64 percent), duodenal perforation in 11 (31 percent), and both pancreatitis and duodenal perforation in six patients (17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In a series that included 61 type I or II duodenal perforations, concurrent post-ERCP pancreatitis was diagnosed in 26 patients (43 percent) and was associated with increased mean length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In another series, two of three perforations in patients with Billroth II anatomy were associated with acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-ercp-perforation/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. The diagnosis of retroperitoneal duodenal perforation associated with pancreatitis should be based upon the detection of retroperitoneal air or contrast in a symptomatic patient meeting criteria for post-ERCP pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)

Over time, the incidence of perforation has appeared to decrease to less than 0.5 percent, probably because of improvement in experience and skill of the endoscopists.

By contrast, retroduodenal perforation is usually determined by the radiologic evidence of air or contrast in the retroperitoneal space outside the confines of the bile duct and duodenum during computed tomographic (CT) evaluation for post-ERCP pain. Perforation is rarely evident endoscopically.
