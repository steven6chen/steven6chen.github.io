Untreated chlamydial and gonococcal infection may result in pelvic inflammatory disease, which can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain in 10 to 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. STIs can also result in adverse outcomes in pregnancy, including spontaneous abortion, still birth, premature birth, and congenital infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Finally, the presence of STIs can facilitate HIV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Thus, primary prevention of STIs needs to be given high priority.</p><p>The comprehensive approach to STI prevention is based on five major strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accurate risk assessment, with education and counseling of at-risk individuals on ways to avoid STIs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-exposure vaccination of individuals at risk for vaccine-preventable STIs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals with STIs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective diagnosis, treatment, counseling, and follow-up of infected individuals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation, treatment, and counseling of sex partners of infected individuals</p><p/><p>This topic addresses STI risk assessment, counseling, vaccination, and antimicrobial-based preventive strategies. </p><p>Screening for STIs is discussed elsewhere.

Assessment of any history of substance use, which can lead to disinhibition and risk-taking behaviors, is also important. The &quot;Five Ps&quot; approach is one risk assessment strategy suggested by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61677 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Adults should be considered at increased STI risk if they have a current or past history of an STI or a history of multiple sex partners. In areas of high STI prevalence, all sexually active patients in nonmonogamous relationships can be considered at increased risk. Other risk factors are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1174843170\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to specific behavioral risk factors, demographic factors that are associated with high prevalence of STIs inform the approach to screening and prevention. Adolescents are one such demographic group among whom screening is recommended regardless of individual risk factors.

Adolescents should be routinely asked about sexual activity, and sexually active adolescents should be screened for STIs and counseled on risk reduction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections#H602294876\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;, section on 'Screening recommendations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents#H2697270756\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexually transmitted infections: Issues specific to adolescents&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for STIs'</a>.)</p><p>In the United States, approximately one half of the estimated 19 million incident STIs each year occur in young people aged 15 to 24 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The CDC created a national surveillance system to monitor behaviors that may increase STI risk among adolescents. In 2015, an estimated 41 percent of high school students had any history of sexual intercourse (down from 54 percent in 1991), and 12 percent reported four or more lifetime sexual partners (down from 19 percent in 1991) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The proportion of sexually active students reporting condom use decreased from 63 to 57 percent between 2003 and 2015 after having increased from 46 percent in 1991 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Despite the prevalence of STIs and sexual risk behavior among adolescents, providers frequently fail to inquire about sexual behavior or counsel about risk reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1778827202\"><span class=\"h3\">Men who have sex with men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for HIV infection and other viral and bacterial STIs, in part because of individual behavioral risk but also because of other factors, such as a higher prevalence of these infections within MSM sexual networks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Clinicians should assess sexual risk for all male patients through careful sexual history-taking and counseling on risk reduction at regular clinic visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Clinicians should also routinely ask patients about symptoms consistent with common STIs, including urethral discharge, dysuria, ulcers, or anorectal symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections#H602295897\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;, section on 'Assessing risk'</a>.)</p><p>Increased rates of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydial infections, mostly in HIV-infected MSM, have been reported in many cities in the United States and Europe. MSM also have a higher than typical risk of sexual exposure to viral hepatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H947750714\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In particular, those receiving pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV are at high risk for other STIs. As an example, in a study of over 650 individuals initiating PrEP in San Francisco, California, no new HIV infections were identified, but over 40 percent reduced the use of condoms, and 50 percent had an incident STI within 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, routine screening for bacterial STIs is an important element of care for patients using PrEP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection#H2253842332\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Administration of pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV infection&quot;, section on 'Routine monitoring and counseling'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease have been detected among MSM in several cities in the United States and Europe. Although not an STI per se, <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> can be transmitted through close contact, including kissing and sexual contact. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection#H3345873843\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Neisseria meningitidis infection&quot;, section on 'Serogroup C in men who have sex with men'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3336088751\"><span class=\"h3\">Transgender men and women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transgender individuals identify with a gender that differs from their sex at birth. Gender identity is distinct from sexual orientation, and risk factors for STIs vary widely in this heterogeneous population. Overall, transgender individuals have a higher prevalence of sexually transmitted and nonsexually transmitted HIV infection and STIs than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Individual risk of STIs depends on the current anatomy and sexual behavior, and STI screening and counseling should be tailored to the individual's anatomy and risk behavior. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections#H298794690\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;, section on 'Transgender individuals'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3280264\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High rates of STIs have been identified through screening programs among HIV-infected patients worldwide. Routine STI screening and counseling of HIV-infected patients in order to reduce the spread of STIs is warranted, particularly because some STIs, in turn, can increase HIV transmission. Patients with repeated STIs warrant enhanced behavioral counseling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections#H298797772\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;, section on 'HIV-infected patients'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3077297818\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnant women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the potential for high morbidity among pregnant women with STIs and poor fetal outcomes following maternal infection, all pregnant women should be screened for STIs at the first prenatal visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Women at higher risk (eg, those diagnosed with an STI during pregnancy, those with ongoing or new risk factors, and those living in communities with high syphilis prevalence) should be screened more often during pregnancy.

However, counseling efficacy may depend on how it is performed. (See <a href=\"#H620272440\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>Based on the available evidence, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends high-intensity behavioral counseling to prevent STIs for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk for STIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This type of counseling is characterized by multiple sessions over a short period and often in a peer-group setting. It can be resource intensive. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also emphasize the importance of prevention counseling for risk reduction for all sexually active adolescents and for all adults who have received an STI diagnosis, have had an STI in the past year, or have multiple partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Given the lack of continuity of care in the STI clinical environment, CDC recommendations emphasize the possible utility of brief single-session counseling sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In such settings, other low-intensity interventions, such as waiting room instructional videos, can also be useful counseling strategies. (See <a href=\"#H2184396102\" class=\"local\">'Individualized counseling'</a> below and <a href=\"#H620272440\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>Resources and training documents on behavioral intervention strategies can be found at the <a href=\"https://effectiveinterventions.cdc.gov/&amp;token=yJUP0KU9ocOeyw5zs9EGhEo8QvVk7RZglssZVILQZgowzNDurgbgDNdsopo3Xnz5&amp;TOPIC_ID=7595\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC Effective Interventions website</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2184396102\"><span class=\"h2\">Individualized counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient-centered STI and HIV prevention counseling involves tailoring a discussion of risk reduction to the individual situation and can be performed during a single brief clinic session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. One useful framework for patient-centered counseling is the &quot;Ask, Screen, Intervene&quot; curriculum, developed by the National Network of <span class=\"nowrap\">STD/HIV</span> Prevention Training Center in partnership with the AIDS Education and Training Centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-psychotherapies#H432862274\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of psychotherapies&quot;, section on 'Motivational interviewing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Motivational interviewing for substance use disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Specific high-risk sexual practices that are important to highlight include condomless anal intercourse, multiple sex partners, and concomitant use of alcohol or illicit drugs, which can lead to disinhibition and risky behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Counseling should also encourage abstinence from sexual intercourse until the course of antibiotics for a specific STI has been completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Women also need to be counseled that contraceptive methods that are not mechanical barriers offer no protection against HIV or other STIs. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Male condom use'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620272440\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a systematic review of trials evaluating the efficacy of a variety of behavioral interventions, most trials suggested a modest reduction in bacterial STIs among high-risk adults receiving high-intensity counseling programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Similar findings were observed for sexually active adolescents. Of note, there are limited data among pregnant women and nonsexually active individuals. In one large randomized controlled study among STI clinic patients (Project RESPECT), those who received patient-centered counseling had fewer subsequent bacterial STIs (trichomoniasis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis) compared with those who received standard educational messages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although this result was not replicated in a study conducted 10 years later in a similar setting (Project AWARE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], expert groups continue to emphasize the value of patient-centered counseling. (See <a href=\"#H2184396102\" class=\"local\">'Individualized counseling'</a> above.)</p><p>Certain low-intensity behavioral interventions can also be effective, especially if large groups of high-risk persons can be exposed. As an example, a controlled study following over 40,000 patients in three United States STI clinics demonstrated an almost 10 percent reduction in incident STIs among those exposed to a waiting room condom promotion video (&quot;Safe in the City&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">VACCINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccinations are available for the prevention of several infections that are sexually transmitted or associated with sexual activity; these include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (HPV), and <em>N. meningitidis</em>. </p><p>Individuals with advanced immunodeficiency may have an impaired response to vaccination, and multiple doses may be required to achieve an adequate antibody response.

In 2006, hepatitis A vaccination was incorporated into the routine childhood vaccination schedule in the United States. Two doses administered at least six months apart are recommended. Post-vaccination serologic testing is not recommended in immunocompetent individuals because most persons respond to the vaccine.

Since sexual transmission of hepatitis A probably occurs because of fecal-oral contact, common barrier measures, such as condoms, are ineffective in preventing acquisition of this disease. The effectiveness of dental dams during oral sex to prevent hepatitis A transmission is not known.

The amount of protection provided by condom use for the prevention of HIV and other STIs is difficult to establish given the ethical limitations of conducting randomized controlled trials.

Polyurethane male condoms likely provide similar protection. Condoms made of other synthetic material and natural membrane condoms should not be used for STI prevention. </p><p>Latex condoms should not be used five years after the manufacturing date or past the expiration date. A new condom should be used for each sex act, and it should be handled carefully to avoid tears or damage. The condom should be placed on after the penis is erect and prior to genital, oral, or anal contact with the partner. </p><p>Adequate lubrication with vaginal and anal sex should be ensured, but if exogenous lubrication is needed, only water-based lubricants should be used with latex condoms since oil-based lubricants (petroleum jelly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a>) can weaken latex. Either water- or oil-based lubricants can be used with polyurethane condoms. </p><p>To prevent slippage, the penis should be withdrawn while erect and the condom should be held firmly against the base of the penis during withdrawal. </p><p>Condoms are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, each latex condom manufactured is tested electronically for holes before packaging.

Assessment of condom use is generally by self-report, which may be unreliable. Incorrect use of condoms that would reduce their efficacy is rarely evaluated, and frequency of condom use is usually recorded as a static measure, when it may change over time. Each of these factors would underestimate the efficacy of appropriate condom use. </p><p>Nevertheless, in 2000, an expert panel convened by the National Institutes of Health performed a critical review of available scientific literature on the efficacy of condoms and concluded that condom use prevented HIV transmission in both men and women during vaginal intercourse and prevented gonorrhea in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Data on gonorrhea suggest an average transmission of one infection for every two exposures. Gonorrhea and chlamydia are more efficiently transmitted from males to females; male to female transmission of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> is approximately fourfold more efficient than female to male. A systematic review of studies published from 1966 to 2004 evaluated the effectiveness of condom use in preventing gonorrhea and chlamydia; most studies reviewed demonstrated a reduced risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].
