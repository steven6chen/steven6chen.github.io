In most patients, this disorder is associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.</p><p>A more accurate term for this type of vasculitis is the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome, which refers to primary or idiopathic cryoglobulinemia as well as cryoglobulinemia associated with autoimmune diseases, malignancy, or infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome can be caused by either type II or type III cryoglobulins, the characteristics of which are defined in the next section.

The biochemical characteristics that promote cryoprecipitation are not well understood. Cryoglobulins that contain more than one immunoglobulin component are called <strong>mixed</strong> cryoglobulins.</p><p>Three different immunochemical types of cryoglobulins have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cryoglobulins and cryoglobulinemia&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I cryoglobulinemia, in which the only immunoglobulin component of the cryoglobulin is a monoclonal immunoglobulin, is most often due to underlying multiple myeloma or Waldenstr&ouml;m's macroglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Type I cryoglobulins are usually IgM or IgG, but IgA and serum monoclonal free light chain cryoglobulins have been reported. Patients with type I cryoglobulins are usually asymptomatic, but the cryoglobulins may precipitate at room temperature which can produce symptoms similar to those of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

This disorder is often seen in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome), lymphoproliferative malignancies, and, in as many as one-half of cases, HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p/><p>The relative frequency of the three types of cryoglobulins was evaluated in a multicenter study in which immunochemical classification was performed in 694 patients with cryoglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Although hepatomegaly and chronic liver disease are common in these patients, some do not have elevated serum aminotransferase levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, there may be little or no clinical evidence of active hepatitis at the time of presentation.</p><p>A separate issue is that most HCV-infected patients who have circulating cryoglobulins do <strong>not</strong> develop vasculitis. This was illustrated in a study of 226 patients with chronic liver disease, 127 of whom had HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Type II cryoglobulins were present in 22 (17 percent) and type III cryoglobulins were present in 47 (37 percent).

Similarly, HCV infection should be sought in all patients with a diagnosis of mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H160897078\" class=\"local\">'Role of HCV infection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H64200389\" class=\"local\">'Testing for cryoglobulins'</a> below.)</p><p>In some parts of northern Europe, such as the Netherlands, there is a very low prevalence of HCV infection and HCV is not found in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">HBV and other causes of chronic liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the series of 226 patients with chronic liver disease, which included the 127 patients described in the preceding section, chronic HBV infection was present in 40 patients; circulating cryoglobulins were present in 15 percent (compared with 4 percent in controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. HBV-associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis has been described in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The remaining 59 patients had other hepatic diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Circulating cryoglobulins were present in 19 of these patients (32 percent). The prevalence of cryoglobulinemia was higher in patients with increasing duration of disease and the presence of cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some cases of mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome are due to HIV infection. This relationship was illustrated in a consecutive, unselected series of 89 HIV-1-infected patients from Greece in whom mixed cryoglobulinemia was detected in 24 (27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Antibodies to HIV-1 were detected in all of the cryoprecipitates, and HIV-1 RNA sequences were detected in all but one of the cryoprecipitates. Nine of these patients had symptoms compatible with mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (eg, palpable purpura, arthralgias, and mononeuritis multiplex). Only 6 of the 24 patients with circulating cryoglobulins were infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and only three of these patients had HCV RNA sequences in the cryoprecipitate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome is mediated by the deposition of antigen-antibody complexes in capillaries and small arterioles, and occasionally also in small arteries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In skin biopsies, the hallmark of mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome is small vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The inflammation leads to destruction of the vessel wall with evidence of polymorphonuclear leukocyte nuclear debris (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78697\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78697 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-cutaneous-lesions-of-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The vasculitis is associated with deposition of immunoglobulins and complement in the vessel wall, and occasionally with precipitated cryoproteins within the vessel lumen. Thus, small vessel immune complex vasculitis plays the major role, and localized hyperviscosity due to cryoprecipitation of the proteins within the lumen may contribute. Serum levels of complement C4 are typically (but not always) low when patients have symptomatic mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome, reflecting complement consumption via the classical, immune complexed-mediated activation of the complement cascade.</p><p>The pathologic findings in patients with renal disease are presented below. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Renal disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H160897078\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of HCV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the immune complex consists of HCV, anti-HCV IgG, and IgM anti-IgG (rheumatoid factor). It is unclear why cryoglobulins are produced and why some antigens trigger this process. The HCV virion may serve as the inciting agent since it has been found in high concentrations in the cryoprecipitate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>].</p><p>In addition to increased production, decreased clearance of circulating immune complexes due to hepatic dysfunction may promote cryoglobulin accumulation in the circulation and subsequent tissue deposition. This is suggested by the association between circulating cryoglobulins and prolonged liver disease and cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'HCV infection'</a> above.)</p><p>Another possible causal link between chronic HCV infection and mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome is the finding that chronic HCV infection is associated with the presence of rheumatoid factor, and HCV-infected lymphocytes occasionally secrete immunoglobulins with rheumatoid factor activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The monoclonal rheumatoid factors associated with HCV-related cryoglobulinemia are encoded by a limited set of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes, which are sometimes also seen in patients with HCV infection who do not have cryoglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H270270944\"><span class=\"h2\">Major manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major clinical manifestations of mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome include palpable purpura (which is a major finding suggesting some form of small vessel vasculitis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78697\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78697 \">picture 1</a>), renal disease, arthralgias or arthritis, nonspecific systemic symptoms including weakness, peripheral neuropathy, and hypocomplementemia (with the fall in C4 levels often being most prominent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia/abstract/2,3,7-9,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,7-9,18-20</a>].

Positive serologic testing for hepatitis C virus supports the diagnosis of HCV-related cryoglobulinemia.

Summarized briefly, 10 to 20 mL of blood are drawn into syringes or collection tubes that have been <strong>prewarmed to 37&ordm;C without anticoagulants</strong> since anticoagulants can produce false positive results due to cryofibrinogen or heparin-precipitable complexes. False negative results can be seen if this protocol is not followed. In cases in which cryoglobulinemia is suspected but initial results are negative consideration should be given to drawing a new specimen which is kept warm and handled by the clinical laboratory to prevent cryoprecipitation.
