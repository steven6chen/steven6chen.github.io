Quadriplegia is the term doctors use when people can't move their arms or legs.</p><p>The most common cause of paraplegia and quadriplegia is an injury to the spinal cord. The spinal cord is the bundle of nerves that runs down a person's back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56246 \">figure 1</a>). Certain nerve disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, can also cause paraplegia and quadriplegia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15744910\"><span class=\"h1\">What other symptoms can people with paraplegia or quadriplegia have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Besides being unable to move part of their body, people might also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No feeling in the arms or legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No control over their bladder or bowels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing &ndash; This can happen only with quadriplegia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex problems, including trouble getting an erection or ejaculating</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15744925\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. People with paraplegia or quadriplegia have tests to see what's causing their condition and how serious their condition is. Different tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-rays</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests, such as a CT or MRI scan &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve tests to check whether the nerves are working normally</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15744940\"><span class=\"h1\">How are paraplegia and quadriplegia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for paraplegia and quadriplegia involves treatment right after the spinal cord injury plus long-term treatment.</p><p>Right after a spinal cord injury, people are treated in the hospital. There, the doctor can monitor them and treat the medical problems that happen. For instance, people who are having a very hard time breathing usually need a breathing tube. A breathing tube is a tube that goes down the throat and into the lungs. The other end is attached to a machine that helps with breathing.</p><p>Some people with a spinal cord injury are treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called steroids &ndash; These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. These steroids help reduce swelling in the spinal cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to fix the back bones (vertebrae), if they got pushed out of position</p><p/><p>Long-term treatment involves different parts. The main part is called &quot;rehabilitation,&quot; or &quot;rehab&quot; for short. Rehabilitation is the care people get after an injury. In rehabilitation, doctors, nurses, and other health professionals will teach you how to be as independent as possible and stay as healthy as possible. This includes learning how to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a wheelchair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manage your bladder and bowel, if you have no control over your bladder or bowel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise, so that you can regain as much movement in your arms or legs as possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cope with feelings of sadness or anger</p><p/><p>Another big part of long-term treatment is helping prevent problems that commonly happen in people with paraplegia or quadriplegia. These problems can happen when people sit or lie in the same position for a very long time. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract infections and kidney problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure sores, which are areas of damage to the skin and tissue under the skin caused by pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung infections and breathing problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoporosis, which is a disease that makes your bones weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle and joint stiffness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p/><p>Your doctor or nurse will show you ways to prevent and manage these problems. This might include changing your body position often or sleeping on a special type of mattress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15744955\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like with paraplegia or quadriplegia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with paraplegia or quadriplegia lead a full life. Many people are able to work, drive, have serious relationships, and have children. Some people even regain some movement or feeling in their arms or legs.</p><p>Many people with paraplegia or quadriplegia worry about whether they will be able to have sex. Problems with sex are common, but there are medicines and devices that can often help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15744970\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neck fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-sclerosis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Multiple sclerosis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pressure-sores-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pressure sores (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Depression (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in men (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-directives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Advance directives (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=going-home-from-the-hospital-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Going home from the hospital (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-men-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in men (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in women (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
