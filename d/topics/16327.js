When it occurs, it is often associated with asthma. Like spontaneous pneumothorax, SPM mainly affects adolescent males with a tall, thin body habitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis, evaluation, and treatment of isolated SPM in children will be reviewed here. SPM associated with pneumothorax has a distinct pathogenesis and its management is similar to that of the pneumothorax itself. Pneumomediastinum associated with trauma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous pneumothorax in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intrathoracic injuries in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumomediastinum is defined as the presence of air or other gas in the mediastinum, and is also known as mediastinal emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Pneumomediastinum can be categorized as spontaneous (SPM) or traumatic. Traumatic pneumomediastinum is caused by blunt or penetrating trauma to the chest, or iatrogenic injury, such as that produced by thoracic surgery. Mechanical ventilation is a common cause of barotrauma and pneumomediastinum. Pneumomediastinum caused by mechanical ventilation is often considered a type of traumatic pneumomediastinum, rather than SPM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intrathoracic injuries in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Some authors distinguish between primary SPM (in which there is no underlying lung disease that would predispose the individual to air leak) and secondary SPM (in which there is an underlying airway disease, such as cystic fibrosis or asthma). The patient's prognosis and management is driven by the underlying lung disease, if any, rather than by the SPM itself.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SPM is uncommon in children. The reported incidence varies widely, ranging from 1 in 800 to 1 in 42,000 adult and pediatric patients admitted to a hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], and the rate of SPM among children presenting for emergency treatment of asthma is between 0.3 and 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The wide range of reported incidence rates is probably due to differences in the diagnostic methods used and also to the severity of symptoms in the population studied. Many more cases are detected if patients presenting with sudden chest pain or shortness of breath are routinely screened for SPM. As an example, in a study employing routine screening of young adults admitted for unexplained chest pain or dyspnea, the incidence of SPM was 1:368 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some studies suggest that SPM is often missed among children who present to an emergency department with chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>].</p><p>SPM is particularly common among newborns. In one institution, nine neonates were diagnosed with pneumomediastinum during a six-year period, leading to an estimated incidence of 1 per 1000; about one-third of these cases received respiratory support prior to diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-air-leak-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary air leak in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After the neonatal period, there is a second peak in incidence during late infancy and early childhood, probably due to the high prevalence of respiratory infections in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The association with respiratory infections could be mediated by increased pressure within obstructed airways, or by tissue necrosis from parenchymal infection. There is a third peak during adolescence. Tall, thin males are disproportionately affected, as is the case for spontaneous pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-3,6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,6,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SPM occurs when air leaks through small alveolar ruptures to the surrounding bronchovascular sheath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Less commonly, pneumomediastinum results from air escaping from the upper respiratory tract, intrathoracic airways, or gastrointestinal tract (eg, esophageal perforation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Because the mean pressure in the mediastinum is always more negative than the pressure in the pulmonary parenchyma, the free air tends to move centripetally along the vascular sheaths, perhaps facilitated by the pumping action of breathing. The air dissects to the hilum and spreads into the mediastinum or through the loose mediastinal fascia to the subcutaneous tissues of the thorax, upper limbs, and neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111129\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111129 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4172656294\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, the movement of air into the subcutaneous tissues prevents the buildup of pressure in the mediastinum. Occasionally, air leaks into the pericardial space causing pneumopericardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p>Very rarely, pressure accumulates in the mediastinal cavity causing pneumothorax or compression of adjacent intrathoracic structures (tension pneumomediastinum or tension pneumopericardium). These complications are probably triggered by an abrupt rise in mediastinal pressure. Less than twenty cases of tension pneumomediastinum have been reported, most of which were associated with massive pneumomediastinum in the setting of mechanical ventilation, with or without thoracic trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16-19</a>]. Tension pneumopericardium has been reported most commonly in newborn infants during mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-air-leak-in-the-newborn#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary air leak in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Pneumopericardium'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Predisposing conditions or triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A predisposing condition or trigger can be identified in most cases of SPM, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61465\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61465 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In most series, acute asthma exacerbations are the most common trigger (accounting for 20 to 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22</a>]), followed by lower respiratory tract infection (10 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22-24</a>]). Less common causes include Valsalva maneuver (often related to intense sport activities, coughing, or drug-induced exertion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], diabetic ketoacidosis, esophageal rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], choking or foreign body aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], inhalation of helium gas from party balloons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], measles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>], dental extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], and barotrauma (flying or scuba diving) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In some series, use of illicit inhalation drugs was a common trigger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common presenting symptoms of pneumomediastinum and their approximate frequencies were outlined in systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain (55 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea (40 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough (32 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck pain (17 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Odynophagia (14 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphagia (10 percent)</p><p/><p>The chest pain is typically retrosternal, pleuritic in nature (with exacerbation during deep inspiration), and may radiate to the neck, shoulders, and arms.

A history of drug use should be specifically sought, including both inhalational drugs (eg, cocaine), and hallucinogenic drugs (eg, ecstasy), which may cause extraordinary and sustained physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In young children, a history of choking raises the possibility of foreign body aspiration, even if the choking was transient.

When obtained, then acute phase reactants (such as blood neutrophil counts and serum C-reactive protein) may be moderately elevated in patients with SPM, but this is probably due to an underlying infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/46,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,58</a>].

When pneumothorax occurs in conjunction with SPM, it is usually from the same alveolar air leak. Rarely, this co-occurrence is due to a more serious process, such as esophageal perforation or tension pneumomediastinum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous pneumothorax in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3467829260\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous esophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome) is a cause of pneumomediastinum. The clinical features depend upon the location of the perforation (cervical, intrathoracic, or intra-abdominal), the degree of leakage, and the time elapsed since the injury occurred. Patients typically present with chest pain, subcutaneous emphysema, as do patients with SPM. However, patients with esophageal perforation are more likely to have hypotension and shock than those with SPM. The presence of a pleural effusion also suggests the possibility of esophageal perforation.</p><p>Esophageal perforation is rare in children but can occur after violent vomiting or as a complication of an esophageal foreign body. Pleural effusions may develop over hours or days after the injury. If esophageal perforation is suspected, the diagnosis can be confirmed by water-soluble contrast esophagram.

However, if such patients have underlying chronic lung or airway disease that predisposes to atelectasis, 100 percent oxygen therapy should be administered with caution because it may lead to absorptive atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are little data to support specific recommendations regarding air travel in an infant or child who has experienced a recent SPM. The interval after SPM when a child is at risk for recurrence during air travel has not been established, especially for children of different ages or for different underlying clinical conditions. The risk is uncertain, but is probably low once the air leak has resolved. Some clinicians permit air travel approximately two weeks after radiographic resolution of SPM, provided that any underlying disease, such as asthma, is well controlled.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SPM mainly affects children and young adults. Triggers for SPM include asthma, respiratory tract infections, vigorous vomiting or coughing, intense physical effort, or Valsalva maneuver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61465\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61465 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SPM typically presents with the sudden onset of retrosternal pleuritic chest pain, subcutaneous emphysema, and sometimes dyspnea. The heart exam may reveal a characteristic crunching sound that is synchronous with systole (Hamman's sign). The diagnosis is confirmed by plain films of the chest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60290\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60290 \">image 3</a>).

Complicated SPM is rare in the absence of trauma.

Asthma or other underlying lung disease is treated as indicated. Most patients recover without sequelae within a few days, and recurrence is rare.
