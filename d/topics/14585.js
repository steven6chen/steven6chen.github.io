Stress also affects patients' reactions to pregnancy loss during infertility treatment and pregnancy complications. Moreover, psychological distress is associated with infertility treatment failure, and interventions to relieve stress are associated with increased pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>In addition, preconception stress may increase the risk of infertility. In a 12-month, prospective observational study of women starting to attempt pregnancy naturally, salivary alpha-amylase (an index of stress) was measured at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, age of the woman, consuming alcohol, and smoking cigarettes), the baseline level of alpha-amylase predicted subsequent infertility, such that infertility was more than twice as likely to occur in women with the highest tertile levels of alpha-amylase, compared with women in the lowest tertile.</p><p>Many patients with infertility and psychological stress (eg, anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depressive symptoms) do not receive mental health services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H734917214\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE OF STRESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychological distress (eg, anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depressive symptoms) is common in couples with infertility, and appears to be more common in the partner with the fertility problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study followed women (n = 352) who presented for treatment at an infertility clinic for up to 18 months, along with their male partners (n = 274), using self-report instruments to assess clinically significant symptoms of anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The primary findings included the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anxiety was present at baseline in approximately 50 percent of the women and 33 percent of the men; at one or more assessments, anxiety was present in approximately 75 percent of the women and 60 percent of the men. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Depression was present at baseline in approximately 25 percent of the women and 10 percent of the men; at one or more assessments, depression was present in approximately 55 percent of the women and 33 percent of the men.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of women (n = 112) seeking treatment for infertility, structured interviews with a psychiatrist at baseline found that at least one psychiatric disorder was present in 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The most common were generalized anxiety disorder (23 percent), unipolar major depression (17 percent), and persistent depressive <span class=\"nowrap\">disorder/dysthymia</span> (10 percent). These figures suggest that psychiatric disorders are more prevalent among infertility patients than primary care patients and the general population.</p><p/><p>A prior history of depression is a risk factor for recurrence of symptoms during infertility evaluation and therapy, although the exact prevalence is not known. However, it is known that women with a prior history of depression are at increased risk of experiencing infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF STRESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stress is defined as a stimulus which produces mental tension or physiological reaction, for the purposes of this review, the experience of infertility is the stimulus. Distress is the experience of anxiety or suffering, for the purposes of this review, the experience of infertility leads to the suffering</p><p>Investigators have routinely utilized self-report questionnaires to evaluate the stress level of infertility patients. This approach may under-report the true level of distress since patients may feign emotional well-being in order to appear psychologically appropriate for infertility treatment. In research studies, the gold standard in psychological assessment is a structured personal interview with a trained mental health professional (psychiatrist or psychologist).</p><p>Clinically, the provider can assess stress by observation of the patient and inquiring about the patient's emotional state. Research shows that the main sources of stress for infertility patients are the impact of infertility on their social life, their sexual health, and their relationships with their partner. Thus, questions which ask about each of these areas are recommended. These could include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you feel uncomfortable being around pregnant women <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> children or babies?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you find that you try to avoid situations where there may be pregnant women or <span class=\"nowrap\">babies/small</span> children?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is your sexual relationship very satisfying, satisfying, or dissatisfying? And if it is dissatisfying, do you feel that your infertility has had a negative impact on your sex life?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you only make love during the fertile times of your cycle?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you feel that you and your partner mostly agree about how to proceed with infertility treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you feel that your partner is sympathetic and supportive of you?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How is your mood? How have you been feeling? Are you able to enjoy your usual activities?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are you worried? Do you have difficulty concentrating or sleeping? Are you restless?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has your appetite changed?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">IN VITRO FERTILIZATION PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The level of stress in infertility patients tends to increase as treatment intensifies and as duration of treatment continues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Therefore, in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients would be expected to experience more stress than women early in their infertility evaluation. </p><p>In addition, medications that are used to treat infertility may contribute to depressive symptoms. In a study of women taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> (n = 15), clinically significant depression occurred in 60 percent (n = 9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and an observational study of women taking gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist medication (n = 16) found that depressive symptoms occurred in 75 percent (n = 12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Many IVF patients report depressive symptoms prior to beginning their cycle, which likely reflects the impact of repeated, unsuccessful, less invasive forms of treatment, but may reflect a prior history of <span class=\"nowrap\">mood/anxiety</span> disorders independent of infertility. As an example, one study showed that 54 percent of patients reported mild depressive symptoms prior to initiating an IVF cycle and 19 percent had moderate to severe levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Since IVF is highly invasive and intensive, patient distress is not unanticipated. In fact, most IVF patients state that treatment is more of a psychological than a physical stressor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Nearly half of female IVF patients reported that infertility was the most upsetting experience of their lives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Several psychosocial factors are associated with the emotional adjustment of IVF patients. A review of 23 observational studies found that across multiple studies, neuroticism (negative emotional states such as anxiety and depression), and escapist coping strategies (avoidance or distraction) were each risk factors for distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. By contrast, social support was associated with decreased distress.</p><p>Most IVF patients report symptoms of depression, anxiety, anger, and isolation after unsuccessful treatment. Many of these symptoms persist over extended periods of time. In one retrospective study of 86 couples who did not conceive with IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], 66 percent of women and 40 percent of men reported symptoms of depression following their failed IVF treatment and one third of the respondents reported depressive symptoms 18 months later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of stress on drop out</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infertility specialists traditionally have assumed that patients drop out of treatment for only two reasons: active censoring (their physician advises the couple to terminate treatment due to a poor prognosis) and finances (the procedure is often not covered by insurance). However, this assumption has been challenged; the majority of insurance-covered patients voluntarily terminate treatment prior to completing their allotment of covered cycles and the psychological burden of the procedures appears to be a major reason for dropout.</p><p>Active censoring appears to be less common than previously thought. A study in the Netherlands, where IVF cycles are covered by insurance, showed a cumulative drop-out rate after three cycles of 62 percent, only 14 percent of which was due to active censoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Most patients gave up because of passive censoring, which the authors defined as giving up treatment because of natural conception or personal reasons.</p><p>Research also suggests that cost is frequently not the motive for dropping out:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 974 couples in Sweden, 65 percent did not complete the three IVF cycles which were covered under their health plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The authors speculated that the high attrition rate was due to the physical and emotional burdens associated with IVF, but did not specifically ask couples why they discontinued treatment. A similar study on Australian couples had comparable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Couples were offered up to six cycles free of charge but the mean number of started cycles was only 3.1, whether or not a live birth was achieved. The most common reasons for terminating treatment were emotional (66 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study contacted 211 couples who had insurance coverage for IVF, but dropped out for reasons other than active censoring, and asked them for the main reason for their decision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The most commonly cited reason was psychological burden, followed by the perception of poor prognosis. Patients who dropped out of treatment were as satisfied with their treatment as those who did not drop out. These findings were consistent with a similar study in which 515 patients who terminated treatment were contacted and asked to give the reason for their decision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Psychological stress was the most common reason cited, followed by lack of success.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impact of psychological stress on IVF outcome was also illustrated by a retrospective study of 2130 German patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Despite the fact that these patients were covered by insurance for four cycles, the drop-out rate of nonpregnant patients was 40 percent after the first cycle and 62 percent after the fourth. The author hypothesized that the increasing drop-out rate was attributable to the &quot;enormous stress and frustration&quot; during treatment (the patients themselves were not surveyed).</p><p/><p>A patient's psychological state may predict dropping out of in vitro fertilization. In a pooled analysis of 22 studies (n &gt;21,000 patients treated with in vitro fertilization), discontinuation of treatment due to psychological burden was observed in 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. As an example, one of the studies prospectively administered a battery of psychological questionnaires to new patients prior to starting treatment, and found that increased pretreatment levels of depression were associated with patient drop-out after only one cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Distress levels in female patients undergoing in vitro fertilization may be correlated with prematurely dropping out of treatment and with pregnancy rates. However, it is not definitive that treating distress can reduce premature discontinuation of in vitro fertilization or increase pregnancy rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of stress on IVF outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since IVF is by far the most expensive and invasive form of infertility treatment, it is important to understand the impact of psychological distress on its outcome. It is concerning that the majority of patients report symptoms of anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression prior to commencing IVF treatment. If psychological distress can interfere with the success of treatment, and most patients report elevated levels of distress, then the impact of distress may be important. Research on the impact of distress on IVF outcome is more generalizable than for other infertility treatments since the protocol for IVF is comparable internationally.</p><p>As discussed above, distress is one reason that couples drop out of IVF programs before achieving a pregnancy. In the previously described German study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], cumulative pregnancy rates if patients had not dropped out of treatment were estimated. The 2130 patients underwent a mean of only 1.92 cycles, even though the mean number of cycles to conception was 2.12; 49 percent underwent only one cycle. The real cumulative pregnancy rate was 31.4 percent after four cycles. Theoretically, if all nonpregnant patients had returned for only one more cycle, the cumulative pregnancy rate would have increased to 41 percent and if all non-pregnant patients had completed four cycles, the ongoing pregnancy rate would have been 53 percent, this would have increased to 60 percent after six cycles.</p><p>Psychological stress may adversely affect IVF outcome in ways other than raising the drop out rate. At least 25 studies have addressed the <span class=\"nowrap\">distress/IVF</span> relationship: 16 found a significant relationship between preprocedure distress and subsequent pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/12,16,25-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16,25-39</a>], three noticed a trend [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/38,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40,41</a>], four reported no relationship between distress and pregnancy outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/40,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42-44</a>], and one study did not supply adequate data to draw any conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The interpretation of some of this research is limited by methodological problems, including small sample sizes, measures of distress taken at different stages of treatment, use of different psychological questionnaires, and lack of adjustment for the potential impact of negative feedback. As an example, patients are aware of their ultrasound and laboratory results and understand when a good response has not been achieved. One would expect these patients to report higher levels of emotional distress, but, in the absence of baseline data, it can be difficult to determine whether the distress level led to poorer outcomes or whether patients who are experiencing a poor response to the medications (and thus have a poor prognosis) simply are reporting the resultant distress. However, many of the studies had solid research designs so that there are baseline data and the response to the medications is factored in.</p><p>The best data on this subject comes from a prospective study in which 151 women were assessed prior to beginning an IVF or GIFT cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. This was the first cycle for 66 percent of the sample. Participants completed a battery of psychological questionnaires at their first clinic visit and at the time of their procedure. Medical records were abstracted for information on the technical information about each cycle including the diagnosis, number of previous cycles, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rates, number of embryos transferred, embryo quality, presence or absence of a confirmed pregnancy, and pregnancy outcome.</p><p>Major findings from this study were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The baseline level of stress was significantly correlated with numerous biologic end points, including number of oocytes retrieved and fertilized, pregnancy, live birth rate, and birth weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stress level on the day of the procedure was significantly related only to the number of oocytes retrieved and fertilized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At baseline, the frequency of no live birth was 93 percent lower in women with the least distress compared to those with the most distress.</p><p/><p>The authors concluded that patients should receive counseling, support, and education to decrease stress levels during the baseline period.</p><p>A meta-analysis on this topic received widespread attention because it did not find a relationship between distress and conception in IVF patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, the authors included only 14 of the available studies; one of the largest studies included, which had negative results, has not yet been published. In addition, they prioritized &ldquo;state anxiety&rdquo; as their main measure of distress, despite the fact that patient distress was assessed up to three months prior to cycle start. &ldquo;State anxiety&rdquo; measures how anxious one is at that moment and thus is not an appropriate measure to be used far in advance of an event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>A subsequent study in this area highlights the complexity of the <span class=\"nowrap\">stress/IVF</span> outcome relationship. In this study, 148 women were followed prospectively through two IVF cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Half were randomized to attend a 10-session <span class=\"nowrap\">mind/body</span> program and the other half received usual care. All patients completed baseline psychological questionnaires prior to randomization and daily during their IVF cycles. Patients with moderate levels of distress at baseline were more likely to conceive than those with low levels at baseline. However, patients in the <span class=\"nowrap\">mind/body</span> intervention with moderate levels of distress at baseline were significantly more likely to conceive than control patients with moderate levels at baseline. It is possible that a moderate level of distress prior to cycle start is beneficial as long as patients have the opportunity to learn stress-reduction skills.</p><p>The relationship between stress and outcome may depend on at the point in time the distress is assessed. Stress prior to cycle start may be beneficial, but distress during treatment may be detrimental. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assessment of the efficacy of psychological interventions in both reducing distress and increasing pregnancy rates has been hampered by inadequate research. A review of 380 published and unpublished papers on psychological interventions for infertility patients had only 25 independent evaluation studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Results from these 25 studies suggested that psychosocial interventions could reduce negative affect and group interventions that emphasized education and skills training were highly effective in producing positive changes. However, this review did not find that psychosocial interventions impacted pregnancy rates. A subsequent review of this literature concluded that psychotherapy (either in a group or <span class=\"nowrap\">individual/couple</span> format) led to a reduction in anxiety and depression, as well as a possible increase in conception rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>A systematic review included a meta-analysis of six randomized trials (n &gt;800 infertile couples) that compared psychological interventions (eg, mindfulness or cognitive-behavioral therapy) with control conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Pregnancy occurred in more patients who received psychological interventions than controls (relative risk 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4). In addition, the review included a second meta-analysis (20 randomized trials, n &gt;2100 infertile couples) that examined symptoms such as distress, anxiety, and depression; improvement was greater in patients who received psychological interventions than controls, and the clinical effect was moderate to large. However, heterogeneity across studies in both meta-analyses was at least moderate. </p><p>One of the psychological approaches used to manage emotional distress in infertile couples is cognitive-behavioral therapy. Cognitive-behavioral approaches for infertility patients have been utilized since at least 1987 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. The content of these programs varies, but each generally contains relaxation techniques, stress-management, coping skills training, and group support. Programs range from 5 to 10 sessions, depending on the center, most include the male partners for at least several of the sessions, and are led by mental health clinicians, nurses, or both. Participants report decreases in all assessed psychological and physical symptoms, including depression, anxiety, hostility, fatigue, headaches, insomnia, and abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Approximately 45 percent of patients conceive within six months of program completion. &#160;</p><p>Other treatments for managing the psychological consequences of infertility include mindfulness based interventions. Information about mindfulness based cognitive therapy is discussed separately in the context of treating depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mindfulness based cognitive therapy as maintenance treatment for unipolar major depression&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Psychological interventions that are convenient and low cost may improve outcomes. As an example, a 12-month randomized trial compared a self-administered cognitive coping and relaxation intervention with routine care in patients (n = 161) beginning in vitro fertilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The active intervention consisted of an educational leaflet, relaxation techniques, and a set of 10 statements intended to facilitate coping by focusing upon positive thoughts and activities during stressful situations (eg, &ldquo;Try to do something that makes me feel good&rdquo;). Although pregnancy rates were comparable for the two groups, discontinuation of in vitro fertilization occurred in fewer patients who received the active intervention, compared with controls (5 versus 15 percent). In addition, improvement of psychological factors (eg, anxiety and quality of life) was greater with active treatment. &#160; </p><p>It is unclear why a psychological intervention might have a positive impact on pregnancy rates in infertile women. One possibility is that psychological stress affects biologic functions, such as immunology of the maternal-fetal interface (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunology of the maternal-fetal interface&quot;</a>). As an example, a randomized trial reported psychological distress and natural killer cell activity both decreased in 37 women who received a five-session <span class=\"nowrap\">mind/body</span> intervention while there was no change in those who received routine care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. During the one year follow-up period, conception occurred in more patients who received the intervention than controls (38 versus 14 percent).</p><p>Based on the data presented above, we and others feel the psychological status of infertility patients should be assessed, ideally through structured interviews with a mental health professional but at a minimum through the use of valid questionnaires, in order to relieve personal suffering and to possibly improve pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/1,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,49</a>]. Patients who express symptoms of anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression should be treated. We suggest relaxation techniques, stress-management, coping skills training, and group support as initial therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-psychotherapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of psychotherapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pharmacotherapy may be indicated in cases in which psychological treatment has not been effective and the symptoms of anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression are moderate to severe (eg, the patient reports suicidal thoughts or behavior). These patients should be referred for a psychopharmacologic evaluation since the half life of antidepressants differ, and many infertility patients will be able to taper off their medications once a pregnancy is established. Women with a history of treatment for depression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anxiety should be carefully evaluated prior to commencing infertility treatment. Many patients decide to discontinue their antidepressant medications prior to trying to conceive and their depressive symptoms may recur and complicate what is already a difficult situation. These patients need to be evaluated by a psychiatrist to receive recommendations on the risks and benefits of taking medications. However, the use of antidepressant medication in women who are infertile is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In addition, the clinician needs to be aware of situations that might make patients more prone to experiencing psychiatric symptoms, such as depression or anxiety. In general, patients at increased risk are women with a history of psychiatric illness, who have experienced pregnancy loss(es), with longer histories of infertility, and with definitive medical diagnoses for their infertility that might lead to poorer prognoses (eg, premature ovarian failure, severe endometriosis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-during-pregnancy-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression during pregnancy: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For infertility patients, we suggest an integrated approach to emotional health that focuses upon reducing the burden of treatment (ie, assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-stress-and-infertility/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].
