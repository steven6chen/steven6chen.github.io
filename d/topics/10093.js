Almost everyone gets back pain at some point. Low back pain can be scary. But it is almost never serious. It usually goes away on its own. The cases that require urgent care or surgery are rare.</p><p>See your doctor or nurse if you have back pain and you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recently had a fall or an injury to your back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have numbness or weakness in your legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have problems with bladder or bowel control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have unexplained weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever or feel sick in other ways</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take steroid medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">prednisone</a>, on a regular basis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have diabetes or a medical problem that weakens your immune system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a history of cancer or osteoporosis</p><p/><p>You should also see a doctor if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your back pain is so severe that you cannot perform simple tasks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your back pain does not start to improve within 3 to 4 weeks</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480076100\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the parts of the back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The back is made up of (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56246 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vertebrae</strong> &ndash; A stack of bones that sit on top of one another like a stack of coins. Each of these bones has a hole in the center. When stacked, the bones form a hollow tube that protects the spinal cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Discs</strong> &ndash; Rubbery discs sit in between each of the vertebrae to add cushion and allow movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spinal cord and nerves</strong> &ndash; The spinal cord is the highway of nerves that connects the brain to the rest of the body. It runs through the vertebrae within the spinal canal. Nerves branch from the spinal cord and pass in between the vertebrae. From there they connect to the arms, the legs, and the organs. (This is why problems in the back can cause leg pain or bladder or bowel problems.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscles, tendons, and ligaments</strong> &ndash; Together the muscles, tendons, and ligaments are called the &quot;soft tissues&quot; of the back. These soft tissues support the back and help hold it together.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480076107\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes low back pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, doctors and nurses do not know what causes low back pain. Pain can happen if you strain a muscle or hurt a tendon or ligament. But if that is the cause of your pain, doctors and nurses have no way of knowing it for sure. Pain can also happen if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damaged, bulging, or torn discs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis affecting the joints of the spine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bony growths on the vertebrae that crowd nearby nerves</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A vertebra out of place</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narrowing in the spinal canal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tumor or infection (but this is very rare)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480076114\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I get an imaging test, like an MRI?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people do <strong>not</strong> need an imaging test. Most cases of back pain go away within 4 to 6 weeks &ndash; or in even less time. Doctors and nurses usually do not order imaging tests before then unless there are signs of something unusual.</p><p>If your doctor or nurse does not order an imaging test, do not worry. He or she can still learn a lot about your pain just from looking you over and talking with you. Plus, treatment can start right away, even without an imaging test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480076121\"><span class=\"h1\">How can the doctor or nurse tell what is wrong just by talking to me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your symptoms tell your doctor or nurse a lot about the cause of your pain. If your pain spreads down the back of one thigh, for instance, that could be a sign that one of the nerves that go to your leg is being pinched by a bulging or torn disc. If, on the other hand, your pain goes all the way down both legs, that could be a sign that you have bony growths on your spine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480076128\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best thing you can do is to stay as active as possible &ndash; even if you are in pain. People with low back pain recover faster if they stay active. Walk as much as you can. If you stopped working because of your pain, try to get back to your normal routine soon. But do not overdo it.</p><p>When you start to feel better, ask your doctor or nurse about exercises that can help strengthen your back. These exercises can help you get better faster and might make it less likely that you will have pain again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480076135\"><span class=\"h1\">How is back pain treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small number of people end up needing surgery to treat back pain. But most people do well with simpler treatments, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; First, you can try pain medicines that you can get without a prescription. In many cases, doctors suggest trying an NSAID, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve) first. These work better than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (Tylenol) for back pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If non-prescription medicines do not help, doctors and nurses can prescribe stronger pain medicines. Sometimes, doctors suggest a medicine to relax the muscles (called a &quot;muscle relaxant&quot;). But keep in mind that muscle relaxants are not generally used in people older than 65. In older people, these medicines can cause side effects such as trouble urinating or confusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy to teach you special exercises and stretches</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal manipulation &ndash; This is when someone like a physical therapist or a chiropractor moves or &quot;adjusts&quot; the joints of your back</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acupuncture &ndash; This is when someone who knows traditional Chinese medicine inserts tiny needles into your body to block pain signals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massage</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reducing stress &ndash; Some people feel better if they try something called &quot;mindfulness-based stress reduction.&quot; This involves going to a group program to practice relaxation, meditation, and yoga.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injections of medicines that numb the back or reduce swelling</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480076142\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to keep from getting back pain again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stay active and learn exercises that help strengthen and stretch your back. Learn to lift using your legs instead of your back. And avoid sitting or standing in the same position for too long.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480076149\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=herniated-disc-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Herniated disc (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-stenosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Spinal stenosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=do-i-need-an-x-ray-or-other-test-for-low-back-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Do I need an X-ray (or other test) for low back pain?
