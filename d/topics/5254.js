Factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of neutropenic fever include the direct effects of chemotherapy on mucosal barriers and immune deficits related to the underlying malignancy or other immunosuppressive conditions or therapies. Prior to the era of empiric antibiotic therapy, infections accounted for most episodes of neutropenic fever and approximately 70 percent of the mortality in neutropenic acute leukemia patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Because of the routine use of prompt empiric antibiotics, infections are documented less frequently today.</p><p>Although the majority of patients with neutropenic fever do not have a documented infection, consensus guidelines recommend that all cancer patients with neutropenic fever be promptly evaluated and treated with empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This approach is indicated since it is difficult to distinguish life-threatening infections from less serious infections in this patient population, and infection may progress rapidly in such patients. Furthermore, better outcomes are seen with prompt therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of cancer patients presenting with neutropenic fever will be reviewed here. An overview of neutropenic fever syndromes as well as the risk assessment and management of patients with neutropenic fever are presented separately.

The risk of clinically important infection rises as the neutrophil count falls below 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and is higher in those with a prolonged duration of neutropenia (&gt;7 days). For the purposes of this discussion, <strong>we are defining neutropenia as an ANC &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>.</strong></p><p>The ANC can be calculated by multiplying the total white blood cell (WBC) count by the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and bands (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-absolute-neutrophil-count\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). </p><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes#H981551211\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neutropenic fever syndromes&quot;, section on 'Neutropenia'</a>.)</p><p>Assessment of the risk of neutropenia before the WBC and differential results are available is discussed separately.

Most documented infections during neutropenia are due to bacteria. Although gram-negative organisms predominated a few decades ago, most documented infections are now due to gram-positive organisms. Factors contributing to this trend include use of long-term central venous catheters and empiric and prophylactic antimicrobials that are primarily active against gram-negative pathogens. Fungi and viruses can also be pathogens, particularly in high-risk patients.

(See <a href=\"#H222193074\" class=\"local\">'Initiation of empiric therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>All patients should undergo a careful history and detailed physical examination, as well as laboratory, microbiology, and imaging studies; the approach to the diagnostic evaluation is summarized in the following Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50509 \">table 1</a>). Because symptoms and signs of infection are attenuated due to the lack of an inflammatory reaction, fever may be the sole sign of infection. Thus, it is important to recognize that the absence of the typical symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings suggestive of infection typically seen in nonneutropenic patients cannot be used to exclude the possibility of infection. The evaluation should be performed promptly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29410394\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should probe for the development of new symptoms that can lead to identification of a site of infection. The initial clinical evaluation also focuses on assessing the risk of serious complications. (See <a href=\"#H222192868\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>The following key elements of the history should always be included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inquire about organ-specific symptoms.

This group of patients has been well studied in randomized trials and has been shown to be at low risk for serious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors are considered to be low risk for complications requiring hospitalization or prolonging hospitalization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We define high-risk patients as those who are expected to be neutropenic (ANC &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> for &gt;7 days. Patients with neutropenic fever who have ongoing comorbidities or evidence of significant hepatic or renal dysfunction are also considered to be high risk, regardless of the duration of neutropenia. Other criteria that confer a high-risk status can be found in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67027\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67027 \">table 2</a>).<br/><br/>Some experts have defined high-risk patients as those expected to have profound neutropenia (ANC &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> for &gt;7 days based on experience that such patients are the most likely to have life-threatening complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. However, formal studies to clearly differentiate between patients with an ANC &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> are lacking. For the purposes of this discourse, we will combine these groups. Profound prolonged neutropenia (ie, ANC &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> expected to last &gt;7 days) is most likely to occur in the preengraftment phase of hematopoietic cell transplantation (particularly allogeneic) and in patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia.</p><p/><p>An alternative to using the clinical criteria described above is to use the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk index, which is a validated tool for measuring the risk for neutropenic fever-related medical complications (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-multinational-association-for-supportive-care-in-cancer-mascc-risk-index-for-patients-with-neutropenic-fever-not-appropriate-for-children-less-than16-years-of-age\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The risk assessment of patients with neutropenic fever is discussed in greater detail separately.

The emphasis should be on sites most likely to be infected, including the skin, catheter sites, biopsy and bone marrow aspirate sites, teeth, oropharynx and gingival surfaces, sinuses, lungs, abdomen, genitals, and perianal area. As noted above, it is important to remember that in the absence of neutrophils, signs of inflammation can be extremely subtle.</p><p>Review of systems and a physical examination should be repeated daily. In patients with persistent fever, new sites of infection (eg, lungs, skin, and urinary tract) may become apparent over time. In addition, as the neutrophil count recovers, localizing symptoms and signs of infection often become evident for the first time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H588437531\"><span class=\"h3\">Lungs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lungs are a common site of infection in patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and should be examined for signs of pneumonia (eg, rales). Hypoxia, tachypnea, and increased work of breathing are other signs of pneumonia.

Fluctuance or exudates are unlikely since the lack of inflammatory cells inhibits the development of inflammatory reactions. IV catheters should also be assessed for any malfunction; difficulty with infusion or blood drawing can also be a sign of an infected venous thrombosis, even in the absence of a problem with the exit site. Sites of recent IV catheters should also be examined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H588437504\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin and mucous membranes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The skin and mucous membranes should be examined for signs of erythema, rash, cellulitis, ulcers, furuncles, vesicles, paronychia, mucositis, dental or peritonsillar cellulitis, perianal fissures, and pilonidal disease. Skin lesions can often be a manifestation of a systemic infection including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcers &ndash; Fungi, atypical bacteria, nontuberculous mycobacteria, viruses</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vesicles &ndash; Viruses</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nodules &ndash; Fungi, bacteria, nontuberculous mycobacteria</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ecthyma gangrenosum &ndash; Large lesion with a necrotic center that is classically seen with <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> but also with other bacteria, such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80582\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80582 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin lesions with a necrotic center &ndash; Invasive fungal infections (eg, <em>Fusarium</em> spp, <em>Aspergillus</em> spp, Mucorales) can also cause skin lesions with a necrotic center (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57016\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57016 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64575\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64575 \">picture 3</a>)</p><p/><p>Sometimes, skin lesions, such as erythema multiforme, can be related to viral infections; alternatively, erythema multiforme can be related to antibiotic therapy and may be associated with fever, causing diagnostic confusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74095\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74095 \">picture 4</a>).

Erythema, pain on palpation, and tender hemorrhoids are important signs of infection. However, digital rectal examination (and rectal temperatures) should be avoided so that one does not introduce infection by traumatizing the fragile mucosa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24668186\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood cell count with differential, hepatic transaminases, bilirubin, electrolytes, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urinalysis, and cultures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50509 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In interpreting laboratory results in neutropenic patients, it is important to recognize that the absence of the typical laboratory findings suggestive of infection that are usually seen in nonneutropenic patients cannot be used to exclude the possibility of infection. Therefore, absence of abnormalities, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, pyuria, or neutrophils on sputum Gram stain, does not rule out infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24668193\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum fungal markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Checking fungal markers from the serum, such as the <em>Aspergillus</em> galactomannan antigen and the beta-D-glucan assay, should also be considered in high-risk patients. Some centers perform serial monitoring of these twice weekly in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients and acute leukemia patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The <em>Aspergillus</em> galactomannan antigen is a specific test for invasive aspergillosis, whereas the beta-D-glucan assay is a nonspecific test for several invasive fungal infections, including aspergillosis and candidiasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis#H1064486430\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis&quot;, section on 'Galactomannan antigen detection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-invasive-aspergillosis#H1064486465\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis&quot;, section on 'Beta-D-glucan assay'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29410416\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiology and other diagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In all cancer patients presenting with neutropenic fever, empiric antibacterial therapy should be initiated immediately after blood cultures have been obtained and before any other investigations have been completed. The microbiologic evaluation should be performed promptly. (See <a href=\"#H222193074\" class=\"local\">'Initiation of empiric therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Specimens for the microbiology laboratory should include at least two sets of blood cultures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50509 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Each set should have a volume of 20 mL (proportionally smaller volume in children weighing &lt;40 kg; eg, no more than 1 percent of estimated patient total blood volume). In patients with a CVC, we prefer to collect a set of blood cultures simultaneously from each lumen and from a peripheral vein site. Some experts feel that it is acceptable to collect both sets of cultures from the CVC, especially in patients with difficult peripheral venous access. In patients without a CVC, a set should be obtained from each of two separate venipuncture sites. The diagnosis of CVC infections is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Blood cultures'</a>.)</p><p>Two sets of blood cultures are typically repeated daily for persistent fevers or rigors at least during the first two days following initiation of empiric antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Institutions may have different guidelines for the frequency of obtaining blood cultures. As an example, some centers stop collecting blood cultures or reduce the frequency of collection after several days if the initial cultures are negative for patients with a stable fever pattern. If the cultures are positive, they should be repeated until they become negative to ensure response to therapy and intermittently thereafter.</p><p>Specimens should be obtained from other sites as clinically indicated (eg, sputum, urine, CVC exit site, CSF, skin, stool). Many neutropenic patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy are also thrombocytopenic; in such patients, platelet transfusions are often necessary in order to safely perform a lumbar puncture or other invasive procedures. In general, indications for collection of these additional samples are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stool &ndash; If diarrhea is present, send a <em>Clostridium difficile</em> toxin assay. There is limited utility in sending stool samples for culture or ova and parasites in hospitalized patients in the United States; these studies can be sent in patients with recent travel to or residence in areas that are endemic for enteric pathogens or if there is another reason to suspect an enteric pathogen.

(See <a href=\"#H222193074\" class=\"local\">'Initiation of empiric therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>In febrile neutropenic patients with respiratory signs or symptoms, we suggest that a chest radiograph be obtained in low-risk patients and a non-contrast intermediate or high-resolution chest CT be obtained in high-risk patients (see <a href=\"#H222192868\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment'</a> above). In contrast, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend a chest radiograph as part of the initial evaluation for neutropenic fever in patients with respiratory symptoms without distinction by risk status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is important to note, however, that chest radiograph findings are often minimal or absent, even in patients with pneumonia or pulmonary nodules. Intermediate or high-resolution chest CT is much more sensitive for detecting abnormalities in neutropenic patients.</p><p>In one study, high-resolution chest CT demonstrated pneumonia in more than one-half of persistently febrile neutropenic patients who had normal findings on routine chest radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It was estimated that high-resolution CT scanning resulted in the diagnosis being established five days earlier compared with the exclusive use of chest radiographs but did not improve clinical outcomes. Although CT scanning has not been shown to change clinical outcomes, one should have a low threshold for ordering a CT scan in both high- and low-risk neutropenic patients with pulmonary symptoms to help guide the selection and duration of treatment and to assess for radiographic evidence of invasive fungal disease. Repeat chest imaging should be obtained for increasing or persistent pulmonary symptoms and signs, including cough, shortness of breath, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Radiographic findings may become evident along with an increase in symptoms as the neutropenia begins to resolve.</p><p>CT scanning of other sites (head, sinuses, <span class=\"nowrap\">abdomen/pelvis)</span> should be performed according to suggestive symptoms or other risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-cancer-patient-with-neutropenic-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In particular, patients with neutropenic fever and any signs or symptoms suggestive of neutropenic enterocolitis or <em>C. difficile</em> colitis (eg, abdominal pain or tenderness, diarrhea) should undergo abdominal CT scanning with IV and oral contrast.

Therefore, the evaluation of such patients should occur promptly and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given as soon as possible and at full doses (adjusted for renal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatic function).
