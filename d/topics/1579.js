Most cases respond to antiinflammatory or immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The main circulating autoantibodies, although not specific for the disease, are antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) in type 1 disease and, in type 2 autoimmune hepatitis, anti-liver-kidney microsome-1 antibodies (ALKM-1) and anti-liver cytosol antibody-1 (ALC-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The autoantibodies are not believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis and are not predictive of histologic severity or treatment response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Their main role is to identify patients with autoimmune hepatitis, and thereby point the way toward appropriate therapy and form the basis for a classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65135\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65135 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-disease-classification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Disease classification&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other circulating autoantibodies in autoimmune hepatitis can also provide help in diagnosing patients without classical autoantibodies, who previously may have been diagnosed as &quot;autoantibody-negative autoimmune hepatitis&quot; or cryptogenic chronic hepatitis. As an example, the presence of autoimmune hepatitis is suggested in a patient with chronic hepatitis who, in the absence of serologic markers of viral hepatitis, has anti-soluble <span class=\"nowrap\">liver/liver</span> pancreas antigen <span class=\"nowrap\">(anti-SLA/LP)</span> or atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (atypical pANCA), also referred to as &quot;anti-neutrophil nuclear antibody&quot; (pANNA). </p><p>Patients may present with autoimmune hepatitis without circulating autoantibodies, referred to as &quot;autoantibody-negative autoimmune hepatitis.&quot; Although infrequent, their course and response to treatment appear to be identical to autoantibody-positive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Most of the data on autoantibodies are based upon results obtained by immunofluorescence. By contrast, commercial laboratories tend to measure autoantibodies by ELISA, and thus it is possible that results may differ from those reported in the literature.</p><p>This topic will review the characteristics of the major autoantibodies that can occur in the two forms of autoimmune hepatitis and, when relevant, compare the findings in autoimmune hepatitis to the autoantibodies that can occur with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of autoimmune hepatitis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTINUCLEAR ANTIBODIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are serologic hallmarks for systemic or organ-specific autoimmune disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-and-clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement and clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies&quot;</a>). ANA are the most common circulating autoantibodies in autoimmune hepatitis. They are seen in adults and children with type 1 disease and rarely in type 2 disease. Titers considered positive are dependent in part upon the methodology used and the age of the patient. In most laboratories, titers in the range of 1:80 to 1:100 or greater are considered positive in adults. In children, titers of 1:20 or greater are considered positive. ANA may be the only autoantibodies present or may occur in conjunction with anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA). While ANA are commonly present in patients with autoimmune hepatitis, there are occasional patients whose only marker for autoimmune hepatitis is an elevated serum globulin level, so-called &quot;autoantibody negative autoimmune hepatitis&quot;.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunofluorescence patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Correlation of the patterns of ANA immunofluorescence with clinical characteristics, as has been done in rheumatic conditions, has been attempted in a group of patients with autoimmune hepatitis and ANA titers of 1:40 or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Using HEp-2 cell lines as a substrate, homogeneous patterns were found in 22 of 65 patients (34 percent) and a speckled pattern in 25 patients (38 percent). Centromeric, diffuse granular, nucleolar, mixed, and unclassified patterns accounted for the remainder. The immunofluorescence patterns were not helpful in determining distinguishing clinical features.</p><p>When sera were used to search for the presence of antibodies to specific recombinant antigens, multiple reactivities were found. The most prevalent finding was that of antibodies to CENP-B, which was observed primarily, but not exclusively, in patients with a speckled pattern. No clinical correlations were apparent in patients with specific antigens or in the 30 percent of patients without reactivity to the nuclear antigens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison with chronic hepatitis C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the features seen in autoimmune hepatitis occur in chronic viral hepatitis, including hypergammaglobulinemia and circulating autoantibodies. Approximately 5 percent of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection have ANA at titers of 1:100 or greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. One study compared ANA immunofluorescence patterns in patients with autoimmune hepatitis and chronic hepatitis C with a minimum titer of 1:40 using rat liver and kidney sections as a substrate; a homogeneous pattern was more common in ANA-positive autoimmune hepatitis cases than ANA-positive chronic hepatitis C (71 versus 38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>There are other ways to distinguish autoimmune hepatitis from hepatitis C. Patients with classic hepatitis C infection do not have prominent plasma cell infiltration on liver biopsy, a feature that is often prominent in autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis has been called &quot;plasma cell&quot; hepatitis in the past. In addition, patients with autoimmune hepatitis may have marked elevations in serum IgG, a feature that is unusual in patients with chronic hepatitis C, particularly in Caucasians. Rarely, patients have both hepatitis C and autoimmune hepatitis. In such cases, it is prudent to first treat the autoimmune hepatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTI-SMOOTH MUSCLE ANTIBODIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) are the second major class of autoantibodies that have proved useful in the diagnosis of type 1 autoimmune hepatitis. Although less prevalent than antinuclear antibodies (ANA), they are more specific, particularly when present in titers of 1:80 or more. In children, titers of 1:20 or greater are considered positive. In a study of autoimmune hepatitis in childhood, 26 of 32 children (81 percent) with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis had ASMA titers ranging from 1:10 to 1:2560 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiactin antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiactin antibodies (AAA) are more specific for type 1 autoimmune hepatitis than other autoantibodies, but until recently have not generally been measured in clinical laboratories in North America. ASMA titers of 1:320 or greater generally reflect the presence of AAA and can serve as a surrogate marker for these antibodies. In one study, for example, AAA were present much more frequently (86 versus 7 percent) in patients with ASMA than in patients without ASMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. AAA are closely associated with the HLA phenotypes B8 and DR3, which are associated with a poor prognosis in autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In another report, in patients with ASMA, those who also had AAA were more frequently HLA-B8-positive than those without these antibodies (49 versus 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>AAA (IgG anti-F-actin) measured by ELISA have become more readily available and, in some laboratories, have replaced ASMA in autoantibody profiles. They appear to be more sensitive and specific than ASMA measured by immunofluorescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison with chronic hepatitis C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circulating ASMA are also found in patients with chronic hepatitis C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The mean ASMA titer was higher in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (1:320 versus 1:40 in hepatitis C virus) in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There was, however, some overlap. The difference was much greater for AAA, which were present in 28 of 32 (87 percent) patients with autoimmune hepatitis patients compared with only 5 of 59 (8 percent) with chronic hepatitis C.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTI-SOLUBLE LIVER ANTIGEN/LIVER PANCREAS ANTIBODIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-soluble liver <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/liver</span> pancreas <span class=\"nowrap\">(anti-SLA/LP)</span> antibodies have been found in approximately 10 to 30 percent of adult patients with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], but are more common in children with both type 1 and type 2 disease. <span class=\"nowrap\">SLA/LP</span> is also known as O-phosphoserine (Sep)-tRNA:selenocysteine (Sec)-tRNA synthase (SepSecS). <span class=\"nowrap\">Anti-SLA/LP</span> antibodies were initially thought to be directed against several liver antigens, including cytokeratins 8 and 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and subunits of glutathione S-transferases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, subsequent cloning and characterization of the antigen revealed that it is a unique enzyme (possibly a UGA-suppressor or tRNA-associated protein) and is a member of the superfamily of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Furthermore, the antigen was identical to the liver-pancreas antigen, which has also been described in a subset of patients with autoimmune hepatitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>). The antibodies themselves are of the IgG1 subtypes, suggesting that they may arise from a specific immune stimulus such as a viral protein. However, no homologous virus-derived peptides could be identified in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Anti-SLA/LP</span> antibodies are the only circulating antibody in some patients, which originally led to their consideration as a distinct type (type 3) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-disease-classification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Disease classification&quot;</a>). Although these patients are no longer thought to represent a separate type, the isolated appearance of anti-SLA antibodies may help to identify patients who might otherwise have been classified as having &quot;cryptogenic chronic hepatitis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A study of 144 North American patients (15 percent of whom had <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-SLA/LP)</span> found a positive association with the serotype DR3 and a negative association with DR4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTINEUTROPHIL CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are a group of autoantibodies that recognize neutrophil proteins. The antibodies associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) and microscopic polyarteritis are directed against serine protease 3 (with a cytoplasmic or c-ANCA pattern on immunofluorescence) and myeloperoxidase (with a perinuclear or p-ANCA pattern on immunofluorescence). Atypical p-ANCA is also seen in inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis. These antibodies have a perinuclear or atypical staining pattern on immunofluorescence and appear to be directed against a myeloid 50-kd nuclear envelope protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Atypical p-ANCA have been identified in type 1 but not type 2 autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In one series from Italy, for example, atypical p-ANCA was identified in 30 of 46 (65 percent) patients with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis as defined by the presence of antinuclear antibodies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-smooth muscle antibodies at titers of 1:40 or greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Primary sclerosing cholangitis, which is often associated with underlying inflammatory bowel disease (usually ulcerative colitis), may be confused with autoimmune hepatitis because the latter may also be associated with ulcerative colitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIMITOCHONDRIAL ANTIBODIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), although more specific and sensitive for primary biliary cholangitis, also can occur in type 1 autoimmune hepatitis. The frequency of these autoantibodies in autoimmune hepatitis varied significantly across different reports, but is generally in the 5 to 20 percent range. One report from Italy found no AMA in 125 type 1 patients, which was due at least in part to a stricter definition of the autoimmune <span class=\"nowrap\">hepatitis/primary</span> biliary cholangitis overlap (variant) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-variants-definitions-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis variants: Definitions and treatment&quot;</a>). A long-term follow-up study of AMA-positive autoimmune hepatitis reported that no patients progressed to primary biliary cholangitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Anti-DNA antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not frequently sought, antibodies to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which are most commonly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) can occur in autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibodies-to-double-stranded-ds-dna-sm-and-u1-rnp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antibodies to double-stranded (ds)DNA, Sm, and U1 RNP&quot;</a>). Anti-dsDNA positivity is associated with the presence of HLA-DR4 and may identify a subset of patients less likely to respond to glucocorticoid therapy. Antibodies to ssDNA are common, but do not appear to distinguish among clinical patterns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTI-LIVER-KIDNEY MICROSOMAL-1 ANTIBODIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-liver-kidney microsomal-1 (ALKM-1) and anti-liver cytosol-1 (ALC-1) antibodies are the major autoantibodies in type 2 autoimmune hepatitis, a disease that occurs predominantly in girls and young women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65135\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65135 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/8,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26,27</a>]. ALKM-1 antibodies, which are directed at the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6, are also found in approximately 5 percent of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 25 percent of those with halothane-induced hepatitis and graft-versus-host disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The antibodies in autoimmune hepatitis are more homogeneous, titers are higher, and major autoepitopes on CYP2D6 are small and linear; by comparison, ALKM-1 antibodies in HCV are more heterogeneous and have multiple epitopes, many of which are conformational [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Cross-reactivity due to molecular mimicry between the CYP2D6 and HCV NS3 and Ns5a proteins might explain the presence of anti-LKM1 in some HCV patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTI-LIVER CYTOSOL ANTIBODY-1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ALC-1 is also a marker of type 2 autoimmune hepatitis.
