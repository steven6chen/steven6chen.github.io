The malignant cells in most patients with AML have non-random, acquired clonal chromosomal abnormalities. In some cases, specific cytogenetic abnormalities are closely, and sometimes uniquely, associated with morphologically and clinically distinct subsets of the disease. As such, the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues uses genetic findings in addition to morphologic, immunophenotypic, and clinical features to define distinct subtypes of AML. In addition to establishing the type of AML, specific cytogenetic abnormalities have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic importance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Remission criteria in acute myeloid leukemia and monitoring for residual disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Genetic features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-evaluation-and-prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-older-adults#H6273191\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment evaluation and prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia in older adults&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review selected cytogenetic abnormalities in both de novo AML and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN). An overview of cytogenetics in hematologic malignancies, including definitions, methods of detection, the genetic consequences of chromosomal translocations, and the relationship between these chromosomal abnormalities and the pathobiology of AML are discussed separately. A risk stratification of AML based upon molecular genetics is also presented separately.

Reciprocal translocation refers to an exchange between two or more chromosomes in which there is no obvious overall loss of chromosomal material. An example of a reciprocal translocation is the Philadelphia chromosome, t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2), seen in chronic myeloid leukemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosomal deletion (del) means loss of chromosomal material. An interstitial deletion results from two breaks in a single chromosome with the loss of intervening material. An example of an interstitial deletion is the 5q- syndrome, or myelodysplastic syndrome with an isolated del(5q), in which a variable portion (often the segment between bands q14 and q33) of the long arm of chromosome 5 is lost.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monosomy is a form of genetic loss in which an entire chromosome is lost (eg, monosomy 7 or -7).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosomal inversion (inv) requires two breaks in the same chromosome with rotation of the intervening material. An example is inv(16)(p13.1q22), wherein genes previously on opposite ends of chromosome 16 are juxtaposed after the rearrangement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosomal bands are alternating light and dark segments that result from various staining procedures.

Standard nomenclature is to include the translocation in one set of parentheses and the breakpoints in a second set of parentheses. Thus, this specific translocation would be denoted as t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2). As a result of this translocation, the <em>ABL1</em> gene at band 9q34.1 is juxtaposed with the <em>BCR</em> gene at band 22q11.2.

The correlation of cytogenetic abnormalities with the morphological features of acute leukemia was largely made possible by development of the French-American-British (FAB) classification system of the acute leukemias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

This translocation was initially thought to be restricted to patients with AML-M2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, 7 percent of 44 patients analyzed at the Fourth International Workshop who had a t(8;21) and adequate bone marrow material available for morphological review had a diagnosis of acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMMoL or AML-M4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>This translocation juxtaposes the <em>RUNX1</em> (previously <em>AML1</em> or core binding factor alpha-2) gene on chromosome 21 with the <em>RUNX1T1</em> (previously <em>ETO</em> or <em>MTG8</em>) gene on chromosome 8 to form a <em>RUNX1-RUNX1T1</em> chimeric product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>]. The RUNX1 protein is a member of a family of transcription factors with homology to the pair-rule Drosophila gene, Runt. RUNX1 heterodimerizes with another protein, core binding factor beta (CBFB, also known as PEBP2 beta), to form a transcription factor. The <em>CBFB</em> gene is located at 16q22, which is the breakpoint in the inv(16) and t(16;16) rearrangements. (See <a href=\"#H993131070\" class=\"local\">'Inv(16) and t(16;16)'</a> below.)</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">RUNX1/CBFB</span> transcription factor binds directly to an enhancer core motif that is present in the transcriptional regulatory regions of a number of genes that are critical to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell growth, differentiation, and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These genes are part of the <span class=\"nowrap\">JAK/STAT</span> signaling which contribute to increased survival of tumor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Mutant mice with loss of Runx1 or Cbfb gene function are deficient in hematopoiesis, and die during embryogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. A similar result has been noted in gene targeting studies in which the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">RUNX1/RUNX1T1</em></span> allele was &quot;knocked in&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The findings indicated that the <span class=\"nowrap\">RUNX1/CBFB-regulated</span> target genes are essential for hematopoiesis of all lineages. Among the genes regulated by <span class=\"nowrap\">RUNX1/CBFB</span> are those encoding interleukin-3 (<em>IL3</em>), <em>GM-CSF</em>, the CSF1 receptor, myeloperoxidase, and <em>ELANE</em> (neutrophil elastase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>RUNX1-RUNX1T1 can interact with the enhancer core motif, since the DNA-binding domain is retained, but it interferes with normal activation of gene expression by the normal <span class=\"nowrap\">RUNX1/CBFB</span> transcription factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20</a>]. In addition, RUNX1-RUNX1T1 has other functions, directly generating dysplastic hematopoietic progenitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] and possibly activating expression of other genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus, leukemogenesis by RUNX1-RUNX1T1 probably results from both altered transcriptional regulation of normal RUNX1 target genes and activation of new target genes that prevent programmed cell death <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cellular differentiation pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

This translocation has not been found in patients with any other type of leukemia or with a solid tumor, although there are rare cases of t(15;17) occurring in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), coincident with development of a promyelocytic blast crisis. It is one of the three cytogenetic abnormalities in AML which, if found, result in the diagnosis of AML regardless of blast count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The translocation results in a <em>PML</em>-<em>RARA</em> fusion gene that contains most of the <em>PML</em> coding sequences, and the DNA binding and ligand binding domains of the <em>RARA</em> gene. The PML-RARA fusion protein shows reduced sensitivity to retinoic acid in terms of dissociation of N-CoR, a ubiquitous nuclear protein that mediates transcriptional repression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/37,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39</a>]. This could lead to persistent transcriptional repression, thereby preventing differentiation of promyelocytes.

A characteristic folded, reniform (kidney-shaped), or bilobed nucleus is invariably found in some of the promyelocytes; coarse azurophilic granules and multiple Auer rods are also common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82863\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82863 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/25,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,36</a>]. The microgranular variant of APL differs from the more frequent hypergranular type in that the cytoplasmic granules in the leukemia cells are smaller and sometimes beneath the limit of resolution of the light microscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/25,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,36</a>].</p><p>APL represents a medical emergency with a high rate of early mortality, often due to hemorrhage from DIC. It is critical to start treatment with ATRA without delay as soon as the diagnosis is <strong>suspected</strong> based upon cytologic criteria, and before definitive cytogenetic confirmation of the diagnosis. The leukemic cells in patients with APL are exquisitely sensitive to the differentiating effect of ATRA. Patients with APL have an excellent prognosis when ATRA and chemotherapy are begun promptly. The PML-RARA gene can now be routinely identified within 24 hours by PCR methods, allowing confirmation of the diagnosis of APL. </p><p>Several variant chromosome translocation involving RARA, but not PML have been identified in APL, such as the t(5;17), and t(11;17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>].

Cases of APL that lack the t(15;17) do not respond to ATRA; the <em>PLZF-RARA</em> fusion protein that is produced in the t(11;17) rearrangement in rare cases shows reduced sensitivity to retinoic acid that cannot be overcome by pharmacologic doses of ATRA alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/37,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39</a>].

As described above, this transcription factor binds directly to an enhancer core motif that is present in the transcriptional regulatory regions of a number of genes that are critical to myeloid cell growth, differentiation, and function. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'8;21 translocation in AML'</a> above.)</p><p>A smooth muscle myosin heavy chain gene (<em>MYH11</em>) is interrupted by the breakpoint on 16p. A fusion protein is produced containing the 5' region of <em>CBFB</em> (165 of 182 amino acids), including the domain that heterodimerizes with RUNX1, fused to the 3' portion of <em>MYH11</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. This portion of MYH11 contains a repeated alpha helical structure involved in myosin filament interactions and may therefore be important in dimerization of the fusion protein in leukemia cells.

Conversely, while these morphologic changes are typical for this disorder, some patients with the <em>CBFB-MYH11</em> fusion gene do not have these abnormalities in most of their bone marrow eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Patients with inv(16) or t(16;16) have a good response to intensive chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/10,30,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,30,46</a>]. As an example, an analysis of 5876 younger adults with newly diagnosed AML reported that one of these two abnormalities was seen in 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The KMT2A protein has homology to the Drosophila trithorax gene product, a transcription factor that regulates embryonic development and tissue differentiation in this organism. KMT2A is a DNA-binding protein that methylates histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), and positively regulates gene expression by binding to open chromatin structures at the active promoter regions of various genes, including multiple <em>Hox</em> genes, that are important in hematopoietic and lymphoid cell development, including myelomonocytic differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>].</p><p>Translocations of <em>KMT2A</em> result in the formation of a chimeric gene on the derivative 11 chromosome, consisting of the 5' region of <em>KMT2A</em> and the 3' region of the partner gene from the other chromosome, with subsequent expression of fusion mRNAs. The most common translocation involves <em>KMT2A</em> and the <em>MLLT3</em> (<em>AF9</em>) gene at 9p21.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

A key feature of KMT2A fusion proteins is their ability to efficiently transform hematopoietic cells into leukemia stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. It has been presumed that altered KMT2A function contributes to leukemogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], but the partner gene also appears to be important. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that AML occurs in chimeric mice containing a <em>KMT2A-MLLT3</em> fusion gene from a t(9;11), but not in mice with a disrupted <em>KMT2A</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. At least four groups of KMT2A partner genes with various putative functions have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nuclear proteins AFF1 (AF4), MLLT3 (AF9), MLLT10 (AF10), MLLT1 (ENL) and OCEL1 (ELL) have putative DNA-binding functions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CREB binding protein <span class=\"nowrap\">(CREBBP/CBP)</span> and EP300 (P300) are histone acetyltransferases. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FOXO (AFX) and MLLT4 (AF6) contain the coil-coil oligomerization domains.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SEPT2, SEPT5, SEPT6, SEPT9 and SEPT11 belong to the Septin family that interacts with cytoskeletal filaments during the mitosis.</p><p/><p>It may be that the genes on the partner chromosomes interact with KMT2A to yield either the myeloid or the lymphoid phenotype of the corresponding leukemia. The leukemias associated with the <em>KMT2A-MLLT3</em> fusion gene in mice appear to be preceded by an initial stage of nonmalignant expansion of myeloid precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. It was suggested that a &quot;second hit&quot; was required for malignant transformation and that the myeloproliferation provided the pool of cells in which this event can occur.

Thus, only a single mutated allele with a partial tandem duplication appears to be sufficient for leukemogenesis. While the mechanism of leukemogenesis remains to be fully elucidated, cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) appears to play a critical role in this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

A few circulating megakaryoblasts may be seen, but these findings alone are not indicative of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.</p><p>The t(3;3) and inv(3) abnormalities seen in AML result in the activation of the <em>MECOM</em> (<em>EVI1</em>) gene, located at 3q26.2.

Depending on its binding partners, MECOM can act as a transcriptional activator to promote the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (eg, when bound to GATA2) or as a transcriptional repressor inhibiting erythroid differentiation (eg, when bound to GATA1).</p><p>Abnormal expression of <em><span class=\"nowrap\">MECOM/EVI1</em></span> has also been detected in patients with myeloid leukemia and a normal karyotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>], suggesting that inappropriate activation of this gene occurs through various mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>], and may confer an adverse prognosis.

The t(3;21)(q26.2;q22.1) has been linked to acute leukemia arising after cytotoxic therapy, and was first recognized in chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis and later in <span class=\"nowrap\">t-MDS/t-AML</span>. The translocation leads to the fusion of <em>MECOM</em> with the <em>RUNX1</em> gene at 21q22.1. The fusion is out-of-frame; thus, the <em>RUNX1</em> gene is truncated and loses its functional activity, whereas <em>MECOM</em> is overexpressed.

The pathological features of AML with the t(6;9) include basophilia, single or multilineage dysplasia in adult patients, variable FAB morphology, a CD13+, CD33+, CD38+, CD45+, and HLA-DR+ phenotype, and a high incidence (71 percent) of FLT3 internal tandem duplications. The translocation results in the juxtaposition of <em>DEK</em> on chromosome 6 with <em>NUP214</em> (also known as <em>CAN</em>) on chromosome 9. This results in the creation of a nucleoporin fusion protein that acts as a transcription factor and also alters nuclear transport. Patients with the t(6;9)(p23;q34.1) typically have a poor outcome with standard therapy. An analysis of 5876 younger adults with newly diagnosed AML reported that <em>DEK-NUP214</em> was seen in one percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These patients had rates of complete remission and 10-year survival of 88 and 27 percent, respectively. Corresponding rates for patients with a normal karyotype were 90 and 38 percent, respectively.

Each of the chromosomes could be affected, but there was a variable frequency. Some chromosomes were more likely to have a gain or loss. The most common abnormalities were a gain of chromosome 8 (trisomy 8, 13 percent), loss of chromosome 7 (9 percent), and loss of chromosome 5 (6 percent). A gain of chromosomes 7 or 5 was rarely observed. Of note, the incidence of monosomy 5 may have been overestimated in this study; subsequent studies using FISH have revealed that 5p is typically retained as part of a rearranged chromosome in cases previously identified as monosomy 5.

Using FISH analysis, genomic microarray assays, and mutation analysis, approximately 70 percent of patients with AML with a complex karyotype have <em>TP53</em> deletions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mutations, and a high degree of genomic complexity (an average of 14 aberrations per case) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. This genetic subgroup is often associated with a del(5q), or loss or deletion of chromosomes 7, 16, and 18, and gain of chromosomes 1 and 11. <em>TP53</em> alterations are associated with a dismal outcome and are the most important prognostic factor in AML with a complex karyotype. Indeed, abnormalities of 17p or <em>TP53</em> are predictive of a high risk of treatment failure in AML, even after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p>Chromothripsis is a &ldquo;single event&rdquo; genomic catastrophe that creates multiple gains and losses of chromosome regions and structural abnormalities, such as marker, derivative, or ring chromosomes. Chromothripsis results from chromosome shattering, followed by random rejoining and repair of the resultant fragments.

In another study, 18 (36 percent) of 49 marker or ring chromosomes studied by genomic array tests showed the features of chromothripsis, with extremely complex karyotypes, <em>TP53</em> mutations, and dismal prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p>Chromosomal gains and losses are seen in most subtypes of AML, although there are some differences in frequency, and certain abnormalities are seen with specific disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/9,28,106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,28,106,107</a>].

In one study of 1274 patients with AML and abnormal clones, 418 (32.8 percent) patients showed clonal heterogeneity; of these, 60 percent had multiple subclones that could be defined, and in the remaining 40 percent substantial heterogeneity necessitates the delineation of a composite clone (ie, an idealized clone that contains all clonally occurring abnormalities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].

Specific cytogenetic abnormalities are closely, and sometimes uniquely, associated with morphologically and clinically distinct subsets of the disease. As such, the WHO classification of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues uses genetic findings in addition to morphologic, immunophenotypic, and clinical features to define distinct subtypes of AML. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Karyotype'</a>.)&nbsp;</p><p>Using standard banding techniques, 50 to 60 percent of patients with AML de novo have abnormal karyotypes. The most common abnormalities seen on karyotype are t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1), trisomy 8, t(8;21)(q22;q22.1), inv(16)(p13.<span class=\"nowrap\">1q22)/t(16;16)(p13</span>.1;q22), and 11q rearrangements. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Acute myeloid leukemia de novo'</a> above.)</p><p>The following cytogenetic abnormalities, if found, result in the diagnosis of AML regardless of blast count:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AML with the t(8;21)(q22;q22.1); <em>RUNX1-RUNX1T1</em> (previously <em>AML1-ETO</em>) &ndash; This translocation is seen in approximately 7 percent of adults with newly diagnosed AML and is the most frequent abnormality in children with AML. The <em>RUNX1</em> (previously <em>AML1</em> or core binding factor alpha-2) gene on chromosome 21 and the <em>RUNX1T1</em> (previously ETO or MTG8) gene on chromosome 8 form a chimeric product that regulates the transcription of a number of genes that are critical to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell growth, differentiation, and function. Cases of AML with the t(8;21) have a morphologically distinct phenotype. It portends a favorable prognosis in adults, but a poor prognosis in children. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'8;21 translocation in AML'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AML with the inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); <em>CBFB-MYH11</em> &ndash; AML with inv(16) represents approximately 5 percent of newly diagnosed AML and typically demonstrates monocytic and granulocytic differentiation with abnormal eosinophils in the bone marrow. The resultant <span class=\"nowrap\">CBFB/MYH11</span> fusion protein disrupts the function of the <span class=\"nowrap\">RUNX1/CBFB</span> transcription factor, resulting in the repression of transcription. Patients with inv(16) generally have a good response to intensive chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H993131070\" class=\"local\">'Inv(16) and t(16;16)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>APL with t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.2); PML-RARA &ndash; This translocation is highly specific for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and results in a PML-RARA fusion protein that is thought to lead to persistent transcriptional repression, thereby preventing differentiation of promyelocytes. APL represents a medical emergency with a high rate of early mortality, often due to hemorrhage from disseminated intravascular coagulation. It is critical to start treatment as the diagnosis is <strong>suspected</strong> based upon cytologic criteria, and before definitive cytogenetic confirmation of the diagnosis. Patients with APL have an excellent prognosis when appropriate treatment is begun promptly. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'15;17 translocation in APL'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular biology of acute promyelocytic leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>In addition, the following four AML subtypes, which require at least 20 percent myeloid blasts for diagnosis, have been identified as subcategories of AML with genetic abnormalities of prognostic significance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AML with t(9;11)(p21.3;q23.3); <em>KMT2A-MLLT3</em> &ndash; There are over 100 different recurring rearrangements that involve 11q23.3, with many different translocation partners in AML, especially the monoblastic and myelomonocytic types. The t(9;11) is the most common and involves the <em>KMT2A</em> gene and <em>MLLT3</em> (<em>AF9</em>). These patients tend to have an intermediate response to standard therapy. (See <a href=\"#H993131111\" class=\"local\">'Rearrangements of 11q23.3'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AML with t(6;9)(p23;q34.1); <em>DEK-NUP214</em> &ndash; This abnormality is seen in approximately 1 percent of patients with newly diagnosed AML, and cases with this translocation are characterized by basophilia, pancytopenia, and dysplasia. Patients with this abnormality have a poor response to standard therapy, which may be a result of the lesion itself or its association with <em>FLT3</em>-ITD, which is also known to convey a poor prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H983671238\" class=\"local\">'t(6;9)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AML with inv(3)(q21.3q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21.3;q26.2); <em><span class=\"nowrap\">MECOM/EVI1</em></span> &ndash; The t(3;3) and inv(3) account for approximately 1 percent of AML cases and are associated with a poor response to therapy. These cytogenetic changes lead to the overexpression of the <em>MECOM</em> gene, which is thought to result in the peripheral blood thrombocytosis and increased atypical megakaryocytes in the bone marrow characteristic of cases with this abnormality. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'t(3;3) and inv(3) in AML with thrombocytosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AML (megakaryoblastic) with t(1;22)(p13.3;q13.1); <em>RBM15-MKL1</em> &ndash; This type of leukemia is also rare, but is typically a megakaryoblastic process occurring in infants, although it is not seen in patients with Down syndrome. The prognostic significance of the t(1;22)(p13.3;q13.1) with modern therapy is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H983671253\" class=\"local\">'t(1;22)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Characteristic chromosomal abnormalities have also been identified in patients who developed a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or AML after chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy for an earlier disorder. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MDS/t-AML)'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common type of therapy-related <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/AML</span> is due to damage from alkylating agents and is characterized by abnormalities in chromosomes 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 7. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Following alkylating agents and/or radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second most common subtype of therapy-related AML occurs in patients who have been treated with chemotherapeutic drugs that inhibit DNA topoisomerase II (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teniposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teniposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitoxantrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitoxantrone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epirubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epirubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexrazoxane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexrazoxane</a>). AML associated with these drugs is often characterized by balanced translocations involving the <em>KMT2A</em> gene at 11q23.3, or the RUNX1 gene at 21q22.1.
