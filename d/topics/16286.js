SCS involves percutaneous or surgical implantation of electrodes in the epidural space, with power supplied by an implanted battery.</p><p>This topic will discuss placement of spinal cord stimulators, management of anesthesia for spinal cord stimulator placement, and management of SCS for patients who undergo other surgical procedures. It does not address the technique for laminectomy and surgical lead placement or peripheral nerve stimulation. Evaluation of chronic pain, alternatives for therapy of chronic pain, and SCS for the treatment of specific conditions are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of chronic pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-therapies-for-treating-symptoms-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease#H135432878\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational therapies for treating symptoms of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;, section on 'Spinal cord stimulation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management#H859577380\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Prevention and management&quot;, section on 'Spinal cord stimulation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1065065421\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complex mechanism of action of SCS has not been fully elucidated and is probably multifactorial. The analgesia provided by SCS for neuropathic pain appears to differ from that provided for the relief of ischemic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The mechanisms described below pertain to conventional or standard SCS. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying pain relief from the newer SCS technologies such as high frequency and burst stimulation. (See <a href=\"#H3362837742\" class=\"local\">'Implantable pulse generators'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neuropathic pain relief</strong> &ndash; SCS was originally thought to work through a gate control mechanism in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Thus, spinal cord stimulators were called dorsal column stimulators. According to gate control theory, the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn was a functional &quot;gate system&quot; where pain was modulated. Small (painful A delta and C) nerve fibers and large (A beta) nerve fibers synapse at the &quot;gate.&quot; Large fiber activation inhibited the painful small fibers, closing the &quot;gate&quot; and relieving pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mechanism for pain relief with conventional SCS is now known to be more complex, and much of what is known comes from laboratory and animal studies. Relief of neuropathic pain by SCS is mediated in part by spinal mechanisms whereby there is wide dynamic range (WDR) neuron suppression in the dorsal horn. This involves spinal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems and their effect on excitatory amino acid (EAA) activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The cholinergic system is also thought to be involved, as animal studies have shown dorsal horn acetylcholine release during SCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Supraspinal mechanisms of SCS occur via descending inhibitory pathways and are also thought to contribute significantly to the effects of SCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pain relief from SCS can often be realized for days or even weeks after the stimulation has been turned off, which underscores the importance of supraspinal mechanisms of action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. An electroencephalographic (EEG) study of patients with chronic lower extremity neuropathic pain found that long-term SCS influenced both pain thresholds and cortical signaling, further evidence of a more central mechanism of analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ischemic pain relief</strong> &ndash; SCS analgesia in ischemic pain is more likely related to restoring the oxygen supply and demand imbalance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Reduction of tissue ischemia is thought to be the result of increasing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> redistributing blood flow to the area of tissue ischemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreasing tissue oxygen demand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Vasodilatory effects of SCS may include the release of vasodilatory substances by sensory fibers via antidromic activation or actions on the sympathetic nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H527145718\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, SCS should be considered for patients with chronic pain who have failed conservative approaches. A spinal cord stimulator is not effective for all types of chronic pain, and is not effective for every patient with categories of pain that may respond. In the United States, the most common indication for spinal cord stimulator placement is chronic pain from failed back surgery syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. In Europe, spinal cord stimulators are commonly placed for painful peripheral vascular disease and for refractory angina.</p><p>Indications for SCS include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Failed back surgery syndrome</strong> &ndash; There is moderate-quality evidence supporting the use of SCS in patients with persistent radicular pain due to failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). The benefits of SCS for patients with primarily axial back pain with FBSS are less clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment#H1499964507\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'Spinal cord stimulation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Axial back pain is more difficult to treat than radicular pain, and technical modifications including both hardware refinement and computerized stimulus modification are being studied. Newer forms of high frequency stimulation show promise for treatment of axial low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complex</strong> <strong>regional pain syndrome</strong> &ndash; SCS may be helpful for complex regional pain syndrome refractory to conventional therapy, particularly in patients with disease limited to one extremity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management#H859577380\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Prevention and management&quot;, section on 'Spinal cord stimulation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Painful peripheral vascular disease</strong> &ndash; Painful, inoperable peripheral vascular disease is the most common indication for SCS in Europe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-therapies-for-treating-symptoms-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease#H135432878\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational therapies for treating symptoms of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;, section on 'Spinal cord stimulation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intractable angina </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>SCS may be beneficial for patients with refractory angina. The technique is safe, has anti-ischemic effects, may improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and may increase quality of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New therapies for angina pectoris&quot;, section on 'Spinal cord stimulation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other indications </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Retrospective reviews and case reports suggest that SCS may be beneficial for patients with visceral abdominal and perineal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>] and for painful diabetic neuropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy#H459988924\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic neuropathy&quot;, section on 'Spinal cord stimulation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with these and other chronic pain syndromes should be evaluated individually for spinal cord stimulator placement.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1824770948\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient selection is an important determinant of successful SCS. In addition to evaluation of the type of chronic pain and appropriateness for SCS therapy, patients should be screened for comorbidities, contraindications to the technique, and potential technical difficulty.</p><p>A history and physical examination should be performed prior to spinal cord stimulator placement to assess for medical conditions that increase risk of failure or complications.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coagulopathy</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Patients who undergo neuraxial procedures, including spinal cord stimulator placement, are at risk for spinal epidural hematoma, which can result in permanent neurologic damage. The baseline risk is low but is increased for patients with coagulopathy related to medical conditions or administration of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications. Uncontrolled coagulopathy and severe thrombocytopenia are contraindications to spinal cord stimulator trial or implant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We agree with the Joint Guidelines for Interventional Spine and Pain Procedures in Patients on Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Medications published by a consortium of international pain societies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These guidelines classify spinal cord stimulator trial and implant as procedures with high potential risk of serious intraspinal bleeding and provide guidance for discontinuation and reinstitution of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications. A summary of those guidelines and a checklist for anticoagulation management for interventional spine procedures are shown in tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108917\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108917 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108918\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108918 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Peri-procedure management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications should be coordinated with the patient's medical care providers. The risk of complications associated with withholding these medications may affect the length of the spinal cord stimulator trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The incidence of spinal epidural hematoma from an in-situ spinal cord stimulator in patients who are chronically taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Decisions to place stimulators in these patients must be individualized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic or local infection</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Active infection is a contraindication to spinal cord stimulator trial and implantation. We do not consider human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) a contraindication for spinal cord stimulator placement; in case reports, SCS has been effective for HIV-related polyneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pacemakers</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>For patients with cardiac pacemakers and internal cardiac defibrillators, compatibility with SCS should be established prior to spinal cord stimulator trial. Spinal cord stimulators have little interaction with the newer pacemakers, provided strict bipolar right ventricular sensing is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. Patients with defibrillators require closer observation to ensure stimulation does not result in defibrillator discharge. For patients with pacemakers, we generally consult a cardiologist as part of preprocedure evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory evaluation</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>We perform laboratory evaluation as dictated by the medical history. If the spinal cord stimulator trial is successful, further preoperative testing is performed as usual for anesthesia, prior to permanent spinal cord stimulator implantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imaging studies</strong> &ndash; Spine imaging studies should be reviewed to anticipate technical difficulty and to identify those patients for whom surgery may be more appropriate than SCS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychological screening</strong> &ndash; Psychological screening should be performed prior to spinal cord stimulator placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>] and may be required by insurance companies for approval for payment. We send most patients for psychological evaluation as part of the preprocedure process. A systematic review found that high levels of depression, anxiety, coping, somatization, and hypochondriasis are associated with worse outcome for lumbar surgery and SCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Having one of these diagnoses, rather than being an absolute contraindication, is an indication for treatment of those conditions prior to consideration of SCS or other similarly invasive procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Duration of pain </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>SCS may be less effective if performed many years after the onset of chronic pain. A retrospective review of 400 cases in one institution reported a success rate of approximately 85 percent for SCS placed less than two years after onset of pain, versus 9 percent with a delay of over 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4102269508\"><span class=\"h1\">EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal cord stimulators consist of a stimulation lead(s), an implantable pulse generator (battery), and an extension cable that connects the lead with the generator.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3362837742\"><span class=\"h2\">Implantable pulse generators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of companies manufacture spinal cord stimulator generators and leads. The implantable pulse generator (IPG) delivers electrical stimulation that can be modified by altering the pulse width, frequency, and amplitude to achieve maximal pain suppression. The distinguishing characteristics include the method used for controlling electrical energy (ie, constant current versus constant voltage), the frequency range, tonic versus burst stimulation, rechargeable versus non-rechargeable implantable pulse generator, characteristics of the leads, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatibility.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Electrical control</strong> &ndash; Standard pulse generators deliver tonic pulses that keep either the voltage or current constant to stimulate tissue with variable impedance related to scar tissue and other factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Frequency</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Standard SCS generators deliver stimulation at relatively low frequencies (ie, 50-Hz range). However, animal and human studies suggest that higher-frequency stimulation (eg, 1 to 10 kHz) may be effective for some chronic pain conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A novel, high-frequency (HF) generator (HF 10 SCS) uses a biphasic stimulator wave form with pulse widths of approximately 30 microseconds at a rate of 10,000 Hz [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/17,18,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,35</a>]. Specific programming algorithms are used to achieve the best result.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Differences between HF and low-frequency (LF) generators include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HF spinal cord stimulators do not cause paresthesias. HF 10 stimulator leads are placed empirically based on the location of pain, usually with one lead-tip at the top of T8 and the other lead at T9 in order to consistently capture low back and leg pain, in accordance with an algorithm. Because patient feedback is not required for placement, the trial and implant procedure time is shortened by that time normally spent obtaining coverage of the painful areas with paresthesias. The trial and the implant can theoretically be performed under general anesthesia (GA), if necessary. Caution should be used with percutaneous placement under GA due to the risk of undetected nerve or spinal cord trauma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The lack of paresthesias is an advantage for patients who find them unpleasant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Studies comparing the efficacy of HF 10 with LF SCS have shown mixed results. A prospective trial that randomly assigned 171 patients with back and leg pain from several etiologies to HF 10 SCS or standard SCS therapy reported better pain control with HF 10 therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Compared with standard SCS therapy, HF 10 resulted in a greater percentage of patients achieving &ge;50 percent reduction in back pain (85 versus 44 percent) and leg pain (83 versus 55 percent) at 3 months and 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Twenty-four month follow-up continued to show &gt;50 percent pain relief in low back and leg pain, with greater relief of low back pain (67 percent relief) versus standard SCS (41 percent relief) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Another prospective trial of HF 10 SCS in 83 patients with back pain from mixed etiologies reported that more than 70 percent had &gt;50 percent relief of pain at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In contrast, a randomized trial including 55 patients with refractory back pain due to failed back surgery syndrome reported an average of 20 to 25 percent reduction in pain scores with no difference in pain at one year between HF SCS (ranging from 2 Hz to 10,000 Hz) and LF SCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HF 10 SCS uses more energy and may require more frequent battery charging compared with standard SCS, though the battery life before replacement is comparable at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Burst stimulation</strong> &ndash; Burst stimulation is a new form of SCS that consists of five HF (500-Hz) burst spikes delivered at a rate of 40 Hz, with a pulse width of 1 microsecond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Effective burst stimulation is less likely to cause paresthesias and may achieve better reduction of neuropathic pain than standard tonic stimulation. In one trial, 15 patients with neuropathic back or neck pain were randomly assigned to burst SCS, tonic SCS, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/33,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,39</a>]. When compared with standard tonic stimulation, burst stimulation resulted in a higher percent of patients with back pain improvement (51 versus 30 percent). Electroencephalographic&nbsp;(EEG) analysis of five of the patients in the study suggested that burst and tonic SCS have different effects on pain modulation pathways in the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Battery type</strong> &ndash; Many SCS implanted pulse generators (IPGs) are powered by batteries, which are recharged through the patient's skin with external chargers, typically held in place with adhesive patches or in pouches that are held in place with a strap. Some manufacturers make devices with primary cell batteries, with battery life that depends on the settings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The lifespan of the IPG is approximately four to seven years for those with non-rechargeable batteries and nine years for those with rechargeable batteries. The non-rechargeable batteries are larger than the rechargeable batteries and may not be suitable for patients with very little subcutaneous fat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wireless SCS</strong> &ndash; A novel wireless SCS system has been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. It includes an electrode and built-in receiver that communicates wirelessly through the skin to a transmitter and battery worn by the patient. Studies are ongoing to determine the optimal use for this technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MRI compatibility</strong> &ndash; Over 80 percent of patients with SCS will need an MRI within five years of implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Therefore, MRI compatibility is an important feature for all spinal cord stimulator components. Concerns include the possibility of lead movement or heating, hardware damage, and reprogramming as a result of radiofrequency (RF) energy. Most spinal cord stimulator components are designated as MRI conditional and can safely be used for MRI of the head and extremities under specific conditions. Some systems are MRI conditionally safe for whole-body MRI; manufacturers' specifications vary and should be followed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633302148\"><span class=\"h2\">Leads</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two categories of leads for spinal cord stimulators are cylindrical and paddle leads. Cylindrical leads are most commonly used for percutaneous procedures, while paddle leads are typically placed surgically.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cylindrical leads</strong> &ndash; Cylindrical leads can be placed through a 14-gauge epidural needle, and emit current circumferentially. Cylindrical leads are usually easily removed if necessary, even after prolonged periods. Lead migration may occur, especially in the early postprocedure period. (See <a href=\"#H3250063517\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgical paddle leads</strong> &ndash; Surgically placed &quot;paddle leads&quot; are flat in shape and have two to five columns of electrodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108914\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108914 \">image 1</a>). They provide unidirectional stimulation directed towards the spinal cord, which allows deeper penetration of the electrical stimulus. Paddle leads are bulkier than cylindrical leads and should be avoided in areas of spinal stenosis. If surgical paddle leads are sutured in place, lead migration does not occur, but surgical removal is required to avoid dural tear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Percutaneous paddle leads</strong> &ndash; The Epiducer is a novel lead entry system that allows insertion of multiple leads percutaneously, including an S-Series paddle lead, at the level of L1 or below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. This technique avoids the need for laminectomy, but lead migration can still occur if the leads are not adequately secured to the fascia. This system requires specific training and can be used for selected patients with optimal anatomy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1058823300\"><span class=\"h2\">Programmers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is given a handheld programmer with settings determined by the stimulation that best relieves the patient's pain. The patient can choose between two or three programmed settings as necessary, and the pain clinician can adjust the choice of settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H753635965\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous spinal cord stimulators are placed in two stages that consist of a trial period to prove efficacy, followed by final implantation. Both the trial and implantation are performed under fluoroscopic guidance and are outpatient procedures. Both trial and implantation are performed with strict aseptic technique, with full skin preparation and draping, and with preprocedure administration of antibiotics.</p><p>For surgical lead placement, a percutaneous trial is performed as it would be for percutaneous final implant.
