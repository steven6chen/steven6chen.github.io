The different forms of SpA share a group of clinical features; the most distinguishing features are inflammation of axial joints (especially the sacroiliac [SI] joints), asymmetric oligoarthritis (especially of the lower extremities), dactylitis (sausage digits), and enthesitis (inflammation at sites of ligamentous or tendon attachment to bone).</p><p>Additional features include skin and genital lesions, eye and bowel inflammation, an association with preceding or ongoing infectious disorders, positive family history, elevated acute phase reactants, and a strong association with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other terms that have been used for this family of arthritis are spondyloarthritides, spondyloarthropathy, and spondyloarthropathies.</p><p>An overview of the clinical manifestations and the classification of SpA in adults will be presented here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of AS and nr-axSpA, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis (formerly called Reiter&rsquo;s syndrome), and SpA in children are discussed separately, as is an overview of peripheral SpA.

The diagnosis and management approaches for patients suspected of having any type of SpA are also generally similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Axial SpA patients with definite radiographic sacroiliitis usually can be diagnosed with AS, while patients with axial SpA who do not show radiographic changes of sacroiliitis or have only very mild changes are classified as having nr-axSpA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients with nr-axSpA were formerly included in a category termed &ldquo;undifferentiated SpA&rdquo; (USpA), but are generally considered clinically, diagnostically, and for management purposes together with patients with AS.</p><p>The smaller number of patients with predominantly peripheral manifestations of SpA (eg, arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis, rather than back and spine pain) who do not meet established classification criteria for AS, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or SpA related to inflammatory bowel disorders can be considered as having peripheral SpA, but often evolve to develop a specific diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peripheral spondyloarthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Historically, the term &ldquo;Reiter&rsquo;s syndrome&rdquo; was often used to refer either to reactive arthritis or patients with a subset of features seen in some patients with reactive arthritis, including the triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis; the term &ldquo;reactive arthritis&rdquo; is preferred for practical and historical reasons and encompasses these patients as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The prevalences of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have been reported in Europe as between 0.12 and 1.0 percent, dependent also on the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 background prevalence, and as 0.17 percent in Asia, 0.1 percent in Latin America, and 0.07 percent in Africa. The prevalence for the whole group of axial SpA has been estimated to be two to three times higher than that of AS alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The estimated prevalence of axial SpA in the United States was as high as approximately 1.0 to 1.4 percent in a 2010 population survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. AS and non-radiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA) are the most frequent types of SpA. In the United States, they each have a prevalence of about 0.35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Reactive arthritis is much less frequent. The epidemiologic characteristics of the individual forms of SpA are described in detail separately.

Patients with axial SpA characteristically have chronic low back pain. Patients with either axial or peripheral SpA can exhibit peripheral musculoskeletal features, which include dactylitis (sausage digits), enthesitis (heel pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swelling), and peripheral arthritis. Patients with peripheral SpA may experience one or more of these peripheral manifestations concurrently or in the past.</p><p>Certain non-musculoskeletal manifestations are typically associated with the musculoskeletal features seen in SpA, including uveitis, psoriasis, features of inflammatory bowel diseases, and others. Reactive arthritis is sometimes associated with genital lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26417753\"><span class=\"h2\">Major musculoskeletal features</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low back <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/inflammatory</span> back pain</strong> &ndash; Patients with axial SpA typically have chronic low back pain of more than three months&rsquo; duration; in most axial SpA patients, the onset of low back pain is before age 45. However, chronic low back pain of all causes is common, with a prevalence estimated at about 20 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; only a small minority of these individuals has axial SpA. (See <a href=\"#H26417741\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A combination of low back pain features designated as &ldquo;inflammatory back pain&rdquo; is present in 70 to 80 percent of patients with axial SpA. These features include an insidious onset, most often before the age of 40 years; improvement with exercise but not with rest; and pain at night. However, inflammatory low back pain is also observed in 20 to 25 percent of back pain from other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, despite its prevalence among patients with AS, only a minority of individuals with symptoms characteristic of inflammatory back pain will have SpA, and the lack of typical features of inflammatory back pain does not exclude axial SpA in a chronic back pain patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults&quot;, section on 'Low back pain and neck pain'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An additional feature of low back pain in some patients with axial SpA is a good response to treatment with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID). Patients with back pain of many causes may improve somewhat when treated with an NSAID, but marked improvement in pain within 24 to 48 hours is more typical of SpA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The low back involvement in SpA is characterized more by the pattern of pain than by the range of motion of the spine, which may become restricted over the course of the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral arthritis</strong> &ndash; The peripheral arthritis in SpA usually has an acute onset; often predominantly involves the lower extremities, especially the knees and ankles; and is associated with swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Arthritis is frequently asymmetrical and often affects only one to three joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The severity ranges from mild to disabling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. When compared with other rheumatic diseases, the sensitivity and specificity of asymmetric oligoarthritis for SpA are 41 and 87 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thus, the presence of asymmetrical oligoarthritis is very suggestive of SpA, but its absence would not be helpful in excluding this possibility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Enthesitis (enthesopathy)</strong> &ndash; Enthesitis (or enthesopathy) refers to inflammation around the enthesis, which is the site of insertion of ligaments, tendons, joint capsule, or fascia to bone, and is relatively specific to SpA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The enthesis is composed of dense collagen, fibrocartilage, adjacent bursae, and synovial folds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The most common observable clinical manifestation of enthesitis is swelling at the heels, at the insertion of the Achilles tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81198\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81198 \">figure 1</a>), or at the insertion of the plantar fascia ligament into the calcaneus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It is usually associated with severe pain and tenderness. During physical examination, the patient with plantar fasciitis may have difficulty walking on the heels when barefoot. Swelling at the site of the Achilles tendon can be appreciated when the patient is observed in the standing position from behind. On palpation, there is tenderness at the sites of insertion of the Achilles tendon <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> of the plantar fascia on the calcaneus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other sites of enthesitis which are not swollen but which can be painful <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tender include those at the iliac crests, greater trochanters, epicondyles at the elbows, tibial plateaus, costochondral junctions at the sternum, humeral tuberosities, manubrial-sternal joints, occiput, and spinous processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dactylitis (sausage digits)</strong> &ndash; A characteristic feature of SpA, especially psoriatic arthritis and occasionally reactive arthritis, is dactylitis, also known sausage toe or sausage finger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F61696\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61696 \">picture 1</a>). Unlike synovitis, in which swelling is confined to the joints, with dactylitis, the entire digit is swollen. Joints do not show the discrete palpable fusiform swelling of synovitis, and there may be surprisingly little pain or tenderness. The diffuse swelling arises from flexor tendon, sheath, and marked adjacent soft tissue involvement, but may also involve the bone and joints. Dactylitis is not specific for SpA and may also be seen when the digits are involved with tuberculosis, syphilis, sarcoidosis, sickle cell disease, and tophaceous gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other musculoskeletal features</strong> &ndash; Additional musculoskeletal features often seen in patients with SpA include anterior chest wall or rib cage pain. These are relatively nonspecific. More specific for axial SpA is pain that alternates between the left and the right gluteal regions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H48809459\"><span class=\"h2\">Major non-musculoskeletal features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major non-musculoskeletal features are uveitis, associated inflammatory bowel diseases, and psoriasis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammatory eye disease</strong> &ndash; Several forms of ocular inflammatory disease can be associated with SpA, including conjunctivitis and anterior uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Conjunctivitis is typically non-purulent and transient, with symptoms subsiding within a few weeks. A more serious problem is anterior uveitis (iritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The initial attack is usually acute and unilateral and may be the presenting problem. Patients complain of redness, pain, and photophobia. Uveitis may be the first problem to require medical evaluation and should alert clinicians to the possibility of SpA. About 50 percent of patients with acute recurrent unilateral anterior uveitis have a form of SpA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although ocular inflammation usually responds to topical therapy, 10 percent can become chronic and threaten permanent impairment of vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An accurate diagnosis of uveitis requires slit-lamp examination by an ophthalmologist or other expert in uveitis. Episodes of uveitis do not necessarily parallel the course of arthritis.

In a systematic review. the pooled prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease among patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) was 6.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Conversely, musculoskeletal symptoms are the most common extraintestinal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Some experts have suggested that all forms of arthritis associated with psoriasis should be classified as part of the SpA family, but this remains a matter of debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Psoriasis is present in up to approximately 10 percent of patients with AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28</a>]. In patients with AS, it was found that peripheral joint involvement is more frequently seen with concomitant psoriasis, and the disease course may be more severe than in patients without psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-and-classification-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26417801\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no laboratory findings that are absolutely specific for spondyloarthritis (SpA).

There is a strong association with sacroiliitis on imaging and also with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27. (See <a href=\"#H26417735\" class=\"local\">'Forms of spondyloarthritis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26417747\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26417801\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders considered as forms of SpA include ankylosing spondylitis (AS), non-radiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA), peripheral SpA, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease-related arthritis, reactive arthritis (formerly called Reiter&rsquo;s syndrome), and SpA in children. (See <a href=\"#H26417735\" class=\"local\">'Forms of spondyloarthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristic imaging findings that may be seen in patients with SpA include sacroiliitis, which may result in sclerosis, joint space widening, or erosion, and is relatively specific for SpA on plain radiography; and syndesmophytes and changes of spondylitis in the spine, which are most often detected in more longstanding disease. Evidence of sacroiliitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with normal plain radiography may be seen in patients with nr-axSpA. (See <a href=\"#H26417825\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sets of classification criteria for axial and peripheral SpA have been developed for epidemiologic and clinical research purposes. The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria broadly distinguish between axial SpA (AS and nr-axSpA) and peripheral SpA; the ASAS criteria are inclusive of disorders such as psoriatic arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease-related arthritis.
