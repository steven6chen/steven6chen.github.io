However, subclinical vitamin D deficiency occurs even in developed countries and is associated with osteoporosis, increased risk of falls, and possibly fractures. Vitamin D stores decline with age, especially in the winter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

Thus, identification and treatment of vitamin D deficiency is important for musculoskeletal health and possibly even extraskeletal health, including the immune and cardiovascular systems.

Experts agree that levels lower than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> are suboptimal for skeletal health. The optimal serum 25(OH)D concentrations for extraskeletal health have not been established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D and extraskeletal health&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The IOM supports 25(OH)D concentrations above 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These recommendations are based upon evidence related to bone health.

However, there was some concern at serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (125 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>.

Since 2010, the Vitamin D Standardization Program has coordinated an international effort to standardize the laboratory measurement of 25(OH)D to the gold standard reference assays or reference measurement procedures developed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), Ghent University, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Vitamin D (or vitamin D-binding proteins) measured by liquid <span class=\"nowrap\">chromatography/tandem</span> mass spectrometry <span class=\"nowrap\">(LC-MS/MS)</span> or a comparable high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique when used with the NIST standard is the most accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14165621\"><span class=\"h2\">Criteria to define optimal 25(OH)D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several criteria by which to define the optimal serum 25(OH)D concentration, including maximal suppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by vitamin D, adequate renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D to ensure adequate intestinal calcium absorption, and optimal level to prevent a defined clinical endpoint (eg, fracture).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maximal suppression of PTH</strong> &ndash; As 25(OH)D levels fall, intestinal absorption of calcium falls, leading to a decrease in serum calcium. As a result, serum PTH concentrations rise, resulting in stimulation of the conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and thereby maintenance of absorption of calcium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65360\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65360 \">figure 1</a>).

The 25(OH)D level at which this occurs is estimated to be approximately 4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (11 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Thus, serum 25(OH)D concentrations below 4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (11 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> have been associated with decreased calcium absorptive efficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fracture prevention</strong> &ndash; The optimal 25(OH)D concentration may also be defined by a clinical endpoint, such as fracture reduction.

Serum 25(OH)D concentrations are variable, depending upon the assay method used. Using a monoclonal sandwich assay in a multiethnic cohort study, low vitamin D-binding protein levels were more common in blacks than whites, and consequently, the amounts of bioavailable vitamin D in blacks and whites were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The variability in vitamin D-binding proteins accounted for a large proportion of the variation in serum total 25(OH)D levels. However, this finding has been disputed because of the assay measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/18,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,29</a>]. As an example, when the vitamin D-binding proteins were measured with <span class=\"nowrap\">LS-MS/MS,</span> the values were not low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and therefore, it is uncertain whether vitamin D-binding protein levels differ by race or whether there are racial differences in serum 25(OH)D. These findings underscore the importance of the assay method used to determine vitamin D and its binding proteins. Whether direct measurement of a bioavailable or &quot;free&quot; serum 25(OH)D would be preferable to current assays for determination of vitamin D status is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H14165615\" class=\"local\">'Assay issues'</a> above.)</p><p>There is very little evidence about effects of vitamin D (or calcium supplementation) in persons who are not Caucasian, but since racial differences in mineral metabolism are substantial, we cannot apply findings from one race to other races.

However, many patients have serum vitamin D levels assessed as part of an evaluation for known osteoporosis (diagnosed on bone mineral density or due to a fragility fracture). In such patients with severely low vitamin D levels (and particularly if the serum PTH is high), the need for osteoporosis therapy should be reevaluated after vitamin D repletion. In severely vitamin D deficient patients, there can be marked increases in bone mineral density after treatment of osteomalacia with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, such that treatment for &quot;osteoporosis&quot; is not necessary.

Many patients with subclinical vitamin D deficiency have relative hypocalcemia and high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations, which may contribute to the development of osteoporosis and to an increased risk of fractures and falls in older adults. This secondary hyperparathyroidism can be attenuated by the administration of vitamin D supplements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>].

With prolonged, severe vitamin D deficiency, there is reduced intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus and hypocalcemia occurs, causing secondary hyperparathyroidism, which leads to phosphaturia, demineralization of bones, and, when prolonged, osteomalacia in adults.
