These agents reduce the signs and symptoms of inflammation and exhibit a broad range of pharmacologic activities, including analgesic, antipyretic, and antiplatelet properties. Aspirin was first introduced by the drug and dye firm Bayer in 1899. Aspirin and the other NSAIDs do not generally change the course of the disease process in those conditions where they are used for symptomatic relief.</p><p>The mechanism of action, efficacy, and toxicity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in rheumatic and other inflammatory disorders are reviewed here. The nonsalicylate NSAIDs, including nonspecific NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective agents; the use of aspirin for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease; and the prevention of gastroduodenal and other toxicities from aspirin are discussed in detail elsewhere.

However, the usefulness of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> at these high doses is limited by toxicity, including tinnitus, hearing loss, and gastric intolerance.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyclooxygenase inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>COX inhibition is central to the mechanism of action of both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and the nonsalicylate nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The role of COX inhibition is reviewed briefly below, especially as it pertains to aspirin and other salicylates, and is discussed in further detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Pharmacology and mechanism of action&quot;, section on 'Cyclooxygenase inhibition'</a>.)</p><p>PGH2 synthase is a bifunctional enzyme with two adjacent but spatially distinct active sites for peroxidase and COX activities. The COX active site is created by a long hydrophobic channel that is the site of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and nonsalicylate NSAID binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-mechanism-of-action-major-toxicities-and-use-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Mammalian cells contain two related but unique isozymes of COX: PG endoperoxide H2 synthase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2, respectively). Both catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2, leading to the production of biologically active PGs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66146\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66146 \">figure 1</a>). Both are sensitive to aspirin and nonselective nonsalicylate NSAIDs.</p><p>The COX isoforms differ in cellular location and relative inhibition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>COX-1 is a constitutive isozyme found in most tissues, where it is involved in producing PGs that regulate cellular housekeeping functions such as gastric cytoprotection, vascular homeostasis, platelet aggregation, and kidney function. By comparison, COX-2 is preferentially, if not exclusively, expressed in inflamed tissue or following exposure to growth factors, cytokines, or other mediators of inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> irreversibly inhibits both COX enzymes, preventing PG production by cells until new enzyme is produced. In COX-2, however, the efficiency by which serine 530 is trans-acetylated by aspirin, resulting in such inhibition, is at least 10-fold less than for COX-1. Thus, higher doses are required for an antiinflammatory effect than for an antithrombotic effect. Because arachidonic acid can be metabolized by either the COX or the lipoxygenase pathways, COX inhibition by aspirin and other NSAIDs may result in the increased synthesis of leukotriene (LT) products such as LTB4, LTC4, and LTD4.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gastrointestinal side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, caused by COX-1 inhibition, persist if aspirin is given in combination with selective COX-2 inhibitors. Thus, although use of a selective COX-2 inhibitor as an antiinflammatory agent otherwise results in less risk of gastroduodenal ulceration and hemorrhage, the incidence of such complications is similar to that observed with nonselective NSAIDS if the COX-2 selective NSAID is used concurrently with antithrombotic low-dose aspirin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-mechanism-of-action-major-toxicities-and-use-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Low doses have antithrombotic effects; intermediate doses have antipyretic and analgesic effects; and high doses have antiinflammatory effects comparable with other NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Effect of dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanisms of action by which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and the nonacetylated salicylates act include both cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent and -independent mechanisms. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Cyclooxygenase inhibition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Other proposed mechanisms of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and nonacetylated salicylates exhibit antiinflammatory activity and may be effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, low and moderate doses of aspirin and nonacetylated salicylates may be beneficial in osteoarthritis (OA). Aspirin is also used in giant cell arteritis and Kawasaki disease. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical use in rheumatic diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAIDs may interfere with the cardioprotective effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> by interference with aspirin binding to COX or due to their own effects upon cardiovascular risk. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Co-administration of salicylates with other NSAIDS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> include gastrointestinal toxicity (NSAID gastropathy), anticoagulant effects, Reye syndrome, and effects on pregnancy, renal function, and both allergic and pseudoallergic reactions. Salicylate toxicity may occur when higher salicylate levels are achieved.
