Adverse reactions occur predominantly in association with <strong>intravenous</strong> administration of RCM, but may also occur with intraarterial and nonvascular injections (eg, retrograde pyelography, intraarticular injections) of RCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic review discusses immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IHRs) to RCM, including their clinical presentation, epidemiology and risk factors, diagnosis, and management.

The epidemiologic association between seafood allergy and RCM reactions has been attributed to a common iodine allergy, since there is high iodine content in seafood. However, iodine and iodide are small molecules that do not cause anaphylactic reactions and are structurally unrelated to shellfish allergens (which are tropomyosin proteins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. A possible explanation for the association is that seafood is a common cause of food allergy in adults, and individuals with any atopic condition may be at higher risk for RCM reactions, as reviewed above, but there is no additional risk beyond that.</p><p>Another source of confusion is the patient with contact dermatitis in response to the skin disinfectant povidone-iodine.
