Risks and benefits should be discussed with both the parents and&nbsp;child before initiating treatment. SSRIs have been associated with psychiatric adverse events, such as disinhibition, agitation, and worsening of anxiety symptoms. Physical side effects most commonly include headaches, gastric distress, and sleep disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Antidepressant medications are associated with an increased risk of suicidality in children, which we address below.

After a week during which the patient is known to be taking the medication and tolerating it with minimal side effects, the dose can be increased incrementally to an initial therapeutic dose. If symptoms do not remit after six to eight weeks, the dose is increased incrementally and tested, until the maximum dose is reached or side effects are not tolerable. Antidepressants often require dosages similar to those in adults, due to the fast metabolism seen in children. A table summarizes initial daily doses, therapeutic ranges, and suggested dose titration rates for SSRIs in anxiety disorders in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F99025\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99025 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sertraline</a> can be started at an initial dose of 12.5 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for a minimum of seven days and titrated up to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in increments of 12.5 mg (child) or 25 to 50 mg (adolescent) per week. If an adequate clinical response is not seen after six to eight weeks of treatment, subsequent trials should be tried following dose increases of 12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for children and 25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for adolescents to a maximum of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p>When stopping an SSRI, decrease the dose gradually to avoid discontinuation symptoms, eg, by 25 to 50 percent weekly. During the tapering period, the treating clinician should carefully monitor the child or adolescent for adverse events.</p><p>Following reports of associations between antidepressant use and suicidality in children, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made recommendations regarding clinical monitoring and duration of the medications, below.

The US Food and Drug Administration issued a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; warning in 2004, stating that children and adolescents taking antidepressant medication, including SSRIs and TCAs, are at increased risk for suicidal thinking or behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Antidepressant risks and the <span class=\"nowrap\">evaluation/management</span> of suicidality in children are discussed in more detail separately.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 39 medication trials conducted in children and adolescents treated with an SSRIs, SNRIs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nefazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nefazodone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">venlafaxine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> for an anxiety disorder (including obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD] under DSM-IV) showed a small increase in the risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts compared with those assigned to placebo (0.5 percent for OCD; 0.7 percent for anxiety disorders other than OCD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The number needed to harm was 200 for OCD and 143 for non-OCD anxiety disorders. There were no completed suicides reported in the trials studied. The meta-analysis indicated good efficacy for the antidepressants in the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders, with a number-needed-to-treat of six for OCD and three for non-OCD anxiety disorders. Youth with OCD were 33 times more likely to benefit from antidepressant treatment than to experience a suicidal event. For youth with anxiety disorders other than OCD, treatment benefit was 47 times more likely than a suicidal event.</p><p>Another meta-analysis evaluated the suicidality of nine antidepressants in a total of 24 randomized controlled trials of children with pediatric anxiety disorders, depression, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The risk ratio (RR) of suicidality across trials was RR = 1.95, 95% CI, 1.28-2.98 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

A time period when the child has lower stress (eg, school vacation) is recommended for the trial. The medication should be resumed if the patient experiences a relapse of symptoms after the medication has been stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311492\"><span class=\"h1\">BENZODIAZEPINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines have a limited role in the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders.
