The epidemiology, mechanisms, and ophthalmologic aspects of abusive head injury in children, management of suspected child abuse, and the initial evaluation of severe traumatic brain injury in children are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Epidemiology, mechanisms, and types of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Eye findings in children with abusive head trauma (AHT)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe traumatic brain injury in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H558133986\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 40 percent of deaths from child abuse occur among children younger than 12 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Abusive head injury is the most common cause of death as the result of child physical abuse. Infants frequently present with nonspecific clinical features without a history of trauma. As a result, as many as 30 percent of children with abusive head injury may be misdiagnosed at the initial evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Identification of abusive head injury can be life-saving. In one chart review describing missed cases of abusive head injury, four of five deaths might have been prevented if the inflicted mechanism had been recognized during previous evaluations for symptoms related to head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Cranial injury may be inflicted by blunt force trauma, shaking, or a combination of forces. The constellation of injuries associated with this mechanism has been referred to as the &quot;shaken baby syndrome&quot; (SBS), the &quot;infant whiplash syndrome&quot;, the <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;shaken/impact</span> syndrome&quot;, or more simply, as &quot;inflicted or abusive head trauma&quot;. For many young infants, crying may be a trigger for the shaking episode, suggesting that the caretakers' response to prolonged crying may be an effective target for prevention strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p>The significance of the diagnosis (with regard to morbidity, child protection, and criminal prosecution) may be similar, regardless of whether injury resulted from direct blows or from shaking. In addition, much of the evidence to support the mechanism of injuries that result from shaking is retrospective and indirect (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Epidemiology, mechanisms, and types of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of injury'</a>). Some experts have suggested that the term &quot;shaken baby syndrome&quot; be replaced with a more generic term such as &quot;abusive head injury&quot; or &quot;inflicted neurotrauma&quot;, allowing for consideration of multiple mechanisms of injury in any child. Generic terms, such as &quot;head injury&quot;, also serve to distinguish the diagnosis of injury from the investigation of how the injury occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of abusive head injury are often nonspecific. Furthermore, a history of trauma usually is not forthcoming and external signs of injury (such as bruising of the skin) may be minimal or absent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms for which caregivers most often seek medical attention for children with abusive head injury include seizures, breathing difficulty, apnea, and lifelessness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-16</a>]. In comparison, in a population-based series describing the clinical features of children with inflicted and unintentional head injury, reasons for seeking care for those with unintentional head injury included local swelling following injury, parental concern for children who were asymptomatic, and lethargy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>No history of a traumatic event was offered in 64 to 97 percent of cases of abusive head injury described in several retrospective series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/11,12,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,17,18</a>]. In one of these reports, the absence of a history of trauma had a high specificity (0.97 [95% Cl 0.83-1.0]) and high positive predictive value (0.92 [95% Cl 0.78-0.98]) for abusive head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Other historical features that are typical include attributing the injuries to resuscitative efforts and a changing or developmentally incompatible history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Accurately determining when an injury occurred can be difficult, since the traumatic event is infrequently disclosed and initial symptoms may be nonspecific. However, a retrospective review describing cases where perpetrators admitted to abuse noted that 91 percent of children developed symptoms immediately after the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Perpetrators who have confessed to shaking infants often report multiple episodes of shaking over weeks to month prior to presentation, which may also influence determination of injury timing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Finally, a history of previous abuse <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> investigation for maltreatment is common among children who have sustained abusive head injury. Retrospective series have reported that over 60 percent of victims of abusive head injury may have a history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical evidence of previous abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with abusive head injury may have physical findings ranging from a normal neurologic examination, to nonspecific signs related to brain injury (such as vomiting and altered mental status), to coma and profoundly unstable vital signs (apnea, bradycardia) requiring resuscitation. This is illustrated in the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two retrospective series reported that occult head injury was diagnosed on screening neuroimaging studies in 37 and 29 percent of children being evaluated for child abuse who had no neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective series describing infants who were evaluated for complaints that were not initially recognized as the result of abusive head trauma, 65 percent were described as irritable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Many children have no external signs of injury (35 and 40 percent in two reports) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Retinal hemorrhages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinal hemorrhages are frequently noted in children with abusive head injury (60 to 85 percent in retrospective series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10,11,16,18,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,16,18,24</a>]. The extent of retinal hemorrhages is generally correlated with the severity of intracranial injury and neurologic impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Among abused neurologically normal children whose intracranial injuries were diagnosed with screening neuroimaging, retinal hemorrhages were uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>Although retinal hemorrhages have been reported in other conditions, those associated with abusive head injury are characteristically numerous, involve multiple layers of the retina, and extend beyond the posterior pole to the peripheral retina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69754\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69754 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>] (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). Injury to the eye as the result on abusive head injury is discussed separately.

Suspicious bruising patterns such as linear marks or bruises involving the ear, neck or torso in infants and young children also raise concern for inflicted injury among children with a nonspecific presentation.

Bruising in non-ambulatory infants is rare, and any bruise to a young infant should raise concerns of either trauma or a bleeding diathesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with abusive head injury frequently have injuries to other organ systems that are typically associated with abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In two retrospective series, 22 and 23 percent of children with abusive head injury also had rib fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Long bone fractures were reported in 23 and 29 percent of cases. In one of the reports, 4 percent of children sustained an abdominal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Cervical spinal injury may be more common in children with fatal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Injury to the cervical spine as the result of abusive head injury is uncommonly recognized clinically but may be more common than reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective study that documented the results of spinal MRI in 78 children sustaining abusive injury, 46 children with accidental injury, and 70 children with non-traumatic conditions, evidence of cervical spine ligamentous injury was found in 78 percent of abused patients compared with 46 percent of those with accidental injury and 1 percent of patients with non-traumatic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging of the entire spine is the best method for detecting these injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of abusive head injury requires a high index of suspicion.

Although children who present with serious head injury usually can be readily identified, subtle injuries may be missed.

As an example, multicenter, prospective validation of a point of care test that measured matrix metallopeptidase-p, neuron-specific enolase, vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1, and hemoglobin in the serum of 599 patients (12 percent with acute intracranial hemorrhage) had a sensitivity of 89 percent and a specificity of 48 percent at a specified cutoff identified during derivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

CT is readily available and reliably identifies injuries that require immediate intervention. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, large extra-axial hemorrhage (eg, subdural or epidural hemorrhage), and mass effect are best demonstrated on CT. Other injuries that are frequently identified include cerebral ischemia, cerebral contusion, skull fracture, and scalp hematoma. However, early signs of brain edema or diffuse axonal injury may not be apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>].

These descriptions of collections should not be used to date injury, as mixed collections can represent acute injury (eg, representing mixing of blood and CSF) or both acute and chronic bleeding. MRI allows for better estimation of the ages of intracranial blood products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

As an example, in an observational study of 386 children managed with abusive head trauma at multiple children&rsquo;s hospitals, fatal outcomes were significantly associated by adjusted analysis with an initial Glasgow coma score of 3, 4, or 5; retinal hemorrhage; intraparenchymal hemorrhage; or cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. </p><p>Among survivors, the initial morbidity from abusive head injury is significant. In one retrospective chart review of 364 cases, death occurred in 19 percent as a direct result of the head injury; among survivors, 55 percent had persistent neurologic deficit and 65 percent had visual impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Only 22 percent of the survivors were felt to be &quot;well&quot; at the time of discharge, without identified health or developmental impairment.</p><p>Follow-up studies of children with abusive head injury suggest that, although some patients may initially improve, long-term neurocognitive functioning is poor. This is illustrated in the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among a group of 13 patients with nonaccidental head injury who were followed over a period of 4 to 14 years (mean seven years, two months), six children initially appeared to have a full recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. By the end of the study, 11 of the 12 survivors had been diagnosed with abnormalities ranging from psychomotor delay, intellectual disability (mental retardation), and learning disabilities to blindness, seizures, tetraplegia, and hemiparesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report, 25 children with abusive head injury were followed for a mean of 59 months with neurologic, behavioral, and social assessments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Among these children, 68 percent had abnormalities noted on follow-up, 36 percent of which were classified as severe. Identified abnormalities included motor (60 percent), visual (48 percent), speech and language impairment (64 percent), and epilepsy (20 percent). Behavioral disturbances were noted in 52 percent of children. Many of the behavioral problems developed in the second and third year of life. Outcomes correlated with severity of injury, but not with age at injury or mechanism of injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational study of 39 surviving patients found that 17 had normal development, 17 had mild to moderate developmental delay, and 5 had severe impairment. Cerebral ischemia on initial head CT or MRI was associated with long-term impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p>Radiologic sequelae of shaking injury include infarction, cerebral atrophy (generalized or asymmetric), encephalomalacia, hydrocephalus, and chronic subdural hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/48,85-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,85-87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The implementation of strategies for the prevention of abusive head injury is recommended by the AAP Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Nevertheless, the development of effective strategies is a challenge. Several types of programs have been studied.</p><p>Primary prevention efforts, which target a broad population, have included large scale public education campaigns and hospital-based education programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>]. However, based upon two studies, broad-based applications of such interventions have <strong>not</strong> been associated with corresponding decreases in hospitalizations for abusive head trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>]. </p><p>Secondary prevention programs, directed toward a specific subset of the population at risk for child maltreatment, have demonstrated some success. In one study, prenatal and early childhood home visitation significantly reduced the number of verified reports of child abuse and neglect in the group that received the intervention compared with the group that did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. However, the effectiveness of this type of program in preventing abusive head injury has not been specifically studied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abusive head injury is a common cause of death, particularly among children younger than 12 months of age. The diagnosis is often missed at the initial evaluation because clinical features are typically nonspecific and there is frequently no history provided of trauma. As a result, the child may not receive prompt treatment for the current injury and is at risk for later, potentially fatal, injuries. (See <a href=\"#H558133986\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is common for there to be no history of trauma provided by caregivers among children who have sustained an abusive head injury. As many as 60 percent of children have been previously physically abused. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neurologic examination is abnormal for most children with abusive head injury, although some may be asymptomatic. Retinal hemorrhages are common (though not pathognomonic) and correlate with the severity of injury. Some, but not all, children have cutaneous bruising, particularly around the face. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evaluation should include CBC with differential, platelet count, and coagulation studies. In children with suspected abuse, laboratory testing for occult abdominal injury is also recommended, including liver function enzymes, amylase, lipase and a urinalysis. When meningitis is a serious consideration, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should generally be obtained if a lumbar puncture can be safely performed, primarily to exclude infection as a cause for nonspecific symptoms. CSF is typically xanthochromic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bloody in children with abusive head trauma. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that computed tomography (CT) and a skeletal survey be performed initially for all symptomatic children with suspected abusive head injury. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides additional information regarding the extent and timing of injuries, and may be preferable to CT in the asymptomatic child if such imaging and interpretation by a pediatric neuroradiologist are readily available. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of abusive head trauma is aided by the presence of additional clinical features in children with intracranial injury including a history that is inconsistent with physical findings, retinal hemorrhages, fractures, unexplained bruises, apnea, and seizures. A thorough evaluation by a multidisciplinary team should be performed whenever there is suspicion that an injury is inflicted. Subsequent investigation by social service and law enforcement agencies may substantiate the diagnosis of abusive head injury. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abusive head injury must be differentiated from unintentional injury. Other diagnoses that must be excluded include birth trauma, bleeding disorders, and other rare conditions such as glutaric aciduria type 1 and other metabolic diseases. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial management must address the safety of other children in the home as well as the medical condition of the injured child. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The morbidity and mortality for abusive head injury is significant. Mortality rates as high as 23 percent have been reported. The majority of surviving children have permanent neurologic impairment. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of successful prevention programs has been a challenge. In one report, a short, intensive education program describing the dangers of violent infant shaking and providing alternative responses to persistent infant crying administered to parents of newborns before hospital discharge appeared to be effective. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690423399\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Erin Endom, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Administration for Children &amp; Families.
