According to some reports, children have engaged in strangulation activities for generations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-choking-game-and-other-strangulation-activities-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,11</a>]; however, the first reference to the &quot;choking game&quot; in the medical literature occurred in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-choking-game-and-other-strangulation-activities-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>There is little information about how many children and adolescents engage in strangulation activities. Engaging in such activities typically comes to light only when complications occur; however, the specific attribution of complications to strangulation activities is likely to be underreported because death certificates lack the detail necessary to distinguish death related to strangulation activities from other causes of unintentional strangulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-choking-game-and-other-strangulation-activities-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,9</a>].</p><p>In a 2015 systematic review of 17 cross-sectional studies, the median lifetime prevalence of participation in strangulation activities among survey respondents (predominantly 12 to 17 years of age) was 7.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-choking-game-and-other-strangulation-activities-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Prevalence ranged geographically, ranging from 6 to 16 percent in France, 5 to 7 percent in Canada, and 4 to 17 percent in the United States. Survey respondents indicated that they first participated between the ages of 8 and 15 years.</p><p>Between 11 and 23 percent of those who participated did so without others present. Solitary participation in strangulation activities has been associated with higher rates of suicidality and poor mental health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-choking-game-and-other-strangulation-activities-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It also increases the risk of death. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> below.)</p><p>In the United States, many states have reported a significant increase in reported cases. Whether there has been an actual change in the number of children engaging in strangulation activities over time, however, is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-choking-game-and-other-strangulation-activities-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Changes in the numbers of deaths related to the &quot;choking game&quot; reported in the media may be related to changes in the news media's level of interest, changes in &quot;choking game&quot; activity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changes in awareness of the &quot;choking game&quot; by emergency and health care providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-choking-game-and-other-strangulation-activities-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Predisposing factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not clear what motivates children to engage in strangulation activities.

In others, engaging in strangulation activities may be &quot;practicing&quot; strangulation as a potential method of suicide.</p><p>Surveys of teenagers indicate that participation in strangulation activities may be associated with other risky behaviors (such as substance use, risky sexual activity, poor dietary behaviors, engagement in risky sports) and poor mental health (eg, suicidality) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-choking-game-and-other-strangulation-activities-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23,24</a>].

Children and adolescents may be more careful about engaging in a strangulation activity than they would be about playing a game.</p><p>We recommend that children and adolescents receive education regarding the dangers of strangulation activities, emphasizing that there is no way to safeguard against serious complications or death. The effectiveness of educational interventions to prevent or reduce participation in strangulation activities has not been well studied. However, counseling interventions have been demonstrated to prevent or reduce other behaviors with health risks (eg, tobacco use during pregnancy, risky sexual behavior) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-choking-game-and-other-strangulation-activities-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].

Failure to release pressure before loss of consciousness can result in serious neurologic injury or death, particularly when strangulation activity is performed alone. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'The &quot;choking game&quot;'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deaths resulting from strangulation activities are most common in teenage boys (median age 13 years) who engage in the activity alone. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of consciousness may occur within seconds of strangulation, and death may occur within minutes. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral hypoxia and hypoperfusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presenting complaints of children with less severe episodes of hypoxia whose findings ultimately are attributed to self-induced hypoxia may include confusional episodes, seizure-like events, syncope, paroxysmal episodes of altered awareness, acute visual loss, and neurologic injury. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When considering strangulation activities as the precipitant of asphyxia-related complications, it is critical to take a careful history; it may be necessary to interview siblings, friends, and other associates of the patient. Video-electroencephalographic monitoring may be useful in patients with paroxysmal episodes. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children and adolescents who are found unconscious may require aggressive resuscitation and treatment of postanoxic brain injury.
