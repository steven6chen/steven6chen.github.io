In one study comparing the persistence of cellular and humoral immunity to mumps virus in 50 individuals who had follow-up more than 20 years after receiving two MMR vaccinations during early childhood with a control group who had a history of naturally acquired immunity to mumps, levels of detectable anti-mumps virus immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies were lower in the vaccinated group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-mumps-and-rubella-immunization-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, mumps antigen-specific lymphoproliferative responses were detected in 98 percent of all subjects, consistent with long persistence of cellular immunity. Other studies have noted that cellular immune responses to the mumps virus can be identified in the majority of vaccinated individuals, regardless of antibody status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-mumps-and-rubella-immunization-in-adults/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A third dose of MMR vaccine may be useful to limit transmission of mumps in outbreak settings that occur in high-density, close-contact settings, given the possibility of two-dose mumps vaccine failure due to waning of vaccine-induced immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-mumps-and-rubella-immunization-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In one mumps outbreak during which 1755 students (80 percent of students in grades 6 to 12) received a third dose of MMR vaccine, mumps attack rates declined from 4.9 percent (three weeks before vaccination) to 0.13 percent (three weeks after vaccination) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-mumps-and-rubella-immunization-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rubella &ndash; One dose of vaccine produces a rubella seroconversion rate of about 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-mumps-and-rubella-immunization-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].
