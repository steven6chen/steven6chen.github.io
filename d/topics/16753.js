Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is probably the same or similar disease when it begins in patients &ge;16 years of age. sJIA is classified as a subset of JIA, but the pathophysiology is most consistent with an autoinflammatory disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-juvenile-arthritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of juvenile arthritis&quot;, section on 'Systemic arthritis'</a>.)</p><p>The treatment options for sJIA are discussed in this review. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, complications, and prognosis of sJIA are discussed separately, as are other subtypes of JIA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Course, prognosis, and complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-juvenile-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of juvenile arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone are effective for some children with sJIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Glucocorticoids along with the disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, were traditionally used in patients who failed NSAID therapy. However, glucocorticoids are a poor long-term therapeutic option because of associated toxicity, and methotrexate often does not change the aggressive and often permanently disabling consequences of unremitting disease. Biologic DMARDs, such as interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6 inhibitors, were initially reserved for patients refractory to conventional therapy (NSAIDs followed by the addition of glucocorticoids with or without methotrexate). However, they are increasingly the agent of choice after failure of NSAID therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sJIA since they are highly effective.</p><p>Treatment guidelines, based upon presence or absence of active systemic features, clinician global assessment, active joint count, and presence or absence of features concerning for macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), are outlined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These guidelines emphasize the earlier use of biologics in children with sJIA, although specific information on appropriate dose is lacking. Another set of standardized treatment plans was developed through a consensus process by the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) based upon the most commonly used treatment approaches for systemic JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H488284223\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our general approach is reviewed here, and the specific agents are discussed in greater detail below, including dosing and withdrawal of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H488283367\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of initial therapy depends upon the severity of the presentation, including whether the patient shows signs of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).

Any NSAID other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is suitable and is given at standard anti-inflammatory doses. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications#H40787333\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Course, prognosis, and complications&quot;, section on 'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>In general, a trial of NSAIDs alone should last no more than a few weeks, since it is usually apparent whether an additional agent is needed within two to four weeks. Additional therapy is indicated in children who develop or continue to have significant symptoms despite use of NSAIDs. The approach for patients who have not responded to a trial of an NSAID alone during the acute phase of the illness is similar to that for patients who present with moderate-to-severe disease. (See <a href=\"#H488283554\" class=\"local\">'Moderate-to-severe disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H488283554\"><span class=\"h3\">Moderate-to-severe disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients whose initial symptoms include high fevers, other systemic manifestations including serositis and possible early MAS, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> moderate-to-severe polyarthritis, we suggest adding one of the biologic agents that inhibit interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6, such as anakinra, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>, rather than the nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. NSAIDs can be continued in conjunction with other agents if needed for pain control. (See <a href=\"#H3029185\" class=\"local\">'Interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12929866\" class=\"local\">'Interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p>Historically, many pediatric rheumatologists have used glucocorticoids in this situation, using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> as a steroid-sparing agent, since glucocorticoids provide rapid onset of action and almost uniform efficacy for severely ill children. However, the biologic agents that block the effects of IL-1 and IL-6 are more effective than nonbiologic DMARDs (eg, methotrexate) and have more favorable side-effect profiles than long-term use of glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H15847756\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H488284610\" class=\"local\">'Methotrexate'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15849649\" class=\"local\">'Biologic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients may still need to be started on glucocorticoids along with an anti-IL-1 or IL-6 agent, depending upon the seriousness or life-threatening nature of the symptoms. In particular, many pediatric rheumatologists would include glucocorticoids as part of initial therapy when early MAS is suspected since monotherapy with anti-IL-1 or IL-6 agents may be insufficient in this setting. Concomitant use of a biologic agent may allow relatively rapid tapering of glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H488283388\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications#H40787333\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Course, prognosis, and complications&quot;, section on 'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H488283388\"><span class=\"h2\">Refractory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who were started on a biologic agent as part of the initial therapy, we suggest adding a glucocorticoid within a week if there is continued polyarthritis, fever, and rash. We would add a glucocorticoid sooner if there was evidence of MAS or severe serositis. Both drugs are typically continued until disease control is established. The clinician may then decide to gradually withdraw the glucocorticoid first because of the inevitable toxicity associated with its chronic use. Withdrawal of the biologic agent may be attempted as well if the patient continues to exhibit no sign of disease, since the patient may have monophasic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Evidence suggests that there is a window of opportunity, and the early use of anti-IL-1 agents may change the course of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 agents have shown good efficacy and allowed tapering of glucocorticoids in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Inhibitors of IL-1 and IL-6 appear to be the most effective of the biologic agents for primarily systemic disease (eg, fever, rash, and serositis) and may be effective for chronic arthritis as well. Although inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and blockers of T-cell costimulation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a>) are not recommended for initial therapy or systemic disease, these agents, as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, can be helpful adjuncts for chronic arthritis therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>]. Other nonbiologic DMARDs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, and cytotoxic drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, are options in patients who fail standard therapy, including biologic agents.

Although the traditional NSAID of first choice was <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, it is no longer commonly used because of dosing and toxicity issues, which warrant frequent salicylate level and liver function test monitoring. None of these NSAIDs have shown any unique advantages for children with sJIA, except possibly for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>, which is anecdotally effective for control of recalcitrant fever.</p><p>If NSAID therapy alone is effective in controlling all of the sJIA manifestations, a trial of gradually tapering the NSAID can be attempted after a period of several months of disease quiescence to see if the patient has gone into remission.</p><p>Use of any of the NSAIDs is associated with a risk of hepatotoxicity, often manifested by hepatic enzyme elevation. Rare cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], but these findings may have been secondary to subclinical macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which was not a recognized entity of sJIA at the time of those reports. NSAIDs are also associated with renal toxicity, usually manifested as tubular interstitial disease with microscopic urine analysis changes, although patients can also develop edema, papillary necrosis, and hypertension.

Glucocorticoids should be used judiciously in sJIA to minimize their toxicity. They are typically used during the acute phase of the illness to preserve the ability to carry out activities of daily living, particularly in children who have not responded quickly to initial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H488283388\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Every effort must be made to minimize the dose and duration of therapy. Whenever possible, the dose of glucocorticoids should be kept below 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (or its equivalent), and the duration of therapy should be less than six months. A disease-modifying agent more appropriate for long-term management (eg, a biologic agent or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>) should be initiated soon after the child is stabilized in order to facilitate the timely withdrawal of glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H488284610\" class=\"local\">'Methotrexate'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3029185\" class=\"local\">'Interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12929866\" class=\"local\">'Interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p>Some clinicians use intermittent high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids to reduce the toxicity associated with daily oral glucocorticoids or to treat severe anemia or pericarditis. The combination of glucocorticoids and NSAIDs can result in an increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity due to their additive effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15849649\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>sJIA is associated with increased circulating levels of multiple cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Experimental evidence supports the use of monoclonal antibodies or soluble receptors to block inflammatory cytokines in patients with sJIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/18-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-25</a>]. Of these, the most efficacious biologic agents, based upon results from randomized trials, are those that block IL-1 or IL-6. Many pediatric rheumatologists use one of these agents, rather than a glucocorticoid, in patients who have failed NSAID monotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of biologic agents and kinase inhibitors in the rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients receiving biologic response modifiers have an increased risk of infection, particularly mycobacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Thus, the American Academy of Pediatrics has published guidance for clinicians using these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A thorough history&nbsp;is&nbsp;recommended to&nbsp;help determine infectious risk,&nbsp;with performance of&nbsp;screening tests&nbsp;as indicated depending upon the history and biologic agent chosen. If treatment can be safely delayed, administration of routine immunizations at least two weeks prior to starting a biologic agent is advised for inactivated or subunit vaccines and at least four weeks prior for live vaccines. Unfortunately, delaying treatment while awaiting vaccination is not feasible or safe for many children presenting with active sJIA. Administration of live vaccines is not recommended during treatment with biologic agents. An infectious disease specialist should be consulted if a live vaccine is deemed necessary while a patient is on biologic therapy. Inactivated and subunit vaccines can be given while on therapy, and an annual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> is recommended.</p><p>There are little published data regarding withdrawal of biologic agents in children with sJIA, and no guidelines exist, although tapering and withdrawal was successful in some patients who achieved inactive disease in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and in an observational series of patients treated with anakinra at disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most pediatric rheumatologists gradually increase the dosing interval until they feel it is safe to stop therapy in children who appear to be in remission (on drug) for six months.</p><p>The appropriate role of the various biologic agents, especially the IL-6 and IL-1 inhibitors, in the treatment of children with sJIA should become clearer as pediatric rheumatologists gain experience with these agents and their comparative effectiveness is studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These biologics are effective for most children with this disease, but further study is needed regarding which should be given in what situation and for what patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3029185\"><span class=\"h3\">Interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IL-1 is one of the predominant proinflammatory cytokines underlying the inflammatory symptoms of sJIA. Thus, IL-1 inhibitors such as anakinra (recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rilonacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rilonacept</a> (IL-1 trap) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a> (anti-IL-1-beta monoclonal antibody) are beneficial in many children with sJIA. The IL-1 inhibitors, anakinra, rilonacept, and canakinumab, are administered by subcutaneous injection. Canakinumab is administered monthly and rilonacept weekly, whereas anakinra is administered daily. However, the anakinra dose can be adjusted more readily or withdrawn more quickly if the patient does not respond, because of its short half-life. This is a potential advantage, especially early on in the course, when the disease is often unstable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12929729\"><span class=\"h4\">Anakinra</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The central role of IL-1 in sJIA and the clinical outcome of treatment with anakinra were documented in an early study of nine patients with sJIA resistant to other therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum from patients with sJIA upregulated the expression of genes from the IL-1 <span class=\"nowrap\">cytokine/cytokine</span> receptor family and induced high levels of IL-1-beta production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All nine patients became afebrile within the first week of anakinra therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eight patients had active arthritis at the start of therapy.

One international group gathered 46 patients who had received anakinra as part of initial therapy for sJIA, including 10 treated with anakinra without glucocorticoids or other DMARDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Many patients were able to avoid glucocorticoid therapy altogether, and chronic arthritis did not develop in almost 90 percent of these patients followed for more than six months (compared with 30 to 50 percent among historical controls). Results from a subsequent prospective case series are consistent with the previous study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/4,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,34</a>].</p><p>The optimal dosing of anakinra remains undefined. In one series, over 40 percent of children treated with less than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> required dose escalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Accordingly, careful monitoring for MAS after initiation of any therapy for sJIA is essential. Patients with sJIA are predisposed to developing MAS and may display features of MAS throughout their disease course, with some patients having evidence of &quot;chronic MAS&quot; that is refractory to treatment and carries a poor prognosis.

In general, a trial of NSAIDs alone should last no more than four weeks. An additional agent should be added in children who develop or continue to have significant symptoms despite use of NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"#H488283417\" class=\"local\">'Mild-to-moderate disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Historically, most pediatric rheumatologists have added a glucocorticoid in patients who have not responded to a trial of an NSAID alone or who have severe disease on initial presentation. However, long-term use of glucocorticoids is associated with a high frequency of side effects. In addition, biologic agents, especially the interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 inhibitors, are effective in reducing clinical symptoms in patients with disease refractory to NSAID and glucocorticoid therapy. More limited data suggest that they are also beneficial when used early in the care of children with severe sJIA (ie, instead of glucocorticoids) once the diagnosis is confirmed. The decision to initiate therapy with a biologic agent first and the choice of biologic agent must be made by the individual treating clinician after discussion of the risks and benefits with the patient and family. (See <a href=\"#H488283554\" class=\"local\">'Moderate-to-severe disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15847756\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15849649\" class=\"local\">'Biologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have not responded to a trial of an NSAID alone, or whose initial symptoms include high fevers, other severe systemic symptoms, and painful polyarthritis, we suggest adding one of the biologic agents, such as anakinra, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>, rather than glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The advantage of the anti-IL-1 agents, anakinra and canakinumab, is that they are administered by periodic subcutaneous injection, while the anti-IL-6 agent, tocilizumab, is administered intravenously. Anakinra is initially prescribed at a dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily (up to 100 mg). Canakinumab is usually given as 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> monthly in children less than 40 kg, but the full vial of 150 mg is given to children over 40 kg. Tocilizumab is typically given monthly at a dose of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for children who weigh less than 30 kg and 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for those who weigh more. (See <a href=\"#H488283554\" class=\"local\">'Moderate-to-severe disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3029185\" class=\"local\">'Interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12929866\" class=\"local\">'Interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest adding a glucocorticoid if there is not a prompt response to a biologic agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). While the definition of a prompt response will differ from center to center, few pediatric rheumatologists would wait more than a week before adding a glucocorticoid in the face of continued polyarthritis, fever, and rash, and all would add a glucocorticoid sooner if there was evidence of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or severe serositis. Both the glucocorticoid and the biologic agent are usually continued until disease control is established. Both drugs are typically continued until disease control is established. The clinician may then decide to gradually withdraw the glucocorticoid first because of the inevitable toxicity associated with its chronic use. Withdrawal of the biologic agent may be attempted as well if the patient continues to exhibit no sign of disease. The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose should be limited to 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> if possible, although doses as high as 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> or pulsed high-dose therapy, may be required in severe cases. (See <a href=\"#H488283388\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15847756\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to treating patients with a polyphasic disease course and recurrent episodes is the same as for initial therapy.

Inhibitors of IL-1 and IL-6 appear to be the most effective of the biologic agents for primarily systemic disease and may be effective for chronic arthritis as well. Inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, blockers of T-cell costimulation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a>), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> can be helpful adjuncts for chronic arthritis therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>]. Other nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, and cytotoxic drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, are additional options in patients who fail standard therapy, including biologic agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential toxicities of the drugs used to treat sJIA, including drug-induced MAS, must be carefully balanced against the aggressive and often permanently disabling nature of unremitting disease.
