This well-recognized syndrome is characterized by variable airflow limitation and by airway hyperresponsiveness, which represents an exaggerated contractile response of the airways to a variety of stimuli.</p><p>Atopy, or the genetic predisposition to develop specific IgE antibodies directed against common environmental allergens, is the strongest identifiable risk factor for the development of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While the association of asthma and atopy is undisputed, the pathways by which atopy is expressed as clinical asthma and by which asthma occurs in the absence of atopy are not as clearly defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Intrinsic abnormalities in airway smooth muscle function, airway remodeling in response to injury or inflammation, and interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells appear to modulate and add to the effects of airway inflammation in creating the clinical presentation of asthma. Different phenotypes of asthma that can be defined clinically reinforce the notion that asthma is really a syndrome with multiple underlying mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The inflammatory, physiologic, and structural factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma will be reviewed here, focusing on aspects that aid in the understanding of the clinical presentation of asthma and its treatment.</p><p>Discussions of the genetics, clinical risk factors (eg, atopy, allergen exposure, viral illness, gender, and smoking), diagnosis, and management of asthma are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of asthma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for asthma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initial evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AIRWAY INFLAMMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway biopsies obtained by bronchoscopy have demonstrated that inflammation in asthma generally involves the same cells that play prominent roles in the allergic response in the nasal passages and skin, whether the individual is atopic or not. This supports the belief that the consequences of mast cell activation, mediated by a variety of cells, cytokines, and other mediators, are key to the development of clinical asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-allergic-rhinitis-rhinosinusitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis (rhinosinusitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mast cell activation by allergen provides a good model for asthma and will be described in this section. Accumulated evidence suggests that the following sequence of events explains how inhalation of allergen leads to the early, or immediate, phase of airway inflammation, which is followed about six hours later by a late phase reaction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial allergen exposure is followed by elaboration of specific IgE antibodies. Regulation of specific IgE production appears related to an overexpression of Th2 type T cell responses relative to the Th1 type; this overexpression is likely due to a combination of genetic and environmental influences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After allergen specific IgE antibodies are synthesized and secreted by plasma cells, they bind to high-affinity receptors on mast cells (and basophils). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-biology-of-ige\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The biology of IgE&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When an allergen is subsequently inhaled and comes into contact with mucosal mast cells, it cross links allergen-specific IgE antibodies on the mast cell surface; rapid degranulation and mediator release follow in a calcium dependent process. This is known as the early or immediate phase reaction, which is described in the next section. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cell-derived-mediators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cell-derived mediators&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Early and late phase reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In human studies of allergen bronchoprovocation, allergen inhalation by a sensitized individual leads to bronchoconstriction within several minutes. This is called the early response and correlates with the release of mast cell mediators during the immediate hypersensitivity reaction detailed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These mediators, including histamine, prostaglandin D2, and cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, D4, and E4), contract airway smooth muscle (ASM) directly, and may also stimulate reflex neural pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>This early phase reaction is sometimes followed by a late phase recurrence of bronchoconstriction several hours later. The late phase response coincides with an influx of inflammatory cells, including innate immune cells such as monocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, and cells associated with adaptive immunity such as T lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. The mediators released by these cells also cause ASM contraction that is largely reversible by beta-agonist administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the observation that beta-agonists do not completely reverse airflow obstruction caused by allergen inhalation is evidence that the late phase reaction is more complex than just ASM contraction.</p><p>The late phase response is characterized by recruitment of inflammatory and immune cells, particularly the eosinophil, basophil, neutrophil, and helper, memory T-cells to sites of allergen exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Monocytes and dendritic cells are also recruited to inflammatory sites and likely play important roles in mediating or modulating the response to allergen exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The roles of these various inflammatory cells are described in the next sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Eosinophils</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eosinophil is the most characteristic cell that accumulates in asthma and allergic inflammation; its presence is often related to disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Activated eosinophils produce lipid mediators, such as leukotrienes and platelet activating factor, that mediate smooth muscle contraction; toxic granule products (eg, major basic protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, eosinophil peroxidase, or eosinophil cationic protein) that can damage airway epithelium and nerves; and cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), transforming growth factors (TGF)-alpha and beta, and interleukins that may be involved in airway remodeling and fibrosis.</p><p>Eosinophils are recruited or activated by the hematopoietin interleukin 5 (IL-5), by the eotaxin family of chemokines via the eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor CCR3, and by Toll-like receptors (TLR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mast cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cells are increased in number in asthmatic airways and may be found in close association with airway smooth muscle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition to producing bronchoconstricting mediators (eg, histamine, certain prostaglandins, and leukotrienes), mast cells also store and release tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, which is important in the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells and in altered function and growth of ASM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].

Th2 lymphocytes also express the chemokine receptors (CCR4 and CCR8) and the chemoattractant receptor (CR)-like molecule (CRTH2), a receptor for prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), suggesting potential interactions between the mast cell and chemotactic signals that target eosinophils and Th2 cells and that sustain airway inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].

Mechanisms causing airflow limitation include contraction of airway smooth muscle, thickening of the airway wall due to edema or cellular components, plugging of airways with mucus or cellular debris, and airway remodeling. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Airway remodeling'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Smooth muscle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraction and relaxation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) accounts for much of the rapid changes in airflow limitation characterizing asthma and is the basis for beta-agonist therapy that directly relaxes ASM. Bronchoconstriction may be due to direct effects of contractile agonists released from inflammatory cells or reflex neural mechanisms. As an example, mast cell and eosinophil mediators, such as leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 and histamine, are potent bronchoconstrictors.</p><p>Airway inflammation occurs throughout the tracheobronchial tree; varying degrees of obstruction of different diameter airways may determine disease physiology. In theory, obstruction in large airways leads to airflow limitation and decreased flow rates, while obstruction in small airways (ie, diameter less than 2 mm) leads to airway closure at low lung volumes, air trapping with an increase in residual volume, and in many cases, dynamic hyperinflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Hyperinflation may compensate for airway narrowing by increasing the tethering forces of the lung parenchyma that oppose airway narrowing at increasing lung volumes, a phenomenon known as airway-parenchymal interdependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>If airway obstruction is widespread, dynamic hyperinflation is more likely to lead to increases in total lung capacity (TLC); less widespread obstruction is less likely to increase TLC, but may cause local areas of hyperinflation. Much of the chest tightness and discomfort of an asthma attack may be due to air trapping and breathing at higher lung volumes to maintain airway patency and sustain adequate ventilation.</p><p>The relative contributions of small and large airways to airflow obstruction have also been evaluated. Marked (sevenfold) increases in resistance in small airways have been documented in patients with mild asthma, despite normal spirometry; the small airways appear to be a key site of airway closure due to ASM contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/63,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,65</a>].</p><p>However, the notion that the small airways are the predominant site of airway narrowing in asthma has been challenged by imaging studies in patients with asthma. These studies suggest that even large airways can close with ASM contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Studies using high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in patients with asthma found heterogeneous narrowing of large airways often with recurring patterns of airway narrowing within individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. By hyperpolarized helium nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of asthmatic lungs, wedge-shaped ventilation defects were demonstrated consistent with narrowing or closure of segmental or subsegmental airways. The extent of these defects correlated with asthma severity and spirometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>Studies of bronchial thermoplasty, a technique that applies radiofrequency waves to the airways during bronchoscopy to decrease large airway smooth muscle mass, provide another line of evidence supporting a central role for ASM in large airways in the pathogenesis of asthma. Preliminary evidence suggests that reducing ASM mass by this technique improves asthma control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H601983207\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of severe asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Bronchial thermoplasty'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchial hyperresponsiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is another defining feature of asthma and is a manifestation of reversible airflow obstruction due to smooth muscle contraction. BHR represents an exaggerated constrictor response to a variety of physical, chemical, or environmental stimuli. BHR can be quantitated by the dose response to pharmacologic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> or histamine, causing a 20 percent fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>). While BHR is not specific for asthma, patients with asthma typically demonstrate BHR to much lower doses (eg, 10- to 100-fold) of these agents than normal or allergic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoprovocation-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoprovocation testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While ASM is clearly involved in BHR, the precise mechanism that causes ASM to become hyperresponsive is not known. Possible explanations for BHR include alterations in smooth muscle function or mass, loss of airway-parenchymal interdependence, loss of a bronchodilating effect of deep breaths, enhanced sensitivity of neural pathways leading to bronchoconstriction, and exaggerated airway narrowing from smooth muscle contraction as a consequence of remodeling and structural abnormalities of the airway.</p><p>Evidence that BHR in asthmatics is not due to altered ASM function or sensitivity, but rather to the breathing pattern in which the smooth muscle contracts, comes from studies that reproduce BHR in normal individuals simply by prohibiting deep breaths during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Under these conditions, the dose response to methacholine of normals was identical to that of asthmatics, indicating that the defect in asthma was loss of smooth muscle relaxation associated with deep inspiration. Acute airway narrowing in normal subjects could be demonstrated by HRCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Further, HRCT imaging of airways revealed equal bronchodilation in normals and asthmatics with deep inspiration. However, after airway constriction with methacholine, normal subjects maintained bronchodilation after a deep breath, while asthmatics constricted further [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>A possible clinical manifestation of the loss of bronchodilator effect from deep inspiration is the bronchoconstriction that occurs during exercise in patients with asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical correlation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BHR presents clinically with the sudden onset of shortness of breath following inhalation of irritants or cold air. Patients may describe the sensation that their airways feel &quot;twitchy&quot;, meaning that minor changes in the inhaled air can lead to need for their beta agonist inhaler. Beta agonists cause smooth muscle relaxation at least temporarily. This sensation of &quot;twitchiness&quot; may occur when airway inflammation is present and may be improved by allergen and irritant avoidance or treatment of inflammation with glucocorticoids. Better understanding of the physiology of this response may lead to better methods for treatment and prevention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">AIRWAY REMODELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While many patients have intermittent asthma symptoms and normal physiologic testing between asthma episodes, increasing evidence suggests that a subset of patients with asthma have irreversible airflow obstruction, which is believed to be caused by airway remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Airway remodeling refers to structural changes in the airways that may cause irreversible airflow limitation, superimposed on the effects of inflammation and smooth muscle contraction described above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51543\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51543 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histopathologic changes of airway remodeling include damage or loss of the normal pseudostratified structure of airway epithelium, an increase in the proportion of mucous-producing goblet cells, fibrotic thickening of the sub-epithelial reticular basement membrane or &quot;lamina reticularis&quot;, increased numbers of myofibroblasts, increased vascularity, increased airway smooth muscle mass, and increased extracellular matrix.</p><p>Such structural changes contribute to bronchial wall thickening, alterations in the physiologic consequences of smooth muscle contraction, or loss of airway-parenchymal interdependence (ie, the tethering forces exerted by the lung parenchyma that maintain airway patency). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Smooth muscle'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Contribution of airway remodeling to bronchial hyperresponsiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Structural narrowing of airways associated with remodeling appears to increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). This was examined in a study that correlated pulmonary function test parameters with the dimensions of small, medium, and large airways measured by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in 21 subjects with moderate or severe asthma (baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) was 64 percent of predicted) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Airway dimensions, measured at total lung capacity (TLC) and functional residual capacity (FRC), were analyzed for relationships to lung volumes at baseline and after intensive bronchodilator treatment. The change between findings at baseline and after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> was felt to reflect the effect of airway smooth muscle tone and structure, respectively. The following findings suggest that dynamic hyperinflation caused by narrowing of large airways (ie, remodeling) is a major determinant of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Baseline smooth muscle tone was associated with an increased residual volume (RV) that was threefold greater than the decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) due to a simultaneous increase in TLC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increase in RV correlated inversely with the relaxed luminal diameter of medium airways and directly with the wall thickness of large airways under conditions where smooth muscle tone was absent, not with the degree of smooth muscle tone or dimensions of small airways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased FVC was the major determinant of baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>. Whether or not TLC increased and FVC fell, was also dependent on the dimensions of relaxed large airways, with narrower large airways correlating with larger falls in FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub>.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical correlation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway remodeling is thought to be an early feature of asthma based on the description of sub-basement membrane thickening in the airways of children with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In adults, evidence for remodeling comes from the observation that many adults with asthma have an irreversible component to their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The general consensus is that patients with more severe and earlier onset asthma experience accelerated loss of lung function due to airway remodeling; however, the extent of progression and loss of lung function is highly variable.</p><p>Longitudinal studies have demonstrated progressive loss of lung function in subjects with asthma compared to normals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. However, other studies have suggested that this depends on the severity of asthma; patients with mild asthma were less likely to manifest airway <span class=\"nowrap\">remodeling/worsening</span> airflow limitation, whereas those with severe asthma were more likely to show evidence of airway remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. As an example, a study from Melbourne, Australia, that followed a large cohort of asthmatic and control subjects for 35 years, did not find accelerated average decline in lung function with asthma; however, those with severe asthma had progressive disease through childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Adults with low lung function had developed low lung function in childhood, suggesting that the abnormality was present early and persisted over time. In a study that used computed tomography (CT) to assess airway wall thickness, patients with severe asthma had thicker airway walls than those with mild asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-asthma/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>The importance of this feature of asthma is that remodeling may be an early component of asthma pathogenesis and patients who are prone to remodeling may need a different approach to treatment than those who are not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">MODULATORY FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of factors appear to influence whether susceptible individuals progress to overt asthma.
