For patients with extracranial metastatic melanoma, cytotoxic chemotherapy historically was widely used in patients who were not candidates for therapy with high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2), although this approach was never demonstrated to improve survival. However, with the development of new immunotherapy approaches and targeted therapy for <em>BRAF</em>-mutated tumors, chemotherapy is now generally limited to second- or third-line settings and is frequently omitted altogether.</p><p>The clinical role of cytotoxic chemotherapy, administered as a single agent, in combination chemotherapy regimens, or in combination with biological agents (IL-2, IFNa), will be reviewed here.

However, chemotherapy retains a role as therapy for patients whose disease can no longer be controlled with immunotherapy or targeted agents and who are not eligible or able to enroll in a clinical trial. Although chemotherapy has not been demonstrated to increase overall survival, combination regimens and single-agent chemotherapy have been associated with objective responses in a minority of patients.

Although there are no phase III trials that have demonstrated a survival benefit for dacarbazine compared with a &quot;no treatment&quot; control, it is approved for this indication in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytotoxic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Dacarbazine is generally considered to be the most active single agent in patients with metastatic melanoma, with a response rate of 8 to 20 percent. The vast majority of responses are only partial, and the median response duration is four to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytotoxic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Long-term follow-up of patients treated with dacarbazine indicates that less than 2 percent of patients can be anticipated to survive six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytotoxic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dacarbazine</a> is generally well tolerated, with the major side effect being nausea and vomiting. Dacarbazine administration requires good venous access because of the potential for chemical phlebitis. Bone marrow suppression is usually only modest, and alopecia and fatigue are minimal, allowing most patients to maintain relatively normal function while receiving therapy.</p><p>Typical schedules for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a> are 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> intravenously for five days or 850 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> intravenously over one hour every two to four weeks. Response rates and response duration do not appear to be affected by the administration schedule. The availability of powerful antiemetic agents permits the more convenient, one day every three to four weeks schedule to be administered in an outpatient setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical trials comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a> with either single-agent BRAF inhibitors or anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors have consistently demonstrated a significant overall survival advantage for these newer approaches.

In contrast to dacarbazine, temozolomide does not require metabolic activation. Unlike dacarbazine, temozolomide is orally absorbed; it can cross the blood brain barrier and may have some activity in brain metastases.

Similarly, in a trial conducted by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) in 859 patients with metastatic melanoma, there was no difference in overall or progression-free survival (median 9.1 versus 9.4 and 2.3 versus 2.2 months, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytotoxic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Experimental approaches to augment the activity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> have not been successful, and the clinical data have not been sufficiently compelling to achieve US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100474841\"><span class=\"h2\">Fotemustine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nitrosoureas fotemustine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carmustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carmustine</a> (BCNU), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lomustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lomustine</a> (CCNU) all have produced overall response rates of 13 to 18 percent in patients with metastatic melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytotoxic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/3,4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,9</a>].

The objective response rate was twice as high with fotemustine compared with dacarbazine (15 versus 7 percent), but the median time to progression (1.9 and 1.8 months, respectively) and median survival (7.3 and 5.6 months, respectively) were not significantly different. Among patients without brain metastases, those randomly assigned to fotemustine had a lower risk of cerebral progression (18 versus 23 percent) and a significantly longer time to the development of brain metastases (22.7 versus 7.2 months) compared with those assigned to dacarbazine. This finding requires independent confirmation.</p><p>Although there were some initially encouraging results when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lomustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lomustine</a> was administered via the hepatic artery, a randomized trial failed to demonstrate any improvement in survival when compared with intravenous administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytotoxic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.
