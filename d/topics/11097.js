Foals less than six months old are uniquely susceptible to the development of a chronic suppurative bronchopneumonia that can lead to lung and bronchial lymph node abscesses, sometimes called &quot;rattles&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Ulcerative colitis and mesenteric adenitis may also occur, usually associated with pulmonary infection. In swine, <em>R. equi</em> is commonly isolated from the lymph nodes of animals with submaxillary adenitis. The organism can rarely cause pulmonary and extrapulmonary abscesses, wound infections, and lymphadenitis in other animals, primarily rooting and grazing mammals. However, when hosts other than foals and swine develop <em>R. equi</em> infections, they are frequently immunocompromised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The first case of human infection was reported in 1967 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; only 12 additional cases were reported in the next 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. While still rare, <em>R. equi</em> has been isolated increasingly, especially as an opportunistic pathogen. Most human infections have been associated with immune system dysfunction, and a dramatic increase occurred in the setting of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/5-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-14</a>]. In addition, improved laboratory identification of infections in both immunocompromised and normal humans has led to increasing recognition of <em>R. equi</em> as a pathogen.</p><p>The microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of <em>R. equi</em> infections will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-therapy-and-prevention-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of Rhodococcus equi infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>R. equi</em> was originally named <em>C. equi</em> in 1923 based upon its morphologic appearance. Subsequently, the cell wall composition and biochemical reactions were found to be more closely related to <em>Nocardia</em> and mycobacteria than corynebacteria; in 1980, the organism was reclassified in the genus <em>Rhodococcus</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of nocardiosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis: Natural history, microbiology, and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Part of the phylogenetic group of nocardioform actinomycetes, <em>Rhodococcus</em> is characterized in part by rod-to-coccus growth cycle variation and the presence of tuberculostearic acid and cell wall mycolic acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Little is known about the pathogenic potential of rhodococci other than <em>R. equi</em>. Some have been isolated from granulomatous lesions in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], but reports of disease are rare.</p><p><em>R. equi</em> is easily cultivated on ordinary nonselective media when incubated aerobically at 37&ordm;C. Large, smooth, irregular, highly mucoid colonies develop by 48 hours. Although named for its production of red pigment, cultures less than four days old rarely appear pigmented. After four to seven days of incubation, colonies usually develop a delicate salmon pink color, although they may also be nonpigmented or slightly yellow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64676\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64676 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Pleomorphism characterizes this gram-positive organism. On solid media and in clinical specimens, it typically appears coccoid, but in liquid media, particularly in young cultures, it forms long rods or short filaments, at times with rudimentary branching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The organisms can be acid fast with the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, but this is not a constant feature and is related to the age of the culture and the growth media. Growth on Lowenstein-Jensen agar, one medium used to isolate mycobacteria, may promote acid-fastness.</p><p><em>R. equi</em> is non-carbohydrate fermenting (distinguishing it from pathogenic corynebacteria), gelatinase-negative, catalase positive, usually urease positive, and oxidase negative. So-called equi factors are elaborated that interact with the products of other organisms, including the beta toxin of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, to produce hemolysis. Lipase and phosphatase are produced, but not DNase, elastase, or protease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. At least 27 different polysaccharide capsular serotypes have been identified, but no relationship between serotype and virulence has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In the modern microbiology laboratory, a commercially available panel of biochemical tests (API Rapid CORYNE, bioM&eacute;rieux Vitek Inc., Hazelwood, MO) can be employed to easily identify <em>R. equi</em>. This panel should be applied to isolates with the typical colony characteristics and Gram's stain morphology or <em>R. equi</em>. It is crucial for the laboratory to perform these tests in order to recognize the pathogenic potential of such isolates, and not to discount them automatically as contaminants. </p><p>Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry identification has also been found to be a rapid and accurate system for identification of <em>Rhodococcus</em>. In one study, the correlation between API and MALDI-TOF results was 91 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(10/11),</span> with MALDI-TOF identifying one isolate as Dietzia maris (a closely related pathogen that is even more rare in humans), which was confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Another group found that 8 of 15 clinical isolates presumptively identified as <em>R. equi</em> by API Rapid CORYNE actually belonged to the genus Dietzia when 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4013778748\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>R. equi</em> is a soil organism carried in the gut of many herbivores and widespread in their environment. In one report, it was isolated from 54 percent of soil sites examined in Australia, including 18 of 19 horse farms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Most isolates were from areas where animals had grazed. <em>R. equi</em> was isolated from gut contents or dung of all herbivores examined that grazed in those areas, but from none that were penned and unable to graze.</p><p>On horse farms, progressive environmental contamination with <em>R. equi</em> has been related to the length of time that animals were present. The highest numbers of organisms have been found in the surface soil on horse farms with endemic disease. The number of organisms isolated from the air increased with warmer temperatures and was highest on dry and windy days. The simple nutrient growth requirements of <em>R. equi</em> are met completely by horse manure. Thus, the organism appears to thrive in the interaction between grazing herbivores and their environment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116344768\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to soil contaminated with herbivore manure is likely the major route of acquisition for both animal and human infection. Contact with farm animals or manure has been reported in 32 to 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. Considering that this epidemiologic information is not often sought or reported, the true percentage may be even higher.</p><p>The presentation of <em>R. equi</em> infections either as pneumonia or as disease associated with the gastrointestinal tract without pulmonary involvement suggests that humans and animals can acquire infection by either inhalation or ingestion of contaminated material. Human and animal infection can also be acquired by traumatic inoculation or superinfection of wounds. Clinically, the pulmonary route predominates in humans. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-therapy-and-prevention-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of Rhodococcus equi infections&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>A survey of Australian farms found that the prevalence of <em>R. equi</em> pneumonia in foals was associated with the airborne burden of virulent <em>R. equi</em>, both the concentration as well as the proportion of <em>R. equi</em> bacteria that were virulent; however, it was not associated with the burden of virulent <em>R. equi</em> in the soil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, reducing the exposure of susceptible foals to airborne virulent <em>R. equi</em> might be the best way to reduce the rate of <em>R. equi</em> pneumonia. In a study of 30 horse breeding farms in central Kentucky, there were higher airborne rates of virulent <em>Rhodococcus</em> in stalls versus paddocks, and in the winter versus summer months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]; these findings may be helpful to inform infection control measures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induction of <em>R. equi</em> infection has been studied primarily in the foal, its major natural host, and in murine models.

The organism appears to evade killing by interfering with phagosome-lysosome fusion; induction of nonspecific lysosome degranulation may be the means by which infected macrophages and surrounding tissues are destroyed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Variation in the virulence of <em>R. equi</em> isolates has been demonstrated in experimentally infected mice and foals; clinical isolates are usually more pathogenic than environmental isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, assays of extracellular enzyme production by clinical and environmental isolates reveal no clear differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The ability of different serotypes to resist clearance from the lung and spleen and to evade phagocytosis and intracellular killing by peritoneal macrophages is associated with virulence in murine models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>High-level virulence in mice and foals has also been associated with the presence of 15 to 17 kDA antigens, the expression of which is dependent upon the presence of 85- and 90-kb plasmids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Three-quarters of pathogenic isolates from humans with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been found to contain these antigens or a 20 kDa one, which requires the presence of 70 to 95 kb plasmids and is associated with intermediate virulence in murine models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The 20 kDa antigen has been identified in swine submaxillary gland isolates, suggesting a possible epidemiologic link [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, no virulence antigens have been detected in pathogenic isolates from other immunocompromised hosts such as renal transplant recipients or patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defective intracellular processing of <em>R. equi</em> leads to a characteristic histopathologic pattern in clinical specimens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Granulomatous reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical appearance is a necrotizing granulomatous reaction dominated by macrophages filled with granular cytoplasm that is periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain-positive and may contain large numbers of gram-positive coccobacillary forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In a report of five patients with pulmonary nodules clinically suspicious for lung cancer, the histology was compatible with malacoplakia and <em>R. equi</em> was identified in all cases by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Malacoplakia is characterized by aggregates of PAS positive histiocytes containing lamellated iron and calcium inclusions named Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. These structures are believed to result from incomplete intracellular digestion of engulfed bacteria by macrophages. Residual intralysosomal debris acts as a nidus for mineralization and leads to the development of complex lysosomal bodies demonstrable by Prussian blue (iron) and von Kossa (calcium) stains. Although this pathologic response is not pathognomonic of <em>R. equi</em> infection, since it can be observed in infections caused by coliform bacteria and occasionally mycobacteria, the association with <em>R. equi</em> is strong.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3013857147\"><span class=\"h3\">Other findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>R. equi</em> infection rarely produces a pathologic appearance that resembles Whipple's disease.

Infection in some humans with normal immunologic function may arise from a similar route. Several cases illustrate a potential for the organism to disseminate to regional lymph nodes in immunocompetent individuals and to persist. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An asymptomatic woman had mesenteric adenitis with <em>R. equi</em> noted incidentally at laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alcoholic man developed <em>R. equi</em> peritonitis during an episode of hepatic decompensation; the organism was found in mesenteric nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p>Manifestations of <em>R. equi</em> infection in immunocompromised humans resemble those in foals. Most knowledge about immune responses to <em>R. equi</em> infection comes from animal research. Both humoral and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) appear important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Humoral immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibodies to <em>R. equi</em> are widespread in the mature horse population.

Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions are widespread in horses demonstrating ubiquitous exposure to <em>R. equi</em>. Experimental equine infections can induce such immune responses as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Euthymic mice treated with antibodies to either interferon gamma or tumor necrosis factor-(TNF) alpha had higher colony counts of <em>R. equi</em> in tissues compared to untreated animals in a model where the organism was injected intravenously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

However, in vitro killing by macrophages was enhanced by exposure to supernatants from lymphocyte cultures stimulated with <em>R. equi</em> antigens. Phagosome-lysosome fusion within macrophages was markedly increased with opsonized compared to non-opsonized bacteria.
