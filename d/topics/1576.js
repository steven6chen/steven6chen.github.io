It is characterized by immunologic and autoimmunologic features, generally including the presence of circulating autoantibodies and high serum globulin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since it was first described in the 1950s, the disorder has been known by a variety of terms, including active chronic hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, chronic aggressive hepatitis, lupoid hepatitis, plasma cell hepatitis, and, most commonly, autoimmune chronic active hepatitis. In 1992, the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group recommended autoimmune hepatitis as the most appropriate and least redundant term for this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis &ndash; Type 1, or classic autoimmune hepatitis, is characterized by circulating antibodies to nuclei (ANA) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> smooth muscle (ASMA); the latter are thought to be reflective of more specific antiactin antibodies (AAA). AAA is not generally measured in most clinical laboratories, but ASMA with titers of 1:320 or greater generally reflect the presence of AAA. An ELISA technique for detecting antiactin antibodies (IgG anti F-actin) is available in some laboratories and is being used more frequently in commercial laboratories in North America. Other autoantibodies can occur in conjunction with or independent of ANA and ASMA. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Autoantibodies'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Serologic markers&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 autoimmune hepatitis &ndash; Type 2 autoimmune hepatitis is defined by the presence of antibodies to <span class=\"nowrap\">liver/kidney</span> microsomes (ALKM-1) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to a liver cytosol antigen (ALC-1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65135\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65135 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p>The clinical manifestations of autoimmune hepatitis will be reviewed here. The treatment of this disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1061186526\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmune hepatitis is seen in all ethnic groups and can occur at any age, though it is often diagnosed in patients in their 40s or 50s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. It is more common in women than in men (female to male ratio of 3.6 to 1). In studies from Europe, the incidence is 0.9 to 2 per 100,000 population per year, with a prevalence of 11 to 25 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmune hepatitis has a heterogeneous and fluctuating nature, leading to marked variability in its clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. The spectrum includes asymptomatic patients, those with considerable and sometimes debilitating symptoms, and those with acute liver failure. Furthermore, long periods of subclinical disease may occur before or after presentation. Physical findings range from a normal physical examination to the presence of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, stigmata of chronic liver disease, and jaundice.</p><p>Asymptomatic patients may be identified when they undergo routine screening examinations, such as those required for entrance to schools, for employment, or prior to blood donation. In this setting, the finding of an elevated aminotransferase level may be the only clue to the presence of liver disease. On occasion, the asymptomatic patient is discovered when abdominal surgery is performed for some other reason and the surgeon notes an abnormal, sometimes frankly cirrhotic-appearing liver.</p><p>At the far end of the spectrum are those patients who present acutely, sometimes with acute liver failure, perhaps with profound jaundice, an elevated prothrombin time, and aminotransferase values &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Such a presentation is uncommon with autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The presence of infiltrate in the portal areas and plasma cell infiltrates can help distinguish such patients from those with other forms of acute hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Many patients with an acute presentation have established cirrhosis when biopsied. Thus, they must have had subclinical disease for some period of time. One report found that patients with an acute onset were significantly older than those with a more chronic presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The duration of the subclinical anicteric course is generally difficult to ascertain. In some cases, in retrospect, a previous fluctuating course can be identified which had been thought to reflect some other disease.</p><p>In addition to asymptomatic disease and a sudden presentation, some patients present with a variety of mild or severe nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, lethargy, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, and itching. Although not specific to autoimmune hepatitis, arthralgia involving the small joints is a characteristic clinical feature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Extrahepatic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One clue to diagnosing autoimmune hepatitis may be the coexistence of other diseases with autoimmune features. In the spectrum of autoimmune disease, classified from organ-specific to non-organ-specific, autoimmune liver diseases fall somewhere in the middle. The disease is usually confined to the liver but can be associated with a number of other autoimmune diseases.</p><p>Diseases commonly seen with autoimmune hepatitis include hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), type 1 diabetes mellitus, thyroiditis, celiac sprue, and ulcerative colitis (which is more often associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis). The liver disease may antedate the appearance of colitis in both disorders. In addition, a polyglandular autoimmune syndrome can occur in children with type 2 autoimmune hepatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-associated-extrahepatic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Associated extrahepatic disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complications of autoimmune hepatitis are those seen in any progressive liver disease and occur in patients with untreated or unresponsive disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Treatment&quot;</a>.) Primary hepatocellular carcinoma is thought to be a natural consequence of the chronic hepatitis-cirrhosis disease progression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiologic associations of hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.) Autoimmune hepatitis is not an exception to this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>], although progression to carcinoma is less frequent than in chronic viral hepatitis.</p><p>On occasion, patients with autoimmune hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma have hepatitis C as a complicating condition, making the association with autoimmune hepatitis uncertain. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> and other immunosuppressive agents may have a role in the development of some malignancies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemotherapy-hepatotoxicity-and-dose-modification-in-patients-with-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemotherapy hepatotoxicity and dose modification in patients with liver disease&quot;</a>.) One report found an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer in patients with autoimmune hepatitis treated with long-term immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71689815\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis is based upon characteristic serologic and histologic findings and the exclusion of other forms of chronic liver disease. It can often be strongly suspected based upon clinical and laboratory features, and thus a liver biopsy may not always be necessary in patients with typical findings on noninvasive testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Guidelines issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases in 2010 suggest the following diagnostic considerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis should be made in patients with compatible clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities. Compatible laboratory and histological abnormalities include abnormal liver biochemical tests, increased total IgG or gamma-globulin levels, serologic markers (antinuclear antibodies [ANA], antismooth muscle antibodies [ASMA], anti-liver-kidney microsome-1 antibodies [anti-LKM-1], or anti-liver cytosol antibody-1 [anti-LC1]), and interface hepatitis. Other conditions that can cause chronic hepatitis should be excluded.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In unclear cases (such as those who have few or atypical findings), a liver biopsy should be obtained and a standardized scoring system used as part of the assessment. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Histology'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Scoring systems'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In those who are negative for conventional autoantibodies, additional autoantibodies should be sought. At minimum, this should include anti-soluble <span class=\"nowrap\">liver/liver</span> pancreas antigen <span class=\"nowrap\">(anti-SLA/LP)</span> and atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholangiographic studies should be considered to exclude primary sclerosing cholangitis in adults who do not respond to corticosteroid therapy after three months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, cholangiographic studies should be considered to exclude autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with autoimmune hepatitis and inflammatory bowel disease should undergo cholangiographic studies to exclude primary sclerosing cholangitis.</p><p/><p>Some guidelines do require liver biopsy as part of the diagnostic evaluation, including 2015 guidelines from the European Association for the Study of the Liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Our approach is to obtain a liver biopsy if the diagnosis is unclear or to assess disease activity prior to initiating treatment (eg, treatment may not be required in asymptomatic patients with normal or near-normal serum aminotransferase and gamma globulin levels who have minimal necroinflammatory activity on liver biopsy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Indications for treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a general rule, aminotransferase elevations are more striking in autoimmune hepatitis than those of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.</p><p>In some cases, however, autoimmune hepatitis has a cholestatic picture marked by high levels of conjugated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Extrahepatic obstruction (diagnosed by imaging studies), and cholestatic forms of viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and the variant syndromes must be considered in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-disease-classification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Disease classification&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One characteristic laboratory feature of autoimmune hepatitis, although not universally present, is an elevation in serum globulins, particularly gamma globulins and, generally, IgG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74708\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74708 \">figure 1</a>). Hyperglobulinemia is generally associated with circulating autoantibodies, which are particularly helpful in identifying autoimmune hepatitis. On the other hand, partial IgA deficiency is seen particularly in children with both type 1 and, more frequently, type 2 disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic necroinflammatory disorder characterized histologically by the following nonspecific findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A portal mononuclear cell infiltrate, generally lymphoplasmacytic, often with occasional eosinophils, invades the sharply demarcated hepatocyte boundary (limiting plate) surrounding the portal triad and percolates into the surrounding lobule (periportal infiltrate) and beyond (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67909\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67909 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The periportal lesion, sometimes referred to as piecemeal necrosis or interface hepatitis, essentially spares the biliary tree but may involve more of the lobule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67959\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67959 \">picture 2</a>). There may also be centrizonal necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile duct changes (destructive and nondestructive cholangitis and ductopenia) are present in approximately 25 percent of patients. Granulomas are uncommonly seen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An exuberant plasma cell infiltrate, which in the past led to the use of the term plasma cell hepatitis, rosettes of hepatocytes, and multinucleated giant cells, may be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69850\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69850 \">picture 3</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrosis is present in all but the mildest forms of autoimmune hepatitis. Advanced fibrosis connects portal and central areas (bridging), which ultimately, by architectural distortion of the hepatic lobule and the appearance of regenerating nodules, results in cirrhosis.</p><p/><p>The nonspecific nature of the histologic changes makes the measurement of autoantibodies and IgG or gamma globulin an important part of the diagnostic approach to autoimmune hepatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the circulating autoantibodies commonly seen in type 1 autoimmune hepatitis are antinuclear, anti-smooth muscle, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antiactin antibodies. On occasion, antimitochondrial antibodies occur in autoimmune hepatitis, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. The characteristics of the major autoantibodies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Serologic markers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antiactin antibody measurements have not been generally performed in clinical laboratories in North America, but anti-smooth muscle antibody titers of 1:320 or greater generally reflect the presence of antiactin antibodies and can serve as a surrogate marker for these antibodies.</p><p>An ELISA technique for detecting antiactin antibodies (F-actin ELISA) is commercially available in some regions. In one study, F-actin ELISA were significantly more sensitive than ASMA titers (74 versus 34 percent) and similarly specific (98 versus 99 percent) in detecting autoimmune hepatitis in patients with various forms of chronic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Because the simplified criteria for the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis use autoantibodies measured by immunofluorescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], application of these criteria needs to be adapted to correspond to immunofluorescence titers.</p><p>Approximately 30 percent of patients with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis have antibodies directed against soluble <span class=\"nowrap\">liver/liver</span> pancreas antigen <span class=\"nowrap\">(anti-SLA/LP)</span>. Cytokeratins 8 and 18, subunits of glutathione S-transferases, and an as yet unidentified 50 kD protein were thought to be candidate antigens, but subsequent cloning and characterization of the antigen revealed that it is a unique enzyme (possibly a UGA-suppressor or tRNA-associated protein) and a member of the superfamily of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. This antibody appears to be identical to the anti liver-pancreas protein (thus the designation anti <span class=\"nowrap\">SLA/LP)</span> and is of the IgG1 subtype, suggesting that it may arise from a specific immune stimulus such as a viral protein. However, no homologous virus-derived peptides could be identified in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These antibodies may be helpful diagnostically in patients without ANA or ASMA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.) They occur in 10 to 30 percent of adults and in about 60 percent of children with autoimmune hepatitis.</p><p>Patients with ANA positive type 1 autoimmune hepatitis also may have other autoantibodies, including those directed against single-stranded (anti-ssDNA) and double-stranded (anti-dsDNA) DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA), which are found in high frequency in primary sclerosing cholangitis and idiopathic ulcerative colitis, are also common in type 1 autoimmune hepatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-serologic-markers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Serologic markers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In type 2 autoimmune hepatitis, ALKM-1 antibodies occur alone or accompanied by ALC-1 (LC1) antibodies or rarely ANA. However, some patients have only ALC-1 antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. As noted, anti <span class=\"nowrap\">SLA/LP</span> are common in children.</p><p>There are some patients who present with all the features of autoimmune hepatitis but lack circulating ANA, ASMA, anti <span class=\"nowrap\">SLA/LP,</span> ANCA, or ALKM-1 antibodies. These patients may be more easily identified in the future as having autoimmune hepatitis when assays for other characteristic antibodies in this disorder become available. At present, they are considered to have cryptogenic chronic hepatitis or cryptogenic cirrhosis. A therapeutic response to anti-inflammatory therapy may be the only indication that autoimmune hepatitis is the underlying disease in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Scoring systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A scoring system developed and subsequently revised by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group to standardize the diagnosis for population studies and clinical trials has had limited value in individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,30</a>]. A less complicated system using simplified criteria to be used in individual patients is based upon titers of autoantibodies, IgG levels, liver histology, and the exclusion of viral hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoantibodies: assign one point if the ANA or ASMA are 1:40 OR assign two points if the ANA or ASMA are &ge;1:80 (OR if the LKM &ge;1:40 OR if the SLA is positive).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG: assign one point if the IgG is &gt; the upper limit of normal OR assign two points if the IgG is &gt;1.10 times the upper limit of normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver histology (evidence of hepatitis is a mandatory condition): assign one point if the histological features are compatible with autoimmune hepatitis OR two points if the histological features are typical of autoimmune hepatitis. Typical histologic features were defined as the presence of interface hepatitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphocytic/lymphoplasmacytic</span> infiltrates in the portal tracts and extending into the lobule, emperipolesis (active penetration of one cell into and through a large cell), and hepatic rosette formation. Compatible features were defined as a picture of chronic hepatitis with lymphocytic infiltration without all the features considered typical.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of viral hepatitis: assign two points if viral hepatitis has been excluded. In the validation study, patients were mainly tested for hepatitis B and C. However, other forms of hepatitis should be considered depending upon the clinical setting.</p><p/><p>A probable diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis is made if the total points are six, while a definite diagnosis is made if the total points are &ge;seven.</p><p>In a validation study involving 11 international centers, the simplified scoring system had 88 percent sensitivity and 97 percent specificity compared with a clinical and histologic reference standard when using a cutoff of &ge;six; the corresponding values were 81 and 99 percent, respectively, when using a cutoff of &ge;seven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Sensitivity was somewhat lower, but specificity remained high in a later validation study using a cutoff of &ge;seven (70 and 100 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>A potential limitation of the scoring system is the relative lack of standardization of some of the autoantibody tests across testing facilities. Nevertheless, in the validation studies above, the local standards for autoantibody testing at each center were used, suggesting that the model is relatively robust to these differences. Whether probable and definite autoimmune hepatitis (as assessed by response to treatment) represent valid, discreet categories is also uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In addition, the ability of the score to distinguish autoimmune hepatitis from autoimmune hepatitis overlap syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] will require further study. On the other hand, the score might help identify patients with overlap who have a treatable autoimmune component. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-variants-definitions-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis variants: Definitions and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The validation study did not include patients with drug-induced hepatitis, Wilson disease, genetic hemochromatosis, or alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, conditions that may share histologic features with autoimmune hepatitis. Thus, the score should be used in conjunction with the differential diagnosis.</p><p>Finally, although the presence of autoantibodies is included in the scoring system, their absence does not indicate a decreased likelihood of responding to therapy. This was illustrated in a report of 52 patients with autoimmune hepatitis based upon the scoring system, of whom 10 (19 percent) were seronegative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The prevalence of ANAs or ASMAs did not correlate with the clinical or histologic severity of autoimmune hepatitis or the response to immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis includes conditions associated with a chronic necroinflammatory picture that is often accompanied by fibrosis or cirrhosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63858\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63858 \">table 2</a>). The distinction between autoimmune hepatitis and the other autoimmune liver diseases, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, and overlap syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] is generally based upon clinical, histologic, and immunologic features.</p><p>Primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis may at times be indistinguishable from autoimmune hepatitis on liver biopsy, but commonly have features involving bile duct paucity, inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> damage, or periductular fibrosis that are not seen in autoimmune hepatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54128%7EGAST%2F66904%7EGAST%2F81040\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54128 graphicRef66904 graphicRef81040 \">picture 4A-C</a>). An evaluation of the autoantibody profile also may be helpful. Although antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) can occur in association with other autoantibodies in autoimmune hepatitis, the isolated presence of AMA usually signifies primary biliary cirrhosis. However, there have been rare instances in which AMA is the sole autoantibody seen in autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

However, antibodies to hepatitis C virus may not develop until 6 to 12 months after infection; as a result, a measurement of circulating hepatitis C virus RNA (eg, by polymerase chain reaction or other technique) is required to rule out hepatitis C.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and evaluation of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.) On the other hand, patients with chronic hepatitis C may make a variety of autoantibodies including rheumatoid factor and cryoglobulins; the presence of these autoantibodies does not imply the existence of autoimmune liver disease. In rare instances, chronic viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis coexist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Approximately 5 percent of patients in the United States and France with chronic hepatitis C have ANA or ASMA titers of 1:100 or greater.

One possible method of determining whether the hepatitis is primarily due to HCV or to autoimmune hepatitis is that the anti-LKM-1 antibodies in patients with HCV are directed at different epitopes of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6, the target antigen) from that seen with autoimmune hepatitis.

As noted above, autoimmune hepatitis may be associated with a number of autoimmune extrahepatic disorders similar to lupus. Autoantibodies may help to distinguish between autoimmune hepatitis and liver disease associated with lupus. Although ANA can be seen in both conditions, ASMA and AMA are rare in lupus; thus, their presence suggests that the patient has autoimmune hepatitis. On the other hand, there is a form of hepatitis that occurs in systemic lupus erythematosus which is distinct from autoimmune hepatitis. Its pathogenesis may be related to the presence of antiribosomal P protein antibodies.
