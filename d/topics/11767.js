The nitroso-thiols stimulate guanylate cyclase to produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which causes smooth muscle relaxation by decreasing intracellular calcium levels.

Hypovolemia or nitrate-induced hypotension respond promptly to volume replacement. Despite presumed correction of preload by the infusion of saline, the antiischemic effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> persists.</p><p>Prolonged infusion of high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> may lead to the development both of methemoglobinemia (which can be treated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>) and of heparin resistance. In addition, commercial preparations of intravenous nitroglycerin contain alcohol (0.01 to 0.14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/mg</span> of nitroglycerin).

In addition, the chronic administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> should not preclude therapy with beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.

It is administered to the patient with acute MI to improve symptoms, lower blood pressure, improve pulmonary congestion, and, in some cases, to help in the diagnosis of coronary artery spasm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasospastic-angina#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasospastic angina&quot;, section on 'Nitrates and calcium channel blockers'</a>.)</p><p>For the patient presenting to the emergency department with chest pain that may be due to cardiac ischemia, sublingual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> is commonly administered at a dose of 0.4 mg every five minutes for a total of three doses. One-half the dose (0.15 mg) can be used if the patient becomes hypotensive or develops symptoms such as headache or flushing with the higher doses. Up to 0.6 mg may be given to patients with refractory angina, particularly those with hypertension.

Several small trials have evaluated the ability of an open-label infusion of nitroglycerin to reduce the frequency of ischemic chest pain; symptomatic relief was noted in each of the reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. One randomized trial of 167 patients found that, compared to placebo, intravenous nitroglycerin reduced the frequency and duration of ischemic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, a single randomized trial compared the intravenous, oral, and transdermal nitroglycerin preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There was no difference in response among the preparations with regard to symptomatic improvement. However, the small size of this study (40 patients) makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">GISSI-3 trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the third Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio dell Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico (GISSI-3), 19,394 patients with acute MI between 1991 and 1993 were randomly assigned in a two-by-two factorial design to intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> followed by a nitrate patch or placebo, as well as to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Intravenous nitroglycerin was infused within the first 24 hours, starting at 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min</span> and increasing until the systolic blood pressure fell by 10 percent, avoiding systolic pressure below 90 mmHg. Nitrate patch and lisinopril were maintained for six weeks and the patients were followed for six months from the date of randomization.</p><p>The results were analyzed by intention to treat; however, 57 percent of the placebo group received short-term nitrate therapy for angina or heart failure and approximately 11 percent received long-term nitrate therapy. Most of the patients were treated with other appropriate therapies for MI at the time of the trial such as thrombolysis (72 percent), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (84 percent), and beta blockers (31 percent).</p><p>The primary study end point of mortality at six weeks demonstrated <strong>no significant benefit</strong> of nitrate therapy.

In GISSI-3, for example, the blood pressure lowering effect of intravenous nitroglycerin was lost within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrates-in-the-management-of-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, prolonged nitroglycerin infusions are not generally needed in acute coronary syndromes, since patients with ST elevation are either rapidly given fibrinolytic therapy or taken directly to the catheterization laboratory, while many patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes go to the catheterization laboratory within the first 48 hours.

As an example, chest pain is better managed with opioid analgesic agents and myocardial ischemia is treated with oxygen, beta blockers, and early reperfusion therapy with fibrinolysis or percutaneous coronary intervention. Similarly, pulmonary congestion often requires the combination of diuretics, nitrates, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> sulfate, while the lowering of blood pressure can be achieved with the combined use of beta blockers, nitrates, and anxiolytic therapy.
