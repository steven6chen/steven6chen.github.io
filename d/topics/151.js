This topic will review the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of achalasia. The management of achalasia is discussed separately.

Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease can occur at any age, but onset before adolescence is rare. Achalasia is usually diagnosed in patients between the ages of 25 and 60 years. </p><p>Achalasia may occur in association with adrenal insufficiency and alacrima in patients with triple A syndrome or Allgrove syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2107220471\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of primary or idiopathic achalasia is unknown. Secondary achalasia is due to diseases that cause esophageal motor abnormalities similar or identical to those of primary achalasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71111\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71111 \">table 1</a>). In Chagas disease, which occurs predominantly in Central and South America, esophageal infection with the protozoan parasite <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> can result in a loss of intramural ganglion cells, leading to aperistalsis and incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other diseases that have been associated with achalasia-like motor abnormalities include amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, neurofibromatosis, eosinophilic esophagitis, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B, juvenile Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and Fabry disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Pathology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1453290685\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Achalasia results from inflammation and degeneration of neurons in the esophageal wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54138\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54138 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The cause of the inflammatory degeneration of neurons in primary achalasia is not known. The observations that achalasia is associated with variants in the HLA-DQ region and that affected patients often have circulating antibodies to enteric neurons suggest that achalasia is an autoimmune disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Some investigators have proposed that the inflammatory attack on esophageal neurons in achalasia is triggered by an antibody response to viral infections (eg, herpes zoster, measles viruses), but data have been inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. A study evaluating T cells in patients with achalasia found reactivity to HSV-1, suggesting that achalasia may be triggered by HSV-1 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A genetic predisposition to the inflammatory degeneration of ganglion cells in achalasia is suggested by its association with variants in the HLA-DQ region and by its occurrence in genetic syndromes such as Allgrove syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H194739120\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Histologic examination of the esophagus in patients with achalasia reveals decreased numbers of neurons (ganglion cells) in the myenteric plexuses, and the ganglion cells that remain often are surrounded by lymphocytes and, less prominently, by eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. This inflammatory degeneration preferentially involves the nitric oxide-producing, inhibitory neurons that affect the relaxation of esophageal smooth muscle; the cholinergic neurons that contribute to lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone by causing smooth muscle contraction may be relatively spared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In some patients, degenerative changes are also found in the ganglion cells of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in the brainstem, and Wallerian degeneration has been observed in the vagal fibers that supply the esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54138\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54138 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, the disordered motility that characterizes achalasia appears to result primarily from the loss of inhibitory neurons within the wall of the esophagus itself. Loss of inhibitory innervation in the LES causes the basal sphincter pressure to rise, and renders the sphincter muscle incapable of normal relaxation. In the smooth muscle portion of the esophageal body, the loss of inhibitory neurons results in aperistalsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The manifestations of achalasia depend on the degree and location of ganglion cell loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Loss of peristalsis in the distal esophagus and a failure of LES relaxation with swallowing both impair esophageal emptying; however, most of the symptoms and signs of achalasia are due primarily to the defect in LES relaxation (esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction).</p><p>In addition, patients with achalasia may also have a subtle defect in reflex relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The abrupt esophageal distention that results when gas from the stomach suddenly enters the esophagus normally triggers a reflex relaxation of the UES, thereby allowing the gas to escape through the mouth in the form of a belch. The UES belch reflex can be demonstrated experimentally by injecting air into the esophagus. In normal subjects, esophageal air injection causes UES relaxation that is accompanied by an audible belch. In patients with achalasia, however, air injected into the esophagus frequently causes a paradoxical increase in UES pressure without a belch. This abnormal reflex presumably results from the loss of inhibitory neurons, although the precise neural pathways that affect the reflex are not clear. The inability to burp in some patients with achalasia may contribute to the esophageal distention and chest pain that often accompany the disease. Patients with achalasia may also have impaired gastric relaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34211525\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Achalasia has an insidious onset, and disease progression is gradual. Patients typically experience symptoms for years prior to seeking medical attention. In one series of 87 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed achalasia, the mean duration of symptoms was 4.7 years prior to the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The delay in diagnosis was mainly due to misinterpretation of typical clinical features. Patients are often treated for other disorders including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) before the diagnosis of achalasia is established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H198500171\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysphagia for solids (91 percent) and liquids (85 percent) and regurgitation of bland undigested food or saliva (76 to 91 percent) are the most frequent symptoms in patients with achalasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62139\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62139 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Regurgitation of retained material in the esophagus, especially while recumbent, may result in aspiration (8 percent). Patients may also induce vomiting to relieve a sensation of retrosternal fullness after a meal. Up to 85 percent of patients have difficulty belching, which may be due to a defect in relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter. Substernal chest pain and heartburn occur in approximately 40 to 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The etiology of chest pain in patients with achalasia is unclear as it does not always correlate with radiographic or manometric findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Chest pain is more common in younger patients and often fails to respond to treatment, but tends to diminish over the course of several years. (See <a href=\"#H1453290685\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-of-esophageal-origin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with chest pain of esophageal origin&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients frequently report retrosternal burning discomfort similar to the heartburn typical of GERD. This may in fact be due to gastroesophageal reflux, or to direct irritation of the esophageal lining by food, pills, or lactate production by bacterial fermentation of retained carbohydrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Abnormal esophageal motor activity also might trigger the sensation of heartburn.</p><p>Patients may have hiccups due to obstruction of the distal esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In order to overcome the distal obstruction, affected patients eat more slowly and often adopt specific maneuvers such as lifting the neck or throwing the shoulders back in order to enhance esophageal emptying. In rare cases, patients may present with a globus sensation. Weight loss is usually mild, although significant weight loss may be seen in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Rapid progression of dysphagia and profound weight loss are suggestive of pseudoachalasia due to a malignancy.

High-resolution manometry may have a higher sensitivity in diagnosing achalasia as compared with conventional manometry, as it provides enhanced detail in the characterization of achalasia and the morphology of the EGJ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. High-resolution manometry can also be used to accurately categorize achalasia into one of three distinctive subtypes, which can guide management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-44</a>]. Conventional manometry cannot reliably identify the type II and III achalasia, an important distinction as the prognostic implications for these entities are different.

Vigorous achalasia is an outdated term that has been used for patients who have simultaneous esophageal body contractions with amplitudes &gt;40 mmHg in the presence of a non-relaxing LES on conventional manometry, sometimes associated with spastic esophageal activity on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Preserved peristalsis with esophageal contractions &gt;40 mmHg also has been described in patients with vigorous achalasia. The distinction between vigorous and classic achalasia appears to have little clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,47,48</a>]. Some patients diagnosed with vigorous achalasia by conventional manometry have type III achalasia by high-resolution manometry (HRM).

In patients with typical achalasia symptoms (dysphagia to solids and liquids and regurgitation of bland undigested food or saliva) and equivocal manometric findings, the diagnosis is supported by aperistalsis, dilation of the esophagus, narrow esophagogastric junction, and poor emptying on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> esophagram. Pseudoachalasia due to cancer at the esophagogastric junction should be excluded by endoscopic evaluation as discussed above.

The differential diagnosis of achalasia also includes other esophageal motility disorders and pseudoachalasia due to a malignancy. The differential diagnosis of dysphagia is discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the evaluation of dysphagia in adults&quot;, section on 'Symptom-based differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</strong> &ndash; In patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), regurgitated food is typically sour tasting due to the presence of gastric acid. In contrast, in patients with achalasia, food and saliva are regurgitated from the esophagus and are therefore bland. Esophageal manometry is diagnostic of achalasia. In contrast, patients with GERD often have non-specific manometric findings including ineffective esophageal motility, hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and excessive transient LES relaxations. (See <a href=\"#H386844726\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal manometry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pseudoachalasia</strong> &ndash; Malignancy can cause pseudoachalasia either by invading the esophageal neural plexuses directly (eg, adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction) or through the release of uncharacterized humoral factors that disrupt esophageal function as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome. In addition to gastric carcinoma, other tumors that can produce the syndrome include cancer of the esophagus, carcinoma of the lung, lymphoma, and pancreatic carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Patients with pseudoachalasia can have the same manometric findings as those with achalasia but can be differentiated by upper endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound. (See <a href=\"#H386844726\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal manometry'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2419126592\" class=\"local\">'Upper endoscopy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1610555655\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other esophageal motility disorders</strong> &ndash; Patients with diffuse (distal) esophageal spasm and jackhammer (nutcracker) esophagus may also present with dysphagia to solids and liquids.
