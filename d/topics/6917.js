The injury occurs most often in the workplace or during contact or ball-handling sports. It is most common in young to middle-aged males, which may reflect their higher rates of participation in such sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis and management of mallet finger injuries will be reviewed here. Other finger injuries are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-phalanx-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal phalanx fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-jersey-finger\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexor tendon injury of the distal interphalangeal joint (jersey finger)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic disruption of the terminal slip of the extensor tendon at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint is commonly referred to as a mallet finger (or less often as a baseball or drop finger) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50968\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50968 \">figure 1</a>). The terminal slip is formed by the convergence of the extensor lateral bands and inserts on the distal phalanx. It is primarily responsible for extension of the DIP joint. A zone of relative avascularity just proximal to the extensor tendon insertion predisposes the tendon to injury at this site. A more detailed discussion of finger anatomy is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-and-thumb-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Finger and thumb anatomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mallet finger occurs most commonly during collision sports, such as American football and rugby, or ball-handling sports, such as basketball and baseball. The injury is usually caused by a direct blow to the tip of the finger, such as when a ball strikes the fingertip or the fingertip strikes a rigid surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66023\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66023 \">figure 2</a>). The axial load from the blow causes sudden, forceful flexion of the distal phalanx. This flexion damages the extensor tendon where it attaches to the proximal portion of the distal phalanx. Less frequently, a mallet finger may occur as part of finger injuries involving dorsal lacerations or crushing mechanisms.</p><p>With mallet finger injuries, the tendon may be partially torn, completely ruptured, or associated with an avulsion fracture of the distal phalanx. Unopposed flexion leads to a fixed flexion deformity (called extensor lag) at the DIP joint if the injury remains untreated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77830\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77830 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mallet finger most often involves the middle finger and next most often the ring finger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with a mallet finger complain of pain over the dorsum of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. Swelling, ecchymosis, and deformity may be present, especially if there is an avulsion fracture. The most characteristic feature is an inability to extend the DIP joint fully, resulting in a flexed DIP at rest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77830\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77830 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>When evaluating DIP motion, it is important to isolate the function of the extensor tendon by holding the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint in full extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65342\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65342 \">picture 2</a>). This minimizes the contribution of the central slip to DIP extension. With the PIP joint stabilized, test active extension at the DIP joint. The patient with a mallet finger will be unable to extend the distal phalanx actively but the joint usually can be extended passively.</p><p>The degree of DIP angulation often reflects the severity of the tendon disruption. With full tears, there is greater than 30 degrees of extensor lag, and the DIP joint cannot be extended. Partial tears exhibit 5 to 20 degrees of extensor lag along with weak active extension. The development of extensor lag may be delayed by a few hours to a few days after the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Inability to fully extend the DIP joint passively suggests bony or soft tissue entrapment, and the need for surgical referral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral'</a> below.)</p><p>As part of the complete examination of an injured digit, the clinician should assess the finger's neurovascular function and inspect the soft tissue for lacerations. The lateral stability of the DIP joint should be evaluated by placing a radial and then, ulnar stress on the joint. Comparison with the corresponding finger of the opposite hand can help to determine if laxity is present, which suggests a collateral ligament injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiography should be performed on all mallet finger deformities to evaluate for fractures of the distal phalanx and for alignment abnormalities. Radiographs should include anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and oblique views [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Avulsion fractures and volar (palmar) subluxation of the distal phalanx are best seen on a true lateral view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50157\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50157 \">image 1</a>). Mallet finger injuries involving fractures of the base of the distal phalanx can be characterized according to the presence or absence of subluxation and the degree of involvement of the articular surface in the DIP fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41426083\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of classification systems used for mallet finger injuries based upon the severity of injury and treatment outcome. The most commonly used system is the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1: Closed or blunt trauma with loss of tendon continuity with or without a small avulsion fracture</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2: Laceration at or proximal to the distal interphalangeal joint with loss of tendon continuity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 3: Deep abrasion with loss of skin, subcutaneous cover, and tendon substance</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 4: Mallet fracture</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>4A: Transphyseal fracture in children</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>4B: Hyperflexion injury with fracture involving 20 to 50 percent of the articular surface </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>4C: Hyperextension injury with fracture involving over 50 percent of the articular surface, and with early or late volar subluxation of the distal phalanx </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of mallet finger injuries can be managed by primary care clinicians, but more complex injuries warrant evaluation by an orthopedic or hand surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>].

However, the results of two systematic reviews and several case series suggest that nonsurgical treatment may be appropriate in many such cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>].</p><p>In one retrospective study, treatment of 22 closed mallet finger fractures involving one to two thirds of the articular surface with six weeks of extension splinting achieved similar results to surgical correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The assessed outcomes included residual extensor lag, pain, function, and satisfaction with finger appearance. Injuries with palmar subluxation were more prone to joint disfigurement. All patients reported minimal functional impairment and pain, and there was no significant difference in outcomes between patients managed with splinting alone or with surgical repair. The authors concluded that nonoperative management is appropriate for most cases, but that surgical pinning may be necessary for cases that are refractory to splinting (eg, demonstrate persistent extensor lag) or involve swan-neck deformities.</p><p>The patient's preferences and goals should be taken into account when deciding whether to perform surgery. Factors to consider include the patient's ability to comply rigorously with conservative therapy, the amount of functional disability present including the degree of extension loss, and the time since the initial injury. Surgical treatment carries the risk of infection and a stiff DIP joint.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute mallet finger</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of mallet finger treatment is to maximize the function of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint while minimizing discomfort. The majority of mallet fingers are amenable to treatment with immobilization (ie, splinting), but some complex injuries warrant surgical referral. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral'</a> above.)</p><p>The general consensus among experts is that uncomplicated mallet finger injuries without DIP joint subluxation are best treated with splinting. The central slip of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint prevents excessive retraction of the damaged tendon, allowing close approximation and healing of the torn tendon sections to occur with splinting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Most experts immobilize the DIP joint in full extension or slight hyperextension (5 to 15 degrees), while allowing full range of motion of the PIP joint. Clinical experience and the results of one cadaveric study that assessed the biomechanics of mallet finger injuries support this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Primary care and emergency clinicians should <strong>not</strong> attempt to reduce any displaced fractures before splinting because any reduction is unlikely to be maintained without surgery; mallet fingers with associated fractures are referred. </p><p>An aluminum splint can be applied to either the palmar or dorsal surface of the middle and distal phalanx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53614\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53614 \">picture 3</a>). If possible, the splint should be bent slightly to stabilize the DIP joint in 5 to 10 degrees of hyperextension. Hyperextension may be limited initially by swelling or skin tightness. A stack splint may be used provided the splint is sufficiently tight to prevent any DIP flexion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67892\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67892 \">picture 4</a>). Custom-made perforated splints similar to stack splints can be made for fingers that are difficult to fit and they provide better aeration. An Abouna splint or metal ring splints are generally not used because of patient discomfort.</p><p>Care should be taken to avoid direct, sustained pressure from the splint on the area of the DIP joint. Excessive pressure or hyperextension can cause skin necrosis. The Kleinert modified dorsal splint attempts to avoid this complication by removing the middle third of the foam padding from the splint, thereby eliminating all direct pressure at the injury site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83565\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83565 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83566\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83566 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In some instances, a swan neck deformity (indicating involvement of the central slip) accompanies a mallet finger injury. In such cases, both the DIP and the PIP joints should be immobilized in full extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Most cases heal well with splinting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A swan neck deformity appears as a hyperextended PIP joint and a flexed DIP joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55390\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55390 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>A systematic review identified only four randomized or quasi-randomized placebo-controlled trials, involving a total of 278 patients that compared treatments for mallet finger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. One trial included in the review found no difference in outcomes or complications between fractures treated with splinting versus surgery using wire fixation.</p><p>Two systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to determine the best method for splinting a mallet finger, and the results of two subsequent randomized trials are consistent with this conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/6,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15</a>]. One review found fewer skin complications with custom orthosis versus prefabricated orthosis, but no differences in treatment success, failure, or extensor lag [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a randomized trial involving 116 mallet fingers, patients with custom-made splints had fewer treatment failures compared to those with stack splints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Improved outcomes in patients treated with custom splints were noted in one other randomized trial of 64 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>However, several trials have found that splint type does not affect outcome. A randomized trial involving 60 patients reported that aluminum splints fit better and caused fewer skin-related complications than stack splints, but both splints were equally effective for enabling tendon healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Another randomized trial of 77 patients reported no significant difference in extensor lag or complications based upon the type of splint selected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. We suggest selecting a splint based upon patient comfort in order to maximize compliance, provided the splint is sturdy and ensures adequate immobilization and proper positioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DIP joint extension splinting is performed for six to eight weeks. The DIP joint <strong>MUST</strong> be maintained in full extension throughout the entire period, including during sleep. Adherence to this instruction is essential. The most common reason for treatment failure is noncompliance. Whenever the splint is removed (eg, to clean the finger or change the splint), the patient must support the distal fingertip in full extension at all times. Should DIP joint extension be lost at any point during the initial treatment period, the treatment clock is reset and an additional six weeks of splinting must be performed. The patient should be seen every one to two weeks to check on compliance and complications.</p><p>After six to eight weeks of continuous extension splinting with the DIP joint maintained in full extension, the joint is reexamined and active extension assessed. If the patient is able to achieve full extension, an additional two to four weeks of nighttime splinting is performed.</p><p>Splinting should be maintained for ALL athletic events for another six weeks. If necessary, the foam padding of the aluminum splint may be removed and the aluminum secured directly to the dorsum of the finger to allow the returning athlete to fit the finger into a glove [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Active range-of-motion exercises are encouraged in these patients to minimize DIP stiffness.</p><p>If a significant extension lag (ie, volar angulation) persists following the initial six weeks of splinting, the splint is reapplied for up to six additional weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As with the initial treatment period, the DIP joint MUST be strictly maintained in full extension throughout the second treatment period. The joint should be reexamined every two weeks during this second treatment period. Once an acceptable outcome is achieved, a night splint is used for two to four additional weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic mallet finger</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic mallet fingers are those that go untreated for four weeks or longer. Several small case series suggest that splinting chronic mallet fingers that present within 12 weeks of the initial injury can improve outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/12,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20,21</a>]. All patients in these studies were treated with a stack or aluminum splint for 6 to 10 weeks. Extensor lag following treatment averaged 10 degrees.</p><p>Treatment of chronic mallet finger consists of DIP extension splinting lasting from 8 to 20 weeks. Patients should be warned about the increased risk of deformity and other complications with delayed presentation and treatment. A successful outcome may be more likely if the injury site appears to be actively inflamed, as suggested by continued swelling, erythema, or tenderness over the DIP joint, and there are no signs of complications, such as scarring or retraction of the tendon. If conservative treatment is unsuccessful, the patient should be referred to a hand surgeon.</p><p>Mallet fingers that fail to improve with splinting may be suitable for surgical repair if there is significant residual extensor lag (&gt;30 degrees) or functional limitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Such patients should be referred to a hand surgeon. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO WORK OR SPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with mallet finger injuries may return to sport, provided proper hyperextension is maintained with adequate bracing. However, most contact sports are best avoided in the first six to eight weeks following injury. After the initial six to eight weeks of splinting, an additional six to eight weeks of buddy taping or splinting should be used during athletics. Clinicians must reinforce the importance of strict patient compliance with splinting and the possible long-term complications that will result from noncompliance or returning to play prematurely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compliance with treatment and length of immobilization are important determinants of overall outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Complications of mallet finger may result from lack of timely recognition and treatment, which may lead to chronic stiffness and deformity of the DIP joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77830\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77830 \">picture 1</a>). Complications may also occur as a result of splinting or surgery. Nearly all patients will have a small degree of extensor lag that does not interfere with daily activities.</p><p>Most complications from splinting are minor and resolve once treatment is concluded. Such complications include allergic reactions to tape, skin maceration and ulceration, and joint pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Skin complications can be minimized by avoiding hyperextension that causes pain or skin blanching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and examination findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical referral should be obtained if the mallet finger is associated with a fracture, the DIP joint cannot be passively extended, or there is DIP joint subluxation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that uncomplicated mallet finger injuries be treated by maintaining the DIP joint in full extension or minimally hyperextended using an appropriate splint (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). It is crucial that patients not allow flexion of the DIP <strong>at any time</strong> during the initial period of splinting (generally six to eight weeks). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DIP splinting is performed continuously for six to eight weeks. If no extensor lag exists at the end of this period, night splinting is then performed for two additional weeks.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bendre AA, Hartigan BJ, Kalainov DM.
