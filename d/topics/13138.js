MS attenuates the atrial contribution to left ventricular filling and it also poses a hydraulic opposition or resistance to early filling. Unlike other valvular lesions, which are often attributable to many etiologies, MS alone, or in combination with other valvular pathology, is almost exclusively secondary to rheumatic heart disease. Progression of MS eventually leads to the development of disabling symptoms (eg, dyspnea, hemoptysis, thromboembolism, and right-sided heart failure). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The natural history and pathophysiology of MS will be reviewed here. Given the widespread use of surgical and percutaneous interventions, information on the natural history of MS comes from older studies and other limited observations of patients in developing countries who did not receive a corrective procedure.</p><p>The roles of medical and surgical therapy and the use of percutaneous balloon valvotomy are discussed separately.

However, only 50 to 70 percent of patients with MS report a history of rheumatic fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. RHD remains a major public health problem in developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Rheumatic MS has become less common in developed countries given marked reductions in the incidence of rheumatic fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Occasional outbreaks of rheumatic fever in the United States appear to be the result of either increased virulence of a streptococcal strain or enhanced immigration from areas where RHD is prevalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Involvement of the mitral valve is present in approximately 90 percent of individuals with RHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Since rheumatic MS is a chronic condition it is not seen during the first episode of acute rheumatic carditis. In many populations, RHD is more common in females than in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Rheumatic MS is a continuously progressive lifelong disease.

These valve abnormalities may only manifest 10 to 20 years after radiation treatment. Isolated MS is a rare complication from prior radiation.

The inflammatory process in the valve leaflets is thought to be initiated by cross-reactivity between streptococcal antigen and the valve tissue; there is no evidence for active infection of the valve leaflets. Mitral disease begins with the formation of tiny nodules located along the coapting portions of the valve leaflets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The leaflets thicken with eventual deposition of fibrin on the cusps and loss of normal valve morphology. Although the incidence of RHD is variable after an episode of acute rheumatic fever, approximately 50 percent of those with evidence of carditis <br/><br/>develop organic valvular damage. In addition, up to 75 percent of patients with documented recurrences of rheumatic fever have some form of valvular disease after 45 years of follow-up (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104279\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104279 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Chronic RHD affecting the mitral valve apparatus progresses over years to decades and causes a number of pathologic changes, affecting the mitral valve apparatus, which are diagnostic for rheumatic valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16</a>]: fusion of the leaflet commissures; thickening, fibrosis, and calcification of the leaflet cusps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; and thickening, fusion, and shortening of the chordae tendineae. The net effect is transition from a mitral valve that is often regurgitant early in the disease process to a stenotic mitral valve with a symmetric, central, oval-shaped orifice and a classic pattern of &quot;doming&quot; of the leaflets in diastole due to fusion of the leaflet tips at the commissures. The degree of leaflet thickening and calcification and the severity of chordal involvement are variable. </p><p>Commissural fusion and chordal shortening are due to recurrent rheumatic fever with repetitive valve scarring, but leaflet thickening and calcification appear to be primarily due to the stress of chronic turbulent flow through a deformed valve. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation in a study from South Africa that ongoing rheumatic activity was present in 2 percent of patients with pure MS compared with 47 percent of patients with pure mitral regurgitation (MR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Also supportive of this hypothesis is the observation that recurrent stenosis after mitral valvuloplasty, without intervening episodes of rheumatic fever, is due to leaflet thickening and calcification without recurrent commissural fusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>Rheumatic MS has a delayed onset compared to rheumatic MR. The interval between the episode of rheumatic fever and the clinical presentation of MS varies geographically, ranging from as little as a few years in countries with a high prevalence of rheumatic fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/16,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21,22</a>] to 20 years in countries where rheumatic fever is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Most children with RHD have pure MR (as illustrated by series in 12 African countries, India and Yemen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], South Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], Cameroon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and Mozambique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]), with pure MS as well as mixed MS and MR increasing into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

The ensuing acute inflammatory process can lead to commissural adhesion prior to the more common degenerative sequelae. It is therefore not uncommon in some of these countries to see symptomatic MS in patients less than 20 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/8,16,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16,21,22</a>], compared with the typical development of symptoms between the ages of 30 and 50 in developed nations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H185053055\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital MS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital MS is a rare condition that often involves multiple valve components, such as rolled, thickened leaflet margins, hypoplasia or fusion of the papillary muscles (including parachute mitral valve in which the mitral chordae are attached to a single or dominant papillary muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]), and short and thickened chordae tendineae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/12,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,26,27</a>]. Parachute mitral valve is often a component of the Shone complex (which includes other left-sided obstructive lesions such as supramitral ring, valvular aortic stenosis, subaortic stenosis, and aortic coarctation). Atrioventricular canal defects are also associated with an increased risk of parachute mitral valve deformity. Accessory mitral valve tissue is a rare cause of congenital MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects#H6370675\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of atrioventricular (AV) canal defects&quot;, section on 'Partial AV canal defect'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H185053129\"><span class=\"h3\">Mitral annular calcification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitral annular calcification (MAC) develops from progressive calcium deposition along and beneath the mitral valve annulus. MAC generally follows the C-shape of the mitral annulus, so the base of the anterior mitral leaflet is generally (but not always) spared. Although data on the pathophysiology of MAC are very limited, an atherosclerotic process similar to that observed for calcific aortic valve disease has been proposed since atherosclerosis and MAC are strongly associated. Data are relatively sparse on the natural history of MS caused by MAC (also known as senile calcific MS since the prevalence of MAC increases with age). A study of 32 patients observed over a mean of 2.6 years demonstrated progression in mean mitral valve gradient in only half of the subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, in those with progression, the rate of change averaged 2 mmHg per year and changed as rapidly as 9 mmHg per year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of mitral annular calcification&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436311252\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic and structural sequelae</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13121913\"><span class=\"h3\">Altered filling dynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The abnormal filling dynamics of MS are characterized by an increased transmitral pressure gradient. This diastolic pressure gradient is dependent on the severity of MS, cardiac output, and heart rate. In patients with mild to moderate MS, left atrial (LA) pressures are only minimally elevated at rest, but may increase to produce symptoms with exercise or other conditions that increase heart rate such as atrial fibrillation. In more severe forms of MS, LA pressures are usually significantly elevated at rest. The mean transmitral gradient is increased in patients with MS when the cardiac output increases, as in anemic and pregnant patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104280\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104280 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>Progressive MS is associated with a gradual loss of cross-sectional valve area. The normal mitral valve orifice has a cross-sectional area of 4 to 6 cm<sup>2</sup>. In general, a valve area of &lt;2.5 cm<sup>2</sup> must be present before exertional dyspnea can be attributed to MS. A valve area of &lt;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> is usually required to produce symptoms at rest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97546\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97546 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. An orifice area of &le;1 cm<sup>2</sup> is considered to represent severe MS, and is associated with a significant pressure gradient that is necessary to maintain adequate filling of the left ventricle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the mitral valve&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With isolated MS, the left ventricular systolic and diastolic pressures are usually normal. However, when the stenosis is very severe, there may be a decrease in left ventricular filling and end-diastolic volume (ie, preload), leading to reductions in stroke volume and cardiac output. Furthermore, the chronically elevated LA pressure leads to marked atrial remodeling and increased pulmonary venous, capillary, and arterial pressures and resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104283\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104283 \">algorithm 2</a>).

These changes predispose to mechanical complications of LA chamber enlargement, in-situ thrombosis, and atrial fibrillation. An enlarged LA may impinge on the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, causing hoarseness (Ortner&rsquo;s syndrome). </p><p>LA thrombosis is found in 17 to 24 percent of patients undergoing mitral valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], and may be caused not only by stasis due to atrial fibrillation but also by endocardial injury secondary to chronic LA pressure overload. A scanning electronmicroscopy analysis of left and right atrial appendages of 35 patients who required corrective surgery for mitral valve disease showed that advanced changes were more frequently seen in the endocardium of the LA appendage compared with right atrial appendage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Patients with MS had a higher proportion of advanced endocardial changes in the LA appendage compared with patients with MR. Further support for the concept that LA endothelial injury may be a mediator of LA thrombosis in MS independent of atrial fibrillation comes from a study in China that showed that the normalized expression of the von Willebrand factor gene relative to control was 3.04 in the LA appendage from 40 patients with LA thrombus and 2.16 in those without thrombosis (n = 40; p&lt;0.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Other factors such as the shape of the LA may also predispose to an increased risk of LA thrombosis. Data suggest that at comparable volumes, a spherical LA shape had an increased risk for embolic cerebrovascular events compared with an elliptical-shaped LA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436311270\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary hypertension in patients with MS is the direct consequence of chronically elevated pulmonary venous pressures. As a general rule, the pulmonary artery pressure rises passively and maintains a normal or near-normal pulmonary arteriovenous pressure gradient (mean PA pressure minus mean pulmonary venous pressure) of about 10 mmHg. </p><p>In a relatively small but important group of patients with MS, pulmonary hypertension is of a different magnitude and bears little relationship to the LA pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This type of reactive pulmonary hypertension is due to vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] and pathological remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and may be, in part, mediated by the potent vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1). Levels of ET-1 are threefold higher in patients with severe MS compared with healthy control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In a group of patients with severe MS undergoing percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty or mitral valve replacement, the baseline ET-1 concentration was an independent predictor of a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at six months following mitral valve intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>The pulmonary vasculature remodels over time in patients with MS. There appears to be intimal hyperplasia, distal extension of smooth muscle, medial hypertrophy and fibrosis, and adventitial hypertrophy in small pulmonary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Changes are also evident in the small pulmonary veins, capillaries, and lymphatics. Veins may also exhibit thickened and fibrotic media and may be arterialized (ie, elastin fibers are condensed into internal and elastic laminae). The capillaries are often engorged, with thickened basement membranes and the lymphatics are dilated and thicker than normal. Pulmonary venous hypertension also leads to broncho-pulmonary anastomoses, which have been associated with hemoptysis.

There was no decrease in 28 patients, relatively little change (&lt;0.1 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/year)</span> in 40, and more rapid (&ge;0.1 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/year)</span> in 35. The rate of loss of valve area cannot be predicted by initial valve area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>In a study from Israel, investigators followed 36 patients with moderate MS for approximately six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The data suggest that the rate of mitral valve narrowing in patients with moderate MS is variable and cannot be predicted by patient's age, past commissurotomy, valve score, or gradient. Notably, in many patients, the valve area did not change over a long observation period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of the asymptomatic phase of rheumatic MS varies across geographical areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. For example, in North America, it is generally a slowly progressive disease, with a latency period as long as 15 to 40 years between the initial infection and the onset of clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/2,3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,12</a>]. In developing countries, on the other hand, MS progresses much more rapidly, and may lead to symptoms in younger patients, typically in young adults, or in the teenage years, but even in children under five years of age in some countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p>The natural history of rheumatic MS was evaluated in a prospective study of 159 such patients from Germany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean interval between rheumatic fever and the onset of symptoms was 16.3 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At 25 years after the initial episode of rheumatic fever, 8 percent were asymptomatic, 9 percent were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, 33 percent were NYHA class III, and 50 percent were NYHA class IV or had undergone mitral valve surgery.</p><p/><p>Similar findings were noted in an older report in which 49 asymptomatic patients were followed for 20 years: 24 percent remained asymptomatic, 14 percent developed symptoms or atrial fibrillation, and 62 percent died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis dramatically worsens once the patient with MS develops symptoms.

This relationship can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study published in 1962, 271 symptomatic patients with MS were followed for up to 26 years after their initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The 10-year survival rate for patients in functional class I, II, III, and IV was &gt;80, 69, 33, and 0 percent, respectively. At 20 years, 49 percent of patients in class II were still alive compared with no survivors among the patients in class III.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a later report, patients in whom valve surgery was recommended but refused had 5- and 10-year survival rates of 44 and 32 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>Other poor prognostic indicators include the presence of atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] and the progression to severe pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In one series of 586 patients with mitral valve disease, 8.2 percent had severe pulmonary hypertension, defined as a resting systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 80 mmHg or above and pulmonary vascular resistance of 10 Woods units or greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].
