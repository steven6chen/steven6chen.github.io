They present as bossed plaques or exophytic masses located on the head, neck, or limbs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F88800%7EDERM%2F88907\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88800 graphicRef88907 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Based upon their natural history, two major subtypes of CH have been recognized: rapidly involuting congenital hemangiomas (RICHs) and noninvoluting congenital hemangiomas (NICHs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In most cases, RICH involute completely by the age of 14&nbsp;months, whereas NICH never regress but grow in proportion with the child and may require eventual excision. A third intermediate subtype, the so-called partially involuting congenital hemangioma (PICH), shows overlapping features of RICH and NICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>CH will be discussed in this topic.

In a prospective study, RICH occurred in 2 of 594 newborns (0.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a retrospective review of 6459 children with vascular anomalies seen in a vascular anomalies center, CHs were diagnosed in 14 percent, infantile hemangiomas (IHs) in 43 percent, and capillary malformations in 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In contrast with IH, there is no known association between CH and premature birth or multiple gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13843078\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is increasing evidence that most (or perhaps all) congenital hemangiomas (CHs), whether rapidly involuting, noninvoluting, or partially involuting, are due to somatic activating mutations in <em>GNAQ</em> and its paralog <em>GNA11</em>. Mutations that alter glutamine at amino acid 209 (Gln209) in <em>GNAQ</em> or <em>GNA11</em> were found in all tested frozen-tissue samples from eight CHs collected during a clinically indicated procedure, at frequencies ranging from 3 to 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The same mutations were found in three out of seven paraffin-embedded samples. The authors noted that since the same mutations are found in both NICH and RICH, other factors must account for the differing clinical presentations and postnatal behaviors. Mutations in this allele are also common in uveal melanoma and blue nevi and have been shown to constitutively activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Mutations in <em>GNAQ</em> and <em>GNA11</em> are a common cause of port wine stains, but they are typically found in other alleles, such as <em>R183Q</em>. In one case report, an infant with a very large CH, as well as innumerable small vascular tumors, was found to have a <em>GNA11</em> mutation in the same allele in both the large tumor and in two of the smaller tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Two other types of hemangiomas have also been described as being due to Gln209 <em>GNAQ</em> mutations: congenital hepatic hemangiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and anastomosing hemangiomas, a type of vascular tumor with adult onset that occurs mostly in the genitourinary tract and paravertebral soft tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>These genomic findings, together with immunohistochemical differences between CHs and infantile hemangiomas (IHs), confirm that they are distinct entities rather than variants of the same vascular tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. They also suggest that molecular diagnosis will likely extend our understanding of vascular tumors caused by this mutation beyond those classically thought of as being CH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H789775\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both RICH and NICH consist of small to large lobules of capillary proliferations lined by endothelial cells with &quot;hobnailed&quot; nuclei, embedded in a dense fibrous stroma and surrounded by large dysplastic vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89836\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89836 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Focal thromboses and calcifications may be seen; stromal hemosiderin deposits are common. Immunohistochemical staining for glucose transporter protein-1 (GLUT-1) is negative. This finding helps distinguish CH from infantile hemangiomas (IH), whose endothelial cells uniformly express GLUT-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

They present as an abdominal mass in an otherwise healthy infant. Transient thrombocytopenia and anemia are observed in some infants, presumably due to intralesional thrombosis. Arteriovenous shunting may result in heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Although rare, these lesions can lead to instability in some neonates, with progressive liver failure and death. Ultrasonography demonstrates a well-circumscribed vascular mass with large feeding and draining vessels; coarse subcapsular calcifications can be seen after involution. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the lesions are hyperintense on T2 imaging and hypointense on T1 imaging, with postcontrast imaging demonstrating early peripheral enhancement with eventual diffuse enhancement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13843108\"><span class=\"h2\">Noninvoluting congenital hemangiomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NICH are well-circumscribed, round to oval, plaque-like or bossed, soft-tissue masses; the color varies from pink to blue-red or purple [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].
