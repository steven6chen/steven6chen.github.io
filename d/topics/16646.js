Conservative approaches to treatment of SUI include pelvic floor muscle training and incontinence pessaries. However, for women who fail or decline conservative therapy, there are a variety of surgical treatments. Preoperative evaluation of women with SUI helps to exclude other diagnoses and guide the choice of a surgical procedure.</p><p>The preoperative evaluation of women with SUI will be reviewed here. General principles of evaluation of women with urinary incontinence and conservative and surgical treatment of SUI, as well as evaluation of women with recurrent SUI after surgery, are discussed separately.

Loss of the urethra's ability to maintain the required pressure results from anatomic or neurologic defects.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anatomic contribution to continence involves the anterior vaginal wall and overlying connective tissue, which provide the urethra with a stable base upon which to rest (hammock theory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]). Upon an increase in bladder or intraabdominal pressure, the urethra is compressed onto this base, thereby closing the lumen and maintaining urethral pressure. When the support structures are weakened, the urethra loses its underlying support and becomes hypermobile. Thus, the normal mechanism of continence through urethral compression is compromised.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Etiologies of loss of urethral support include <span class=\"nowrap\">pregnancy/childbirth,</span> aging, and repetitive stress on the pelvic floor (eg, repetitive heavy lifting, chronic cough, or obesity). Genetic factors may also contribute to a loss of pelvic support through deficient collagen structure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neurologic component of continence is mediated through both bladder and urethral innervation. The bladder storage and filling phase is controlled through a spinal sympathetic reflex that (1) stimulates beta adrenergic receptors within the bladder wall causing relaxation of the smooth muscle and (2) activates alpha adrenergic receptors in the urethra which contract the urethra and increase its pressure. The urethra is also innervated through efferent pathways from the pudendal nerve, which increases the tone of the pelvic diaphragm and striated urethral sphincter. Pregnancy, childbirth, and aging can result in pudendal neuropathy leading to urinary incontinence.</p><p/><p>The role of pregnancy and childbirth in the development of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is discussed separately.

Typical symptoms of SUI are involuntary urine loss, such as leakage of urine with increased intraabdominal pressure, ie, coughing, sneezing, laughing, or physical exertion. A bladder diary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69130 \">figure 2</a>) can be useful, particularly in patients in whom the etiology of urinary incontinence is uncertain.

A urethral mass could be a urethral diverticulum or, rarely, a neoplasm. A pelvic mass (eg, an anterior uterine leiomyoma) may exert pressure upon the bladder and exacerbate stress urinary incontinence (SUI). If pooling of urine is noted in the vagina, the patient should be evaluated for a urinary tract fistula. In addition, for women who have undergone previous vaginal surgery, the presence or absence of prior surgical materials (eg, suture, mesh) should be noted. The technique for pelvic examination and evaluation for urethral diverticulum and urinary tract fistula are discussed separately.

Instantaneous leakage with cough suggests SUI. Delayed leakage suggests detrusor overactivity incontinence, especially if there is a large flow of leakage that is difficult for the patient to stop.</p><p>The urinary stress test consists of having a patient with a full bladder Valsalva (tense her abdominal muscles) or cough. We routinely have patients present to the office with a full bladder. Alternatively, a patient's bladder can also be filled with sterile water using a catheter. If the bladder is filled, the patient's first bladder sensation and maximum capacity are noted. Maximum capacity in most women is 200 to 300 mL. The technique for performing a urinary stress test is discussed separately.

In our practice, we no longer formally test for urethral hypermobility, since the presence or absence of hypermobility does not appear to change management. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Urodynamic testing'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Choosing a primary surgical procedure&quot;, section on 'Lack of urethral hypermobility and intrinsic sphincter deficiency'</a>.) Historically, the urethral cotton swab test (Q-tip test) was the most common test used to evaluate urethral mobility for gynecologists, while urology used fluoroscopy. However, the cotton swab test has questionable test-retest and interobserver reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. It is not possible to assess the accuracy of this and other tests of urethral hypermobility, since there is no accepted gold standard.</p><p>Some clinicians assess for urethral hypermobility solely by assessing the severity of point Aa prolapse (stage II or higher is a positive test). This approach appears to be most accurate in women with advanced prolapse. Studies have demonstrated that almost all (over 90 percent) women with advanced point Aa prolapse will have a positive cotton swab test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Overall, the role of urethral hypermobility testing is currently limited and unlikely to change management.</p><p>Pelvic sonography is under investigation as a non-invasive alternative for assessing urethral hypermobility, but its role in changing surgical management is currently unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Postvoid residual volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the postvoid residual volume (PVR) is performed to exclude overflow incontinence or other types of voiding dysfunction. To measure the PVR, the patient is asked to start with a full bladder and void as she normally would (without additional effort to fully empty the bladder). The residual urine in the bladder is measured either by catheterization or bladder sonography. Normally, women should be able to void at least 80 percent of the total bladder volume and have residual urine less than 50 cc immediately after voiding. In general, a PVR of greater than 200 cc may be suggestive of voiding dysfunction or detrusor weakness; the range of normal values for PVR and treatment options remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>] (these values may vary in elderly women or those with advanced pelvic organ prolapse). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary tract infection should be excluded in all women with urinary incontinence. If a urine sample has not yet been obtained, it should be obtained by clean catch, or by catheterization if a clean catch sample cannot be obtained. Clinicians may use urinary dipstick testing or urine culture to ensure the patient does not have an active urinary tract infection. In our practice, it is routine to test the urine using a urine dipstick test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Other testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some clinicians ask patient to perform a perineal pad test, ie, collection of urine in a perineal pad for 1 to 24 hours has been used by some clinicians as part of the evaluation of women with SUI. However, we do not use this test in our practice, since it does not impact patient management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">URODYNAMIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urodynamic evaluation is not necessary for many women with uncomplicated stress urinary incontinence (SUI), but certain urodynamic parameters do improve accuracy of predicting individual risks after surgery for uncomplicated SUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The main disadvantages of urodynamic testing are that it is expensive, time-consuming, and causes patient discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Urodynamic testing may be useful when symptoms are not consistent with physical examination findings or in women with complicated incontinence scenarios.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Women with uncomplicated SUI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urodynamic testing does not improve treatment outcomes in women with uncomplicated SUI prior to midurethral sling surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>] but does improve accuracy of predicting a woman's risk of developing urgency urinary incontinence and adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Women with uncomplicated SUI are those who do not have the characteristics of complicated SUI described in the next section.</p><p>There has been considerable debate regarding the diagnostic value and cost-effectiveness of routine urodynamic testing in women with uncomplicated SUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/15,19,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19,23-26</a>]. Two randomized trials have found that management based upon urodynamic testing does not improve treatment outcomes of midurethral sling procedures, which are the most common continence procedures. In one trial (n = 603), women with uncomplicated SUI were assigned to either urodynamic testing or office evaluation prior to SUI treatment (93 percent of women were treated with a midurethral sling) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. At 12-month follow-up, the rate of successful treatment (assessed by questionnaire) was 77 percent in both groups; office evaluation was found to be non-inferior (defined as a difference of less than 11 percent). Women who had urodynamic testing were significantly less likely to receive a diagnosis of overactive bladder and more likely to receive a diagnosis of voiding-phase dysfunction, but this did not result in significant differences in treatment selection or outcomes. In the other trial, women with predominant SUI underwent urodynamics and those in whom urodynamic results were discordant with clinical assessment (n = 126) were assigned to either immediate midurethral sling surgery or treatment guided by urodynamic results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In the urodynamic-guided group, surgery was performed in 92 percent of women initially and in 98 percent by 12 months. The immediate surgery and urodynamic-guided groups both had comparable improvement in a validated symptom inventory at 12 months. &#160;</p><p>The role of urodynamic testing is limited in this patient population. Urodynamic evaluation is not required to confirm the diagnosis of SUI in women with typical SUI symptoms and physical examination findings (urinary stress test consistent with SUI). However, a secondary analysis of data from the Trial of Mid-Urethral slings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] produced several statistical models to predict risk of incontinence and adverse events 12 months after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These models were externally validated and were shown to accurately predict these outcomes after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. While adding several urodynamic parameters into the models increased the accuracy of predicting bothersome urgency urinary incontinence, stress test results, and adverse events in women after surgery, urodynamic parameters were not useful in predicting bothersome SUI. The calculator of de novo SUI is presented in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F103962\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103962 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Mixed urinary incontinence does not impact the choice of surgical procedure, and thus, these women do not require preoperative urodynamic evaluation. As noted above, these women should undergo a trial of pharmacologic therapy prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Choosing a primary surgical procedure&quot;, section on 'Mixed incontinence'</a>.)</p><p>Occult SUI, which refers to SUI that develops after pelvic reconstructive surgery in women with advanced pelvic organ prolapse, can usually be diagnosed by repeating the urinary stress test while the prolapse is reduced by the examiner. This can be performed during pelvic examination in the office setting. However, there is limited evidence that the urinary stress test or urodynamic testing is able to classify patients as having occult SUI after surgery for advanced pelvic organ prolapse. Alternatively, combining a patient&rsquo;s risk factors together with results from the office stress test appears to accurately predict a woman&rsquo;s individual risk of developing occult SUI better than the urinary stress test and an expert&rsquo;s guess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Using the data set (n = 457) from the Outcomes Following Vaginal Prolapse Repair and Midurethral Sling (OPUS) trial, a model containing seven clinical predictors discriminated between de novo SUI status (concordance index 0.73, 95% CI 0.65-0.80) in OPUS participants and outperformed expert clinicians (area under the curve 0.72 compared with 0.62) and preoperative urinary stress testing (area under the curve 0.72 compared with 0.54) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of SUI is made by a combination of history and urinary stress testing. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SUI often coexists with pelvic organ prolapse <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anal incontinence. The preoperative evaluation should include assessment for these conditions, as they may alter surgical decision making. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medical and voiding history are used to ensure that the patient's symptoms are consistent with SUI and to exclude a non-stress etiology of urinary incontinence. A focused medical history is taken to exclude local or systemic conditions that may cause or worsen urinary incontinence, and to assess surgical risk. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Medical and voiding history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During a urinary stress test (cough stress test), instantaneous leakage with cough suggests SUI, while delayed leakage suggests detrusor overactivity incontinence, especially if there is a large flow of leakage that is difficult for the patient to stop. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Urinary stress test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urethral hypermobility is present in most women who have SUI. The clinical value of testing for urethral hypermobility is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H1568119\" class=\"local\">'Assessing urethral mobility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative urodynamics are not necessary for most women with uncomplicated SUI. However, urodynamic testing does improve the accuracy of predicting clinically important outcomes (eg, urgency urinary incontinence and adverse events) after surgery for SUI when combined with an individual woman's characteristics. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Urodynamic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Abrams P, Cardozo L, Fall M, et al.
