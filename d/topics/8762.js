In general, the ovaries are stimulated by a combination of fertility medications and then one or more oocyte(s) are aspirated from ovarian follicles. These are fertilized in the laboratory (&quot;in vitro&quot;), after which, one or more embryo(s) are transferred into the uterine cavity. These steps occur over about a two-week interval of time, which is called an IVF cycle.</p><p>The first pregnancy after the fertilization of a human egg in vitro and the first birth from an in vitro-fertilized embryo were reported in 1976 and 1978 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Since then, an estimated seven million pregnancies have been achieved worldwide by IVF and its modifications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72805 \">table 1</a>), known generically as assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs). As experience has accumulated, success rates have increased, and the indications for these procedures have expanded, ART now accounts for 1 to 3 percent of live births in the United States and Europe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Fertility issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete infertility evaluation should be performed on both partners prior to embarking on IVF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of female infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-male-with-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the male with infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial experience with IVF involved women with tubal disease that could not be surgically corrected. With its efficacy established, IVF has been made available to women with other causes of infertility, including one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubal factor (IVF is primary therapy if tubes are completely blocked)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe male factor infertility (mild male factor may be treated with inseminations; if male factor is severe, IVF is primary therapy of choice)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished ovarian reserve (time to conception is critical and success with other therapies is low)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All other causes of infertility, after failing treatment with less invasive therapies (eg, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, unexplained infertility)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian failure (although donor eggs must be used in this case)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine factor (if severe, such as Asherman syndrome or irreparable distortion of the uterine cavity, gestational surrogacy may be needed in conjunction with IVF)</p><p/><p>Disadvantages of IVF include the high cost, the need for procedures and drugs associated with some risk to the woman, an increased rate of multiple gestation (which accounts for much of the direct cost of pregnancies conceived via IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]), and possibly a slight increase in fetal complications (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy outcome after assisted reproductive technology&quot;</a>). Therefore, alternative treatment options, including observation, should be considered when counseling women with open fallopian tubes and without severe male factor infertility. Although such women may have some indications for IVF (eg, pelvic disease, endometriosis, unexplained fertility, failed <span class=\"nowrap\">gonadotropin/intrauterine</span> insemination therapy), they also have substantial treatment-independent pregnancy rates (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below). In young women, treatable causes of subfertility should be treated prior to initiating IVF because treatment may enhance the likelihood of natural conception. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for female infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, in the absence of absolute impediments for conception (blocked fallopian tubes, severe male factor), couples may be offered three to six cycles of superovulation and intrauterine insemination (IUI) before proceeding to IVF. A reasonable course when counseling young couples with no clear block to conception is to complete a total of one year of unprotected intercourse and one year of conventional treatment, since conception is quite likely during this time (about 85 percent conceive during the first year and a further 50 percent during the second year). A shorter period is generally used in older couples, as conventional treatment is less successful and time plays a much greater role in the probability of conception. It is not unreasonable to offer IVF as a primary treatment option to couples with the female partner over 40 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Younger maternal age'</a> below.)</p><p>IVF has also been used to achieve pregnancy in gestational carriers of women who do not have a uterus or in whom pregnancy is medically contraindicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surrogate-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surrogate pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H460064026\"><span class=\"h3\">Other uses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IVF can be useful in the following clinical settings: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex selection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques for preimplantation sex selection&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic testing&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of mitochondrial disorders &ndash; Two IVF techniques, maternal spindle transfer and pronuclear transfer, are promising new applications of IVF for women with inherited mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which are an important cause of genetic diseases for which there is no effective treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107009\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107009 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. These procedures have been referred to as three-person IVF or three-parent IVF, but this overstates the role of the donor of the enucleated oocyte.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In maternal spindle-chromosomal transfer, the nucleus is removed from a donor egg and replaced with the nucleus from the intended mother&rsquo;s egg. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For pronuclear transfer, both eggs are fertilized, and the nuclear DNA from the mother&rsquo;s fertilized egg is transferred to the fertilized donor egg, from which the donor nuclear DNA has been removed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In 2015, the United Kingdom House of Commons approved regulations to allow transplant of a nucleus from the genetic parent into a donor egg, which is equivalent to mitochondrial donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The procedure is estimated to potentially benefit 150 women in the United Kingdom per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As of 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration was unable to approve the technique for use in humans according to federal law, although an advisory panel recommended approving the procedure for use in male embryos (males do not pass their mitochondria on to the next generation of offspring) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial myopathies: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential correction of germline mutations &ndash; Gene editing of an embryo prior to transfer has the potential to correct heritable mutations that cause significant disease. In a landmark study of human embryos heterozygous for a MYBPC3 mutation that would result in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, CRISPR-Cas9-based targeting technology was used to &quot;induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the mutant paternal allele (that) were predominantly repaired using the homologous wild-type maternal gene instead of a synthetic DNA template&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F114250\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114250 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The cell cycle was modulated to control the timing of the DSBs in order to avoid mosaicism; of the CRISPR-injected embryos, 67 percent were uniformly homologous for the wild-type allele, compared with 47 percent of the control embryos. Thus, with the use of such gene-editing technology, heritable mutations could be reversed and more embryos would be available for transfer in an IVF cycle, compared with the current standard of transferring unaffected embryos as identified by preimplantation genetic diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic testing&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This technology is experimental. Efficacy and safety must be established. CRISPR-Cas9 editing is not as yet 100 percent effective, and often results in mosaic embryos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, off-target gene cleavage means that the editing of one problem could result in a new problem, which could take years to become apparent. Ethical issues that need to be addressed specific to the editing of germ cells include the creation of changes, with unknown outcomes, that will be passed along to future generations as well as the potential use of this technology to select for non-medical traits (ie, creation of &quot;designer babies&quot;). In addition, there is significant concern regarding regulatory oversight; each country will need to determine appropriate applications for this technology should it ever become clinically feasible. As a result of these issues, the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) position statement on human genome editing states &quot;it is inappropriate to perform germline gene editing that culminates in human pregnancy&quot; at this time, although the Society supports continued germ-line research with appropriate oversight and consent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Since it is plausible to use this gene-editing technology on affected individuals, in whom the benefit would outweigh the risks (such as modifying a faulty hemoglobin gene in the bone marrow of individuals affected with inherited anemia syndromes), this technology may be used in those instances sooner than in germ-line modifications.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-cycle factors associated with success</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several preprocedure factors can affect the success of IVF (age, infertility diagnosis, past reproductive-obstetrical history) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Younger maternal age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major determinant of the success of IVF is the age of the woman. Although IVF may largely overcome infertility in younger women, it does not reverse the age-dependent decline in fertility in older women, particularly those over 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In 2012, the percentage of cycles using fresh embryos from non-donor oocytes that resulted in a live birth by maternal age was as follows: younger than 35 (40.7 percent), 35 to 37 (31.3 percent), 38 to 40 (22.2 percent), 41 to 42 (11.8 percent), and &gt;42 (3.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The average age of women undergoing ART in the United States is 36 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>This decrease in success parallels that with other forms of fertility treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In IVF, the diminished success is due both to decreased ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation, resulting in a decreased number of oocytes available for IVF, and a decreased implantation rate per embryo transferred due to poor egg quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In addition, the risk of spontaneous abortion is significantly higher in older women.</p><p>The upper limit for performing IVF without donor eggs is controversial and varies by site, but typically ranges from 41 to 45 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In one series in which IVF with autologous eggs was attempted in women aged 45 to 49 years, 70 of 231 (30 percent) had their cycle cancelled before retrieval, the overall pregnancy rate per retrieval was 21 percent (34 of 161), but only 5 of the 34 pregnancies resulted in live born delivery and all of these were in women 45 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The live birth rate per cycle initiated was 5 of 231 (2.1 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of advanced maternal age on pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Adequate ovarian reserve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol concentrations may help predict the success of the IVF procedure. A high day 3 level is a poor prognostic factor.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated serum FSH concentrations in the early follicular phase (cycle day three) are associated with a poor prognosis for pregnancy after IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, a single measurement may not be sufficient since FSH concentrations fluctuate from cycle to cycle. In one study addressing this issue, 6 percent of women with one elevated day three serum FSH value (&gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL)</span> and several normal values subsequently became pregnant after IVF, whereas no woman with high serum FSH values on two or more occasions later became pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Others have reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A meta-analysis of 21 studies concluded that basal FSH as a screening test to predict either poor ovarian response or nonpregnancy had clinical value only in women with extremely high FSH concentrations for any given assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The utility of this test is limited by the lack of standardization of FSH assays. There is as much as a three-fold difference between FSH measurements on the same serum samples with different FSH assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As a result, marginally elevated serum FSH levels must be interpreted in the context of a given assay, and individual programs must evaluate their own outcomes in the face of specific FSH values in order to appropriately counsel patients. However, very high levels (two or more times the upper range of normal for a given assay) have high negative predictive value.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High day three serum estradiol concentrations are also associated with a poor pregnancy outcome after IVF because they appear to be associated with rapid premature follicle recruitment and reduced oocyte numbers. In one report, no pregnancies occurred in women with a serum estradiol concentration above 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (275 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. As with FSH measurements, estradiol levels vary widely with different assays and must be interpreted accordingly. A high serum estradiol level does not appear to have the same negative prognostic value during subsequent cycles as that associated with high FSH levels on day 3.</p><p/><p>We measure serum FSH and estradiol on cycle day 3 (third day of menstrual bleeding) in all women over the age of 35 years who are contemplating IVF, and we do not start IVF cycles in those with serum FSH concentrations &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> or serum estradiol concentrations &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (367 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span>. </p><p>A variety of other tests are available for measurement of ovarian reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other centers may use one of the following tests to help in selecting women who are likely to have a poor response to IVF: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> challenge test (CCCT), ultrasound assessment of antral follicle count or ovarian volume, exogenous FSH ovarian reserve test (EFORT), or measurement of inhibin B or anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/28-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-38</a>]. No one test has been proven superior to the others. Virtually all ART programs perform some type of ovarian reserve testing; however, the value of performing any of these tests has been questioned, given their limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/27,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,39</a>].</p><p>AMH is a good predictor of poor or excessive ovarian response, but not of live birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. For the ultrasound-based tests, a systematic review concluded that an abnormally low antral follicle count was a better predictor of poor response than ovarian volume, but neither ultrasound-based test was highly predictive of a low chance of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Several studies comparing AMH and ultrasound assessment of antral follicle count (AFC) reported that AMH more strongly correlated with oocyte yield after controlled ovarian stimulation than AFC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. </p><p>Measurement of day 3 FSH and estradiol levels have the advantage of simplicity and cost effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. If the values of repeated FSH measurements are high, other forms of therapy (eg, oocyte donation) should be considered. There appears to be no age-related decline in fertility when oocyte donation is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oocyte donation for assisted reproduction&quot;</a>). Younger women who have a poor ovarian response to exogenous gonadotropins should also be tested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors with a negative effect on success</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627727236\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydrosalpinx</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have consistently shown that the presence of a hydrosalpinx is associated with poor IVF outcome: the live birth rate is one-half that of women without hydrosalpinges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Moreover, randomized trials have demonstrated that salpingectomy prior to IVF in women with hydrosalpinges improves pregnancy rates and, therefore, should be recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Hydrosalpingeal fluid may impair establishment of a successful pregnancy by negatively impacting the transferred embryo or endometrial receptivity. These adverse effects may be mediated by mechanical factors, microorganisms, endotoxins, cytokines, lack of nutrients, oxidative stress, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the woman's genotype (HOXA10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Laparoscopic salpingectomy is the preferred approach and cost-effective in this patient population. Other potentially effective approaches include salpingostomy and hysteroscopic tubal occlusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reproductive-surgery-for-female-infertility#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reproductive surgery for female infertility&quot;, section on 'Salpingectomy before in vitro fertilization'</a>.)</p><p>However, at least one meta-analysis has found evidence of reduced ovarian reserve following salpingectomy. In a meta-analysis of 25 studies comparing women who underwent salpingectomy (one or both tubes) with women who did not have salpingectomy, women who underwent salpingectomy required higher gonadotropin doses, had higher FSH levels (following bilateral salpingectomy), and had fewer oocytes retrieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. As pregnancy and live birth rates were not reported, it is not known if these differences are clinically important. Given the above data demonstrating improved IVF outcomes after removal of hydrosalpinges, we continue to advise salpingectomy for women with hydrosalpinx who require IVF. We make an effort to avoid interrupting the vascular connection between the uterus and the ovary by removing only the fallopian tube and as little of the broad ligament as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627727335\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking reduces IVF success rates (fewer ova retrieved) and is associated with numerous adverse effects on general health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]; we recommend smokers be advised to stop smoking.

The most likely reason for diminished endometrial receptivity is the premature increase in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> that occurs with all forms of ovarian stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>], and leads to an earlier appearance of the window of implantation and a relative degree of embryo-endometrial dyssynchrony [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The magnitude of the effect on endometrial receptivity is not clear, and embryo quality also likely plays a role.

Pituitary gonadotropin production is inhibited, thereby maximizing control of the cycle. Pituitary suppression of LH secretion is important to prevent a surge of endogenous LH prior to full maturation of the cohort of ovarian follicles. In the United States, a daily dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> acetate 0.5 to 1 mg subcutaneously is most commonly used; a single depot injection containing higher doses of the drug is an alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Down-regulation is verified by serum estradiol measurement less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span>. If the GnRH agonist is initiated in the luteal phase of the cycle prior to the IVF cycle, the initial stimulatory effect of the agonist is blocked by the endogenous secretion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> and estradiol. Alternatively, an oral contraceptive can be used prior to the initiation of the IVF cycle in order to time the onset of menses and to block the initial stimulatory effect of the GnRH agonist on pituitary secretion. One regimen uses two weeks of oral contraceptives with the GnRH agonist initiated after one week and used concurrently for one week, then the GnRH agonist is continued alone for another week.</p><p>When stimulation begins, hMG (or FSH, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]) is administered in a dose of 225 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/day</span> subcutaneously to stimulate follicular growth, with the GnRH agonist being continued at a lower dose to prevent a premature surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. The hMG dose is subsequently adjusted according to follicular growth (as determined by transvaginal ultrasonography) and serum estradiol concentrations (an indicator of granulosa cell proliferation). In a &quot;step-down&quot; protocol, the starting dose of gonadotropin is high and this is followed by gradual reductions in dose during the cycle depending on the response. In a &quot;step-up&quot; protocol, the starting dose of gonadotropin is low and is then gradually increased during the cycle depending on the response.</p><p>One meta-analysis evaluated seven randomized trials that compared the effectiveness of hMG versus recombinant FSH following a long down-regulation protocol in IVF&ndash;ICSI cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Use of hMG was associated with a significant increase in live birth rate (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02&ndash;1.38; pooled risk difference 4 percent 95% CI 1&ndash;7 percent). There were no significant differences between the drugs in spontaneous abortion, multiple pregnancy, cancellation, or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome rates. However, because of patient selection issues and the myriad of other factors which influence the outcome of IVF, the issue of hMG versus FSH alone remains controversial, and a definitive advantage of one type of stimulation over the other has not yet been established. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3357294\"><span class=\"h3\">GnRH agonist flare protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who are poor responders to stimulation, the GnRH agonist may be administered in conjunction with ovarian stimulation, so that the initial (agonistic) response of the pituitary can be used for ovarian stimulation. These so-called &quot;flare&quot; protocols are initiated at the time of spontaneous menstruation or after several days or weeks of oral contraceptive pills. One such regimen uses a low-dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a>, 40 mcg twice daily, started on day 3 of bleeding or three to five days after the last oral contraceptive pill. This regimen is called a &quot;microdose Lupron flare&quot; and is most often combined with 450 international units of FSH or hMG. The leuprolide provides additional stimulation to the growing follicles, and subsequently prevents premature LH surges, as down-regulation is complete by day 5 of stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p>Use of FSH with recombinant LH versus FSH alone has also been studied. In a meta-analysis of these two approaches in women &ge;35 years of age undergoing ART (long protocol: five trials, GnRH antagonist: one trial, microdose flare: one trial), the combination of FSH and recombinant LH resulted in a higher implantation rate (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05-1.78) and clinical pregnancy rate (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.03-1.83) in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. In five of the trials, the recombinant LH dose was 150 U beginning on cycle day 6 or 7. This study supports the concept that LH in combination with FSH improves ovarian stimulation as compared with FSH alone; this is consistent with the meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>] that suggested hMG is superior to FSH, since hMG contains both FSH and LH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356171\"><span class=\"h3\">GnRH antagonist (short) protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GnRH antagonists result in more rapid pituitary desensitization than GnRH agonists. If a GnRH antagonist is used, then no pretreatment with an agonist is necessary. Stimulation is begun either at the time of menses (&quot;short protocol&quot;) or after a variable pretreatment period with oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. An antagonist is administered when the follicles are large (typically &gt;14 mm in greatest diameter) and the risk of premature ovulation first threatens cycle cancellation. Alternatively, some programs first administer the GnRH antagonist on a particular cycle day, usually day 7. Daily injections of the antagonist are then continued until hCG administration. One meta-analysis found that, compared to a long GnRH agonist protocol, use of GnRH antagonists reduced the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome by nearly 40 percent (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.72; absolute risk reduction 3 percent), with no difference in the live birth rates (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 5o 1.23) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356269\"><span class=\"h3\">Triggers for ovulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the ovarian follicles are judged to be mature (two or more follicles with a mean diameter of 18 mm or more and a serum estradiol level of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [734 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L]</span> per co-dominant follicle), a trigger is administered to initiate the ovulatory cascade. </p><p>Both urinary and recombinant hCG preparations are available to trigger ovulation.

A dose of 250 mcg of recombinant hCG appears to be equivalent to the standard doses of urinary hCG (5000 to 10,000 units) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>One of the concerns with hCG administration is the associated risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see below), due in part to the long half-life of hCG. Recombinant human LH (15,000 to 30,000 IU), which has a shorter half-life, has been compared to hCG (5,000 IU) as the ovulatory trigger in 259 women undergoing IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. An LH dose between 15 and 30,000 IU was as effective as hCG for number of oocytes retrieved, embryo number, and clinical pregnancy, and recombinant LH was associated with a significantly lower risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome than hCG. </p><p>GnRH agonists have also been used for ovulation triggering. In the United States, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> acetate is generally used, in doses of 1 to 4 mg, given in a single injection or in two doses 12 hours apart. The pituitary responds with a surge of LH, and therefore cannot be down-regulated with the GnRH agonist during earlier phases of the cycle. Thus, this method is generally only used in association with the GnRH antagonist protocol. In our practice, we give 4 mg of leuprolide acetate 35 hours prior to retrieval followed by a second dose 12 hours later. A 2014 meta-analysis concluded that ovulation triggering with GnRH agonists was associated with significantly lower pregnancy and live birth rates than hCG trigger with a fresh embryo transfer, although the rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was also less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].

Success has also been achieved with sperm obtained from the epididymis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>] or directly from the testis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, in couples without male factor infertility, IVF with ICSI offers no clinical advantage when compared with conventional IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/134,135\" class=\"abstract_t\">134,135</a>]. One retrospective study reported that ICSI use in cycles for couples without male factor infertility (n = 317,996) was associated with lower rates of implantation (23 versus 25 percent) and live birth (36.5 versus 39.2 percent) when compared with conventional IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>]. Thus, ICSI should be reserved for those with severe male factor infertility or previously failed fertilization.

After fertilization, the individual cells of each embryo (&quot;blastomeres&quot;) divide every 12 to 14 hours, so that the embryo reaches approximately 8 cells by 72 hours after egg retrieval. Embryos between days 2 and 4 are called &quot;cleavage stage embryos.&quot; The blastocyst stage is reached by about day 5 after retrieval, and implantation is expected by day 7 after egg retrieval, so transfer should take place prior to this time. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Embryo transfer'</a> below.)</p><p>&quot;Hatching&quot; is a natural process in which an embryo expands and eventually breaks through the zona pellucida in order to implant on the surface of the endometrium (the lining of the uterus). &quot;Assisted hatching&quot; refers to a laboratory procedure whereby the zona pellucida around the day 3 embryo is mechanically or chemically opened to assist the embryo in hatching from the zona about three days later. The procedure may improve the percentage of embryos that implant in selected cases with poor prognosis (eg, &ge;2 failed IVF cycles and poor embryo quality and older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/139,140\" class=\"abstract_t\">139,140</a>]), but its value remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/140,141\" class=\"abstract_t\">140,141</a>].</p><p>If preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is planned, embryonic DNA must be obtained from the embryo by removing one or more blastomeres from the embryo (&quot;embryo biopsy&quot;). In the past, embryo biopsy was performed at the cleavage stage, about 72 hours after oocyte aspiration. Embryo culture was then continued while the biopsied blastomere was analyzed and until embryo transfer. Most recently, embryo biopsy has been delayed to the blastocyst stage, when the embryonic cells have differentiated into the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm. Embryo biopsy is now trophectoderm biopsy. Because embryo transfer has to take place by day 6, there is limited time for diagnosis prior to transfer, and biopsied blastocysts are commonly cryopreserved for transfer during a subsequent cycle.

After [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/142,143\" class=\"abstract_t\">142,143</a>] fertilization, embryos are maintained in culture for a variable period of time prior to transfer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleavage stage: Most programs (52 percent) transfer embryos to the uterus about 72 hours after egg retrieval (four to eight cell, cleavage stage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. While a meta-analysis of 12 trials did not find a difference in live-birth, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy rates between day 2 and day 3 embryo transfers, the additional 24 hours in culture from day 2 to day 3 allows identification of embryos that stop dividing and thus are not viable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blastocyst stage: Day 5 transfer (blastocyst stage) is the next most common time for transfer (36 percent of procedures). Major advantages of blastocyst stage transfer are the ability to perform PGD and the large reduction in multiple gestation with single blastocyst transfer.</p><p/><p>The rationale for blastocyst transfer is that per cycle live birth rates as high or higher than with cleavage stage transfer can be achieved with transfer of fewer (one or two) blastocysts, which substantially decreases the rate of high order multiple pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>]. Cumulative live birth rates are not improved. Although delaying the transfer until the blastocyst stage allows selection of better quality embryos for transfer and transfer at the time a naturally fertilized in vivo embryo reaches the uterine cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F85802\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85802 \">figure 5</a>), the live birth rate per oocyte retrieval may not improve because fewer embryos are available for transfer due to loss of embryos that did not survive in vitro to day 5.

There is also some low quality evidence that some pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, may be adversely affected by extended embryo culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>].

The transcervical route is the easiest and the least traumatic to the woman. The type of catheter (soft versus hard) and other aspects of the transfer technique, such as use of ultrasound guidance, can affect the success of transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/154-158\" class=\"abstract_t\">154-158</a>]. However, operator experience remains a major factor in the success of the procedure, and details of the technique must be adapted to each patient on an individual basis. </p><p>All of the embryos that are to be transferred are loaded into the transfer catheter at one time in a volume of about 20 microliters. Under ultrasound guidance, they are placed 1 to 2 cm from the top of the uterine cavity. Touching the catheter to the top of the cavity or otherwise inducing uterine cramping by a traumatic transfer technique is thought to decrease the success of the procedure.</p><p>Post-procedure, the catheter is checked to ensure there are no retained embryos. Although there is a theoretic possibility of losing embryos out of the cervix or into the fallopian tubes after embryo transfer, randomized trials have not found that bedrest post-transfer improves the implantation rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>]; nevertheless, it is commonly recommended. Available evidence also does not support use of a fibrin sealant or other types of &quot;embryo glue&quot; post-embryo transfer improve clinical pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>].</p><p>The usual number of embryos transferred depends on a number of factors, including maternal age, the number of oocytes retrieved and availability of embryos for cryopreservation. Transferring more than one embryo increases the chance for a pregnancy, but also increases the chance of multiple gestation. No more than two embryos should be transferred in young women. Since the rate of implantation is lower among older women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59373 \">table 2</a>), more embryos are often implanted except for those women receiving oocytes from younger donors. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine suggests that no more than three or four embryos be transferred in 38 to 40 year-olds and no more than five embryos be transferred in women 41 years of age or older (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F112844\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112844 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>]. However, this is controversial, and some authors suggest transfer of no more than two embryos regardless of maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. Patient-specific factors are important; cycles that result in a high number of oocytes and yield a large number of embryos for cryopreservation are associated with higher pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/162,163\" class=\"abstract_t\">162,163</a>]. </p><p>Some countries have restricted by law the number of embryos that may be transferred at one time.

With newer vitrification methods, survival rates above 90 percent are expected. Despite these losses, systematic reviews of observational studies have found that children born after transfer of frozen-thawed embryos have better perinatal outcomes than those born after transfer of fresh embryos (ie, lower rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, growth restriction, perinatal mortality), and they have comparable malformation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/86,184-187\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,184-187</a>]. Outcome data on growth, childhood morbidity, and mental development are limited, but have reported few differences between groups.

The lower serum E2 levels associated with frozen-thawed embryo and donor egg transfer cycles may result in better placentation. It is also possible that embryos that survive freezing and thawing are of better quality than fresh embryos. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation'</a> above.)</p><p>Based on improved obstetric outcomes with frozen-thawed embryos, some experts have proposed freeze-all cycles, in which all embryos are frozen for future use in a cycle that is not linked to ovarian hyperstimulation. In a meta-analysis of four trials including nearly 1900 women that compared the outcomes of the freeze-all strategy with conventional <span class=\"nowrap\">IVF/CISI</span> strategies with fresh embryos, the live birth rates were similar for the two approaches (odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.91-1.31) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/189\" class=\"abstract_t\">189</a>]. The meta-analysis did not assess for obstetric complications or birth outcomes other than live birth.</p><p>Two subsequent larger trials also reported that, for ovulatory women with infertility, the live birth rate did not appear to differ following transfer of frozen-thawed or fresh embryos, which further supports use of freeze-all cycles. In a multicenter Chinese trial including over 2000 ovulatory women undergoing their first cycle of IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection, there were no differences in the rates of live birth (49 and 50 percent), implantation (41 versus 42 percent), clinical pregnancy (54 versus 57 percent), overall pregnancy loss (9 versus 11 percent), and ongoing pregnancy (50 versus 53 percent) among frozen-thawed or fresh embryo transfer cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/190\" class=\"abstract_t\">190</a>]. Frozen-thawed embryo transfer was also associated with a lower risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome compared with fresh embryo transfer (0.6 versus 2 percent). Similarly, a Vietnamese trial of over 780 women with infertility, but without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), reported no differences in the ongoing pregnancy (36 versus 35 percent) and live birth rates (34 versus 32 percent) among women receiving frozen-thawed or fresh embryos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/191\" class=\"abstract_t\">191</a>]. In these studies, the indications for IVF were tubal factor, male factor, both tubal and male factors, and other; the percentages of each differed between the two studies. These results appear to differ from those in women with PCOS.

In the largest trial that included over 1500 infertile women with PCOS, frozen-embryo transfer was associated with a higher frequency of live birth (49 versus 43 percent), lower frequency of pregnancy loss (22 versus 33 percent), and lower incidence of OHSS (1 versus 7 percent) compared with fresh-embryo transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/195\" class=\"abstract_t\">195</a>]. The difference in live birth rates was largely attributable to the lower rate of pregnancy loss in women with frozen-embryo transfer, an unusual finding in this type of comparison. The difference in pregnancy loss and live birth rates between the groups was hypothesized to have been mediated by differences in endometrial receptivity between frozen and fresh cycles. Frozen-embryo transfer was also associated with an increased frequency of preeclampsia (4 versus 1 percent), although none of the women had severe preeclampsia. Two stillbirths and five neonatal deaths occurred in women with frozen-embryo pregnancies compared with no stillbirths or neonatal deaths in women with fresh-embryo pregnancies. There were no differences between groups in other types of pregnancies (eg, ectopic or chemical), pregnancy-related complications, or congenital anomalies. </p><p>Of note, the study protocol differed from standard IVF practice in the United States (US) in that the embryos were cryopreserved on day 3 of culture and multiple embryos were transferred, whereas most US programs cryopreserve on day 5 and transfer a single embryo. In addition, the mean body mass index (BMI) of the women studied was 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> which is much lower than the BMI of women with PCOS in other countries. While it is premature to advocate routine frozen-embryo transfer in women with PCOS, it is reassuring that there did not appear to be any adverse effects from this approach and there was a clear benefit from a reduction in OHSS.

Neither physical activity nor diet has been shown to have an impact upon the success of embryo implantation or conception. However, most programs recommend some form of rest or decreased physical activity after the embryo transfer. Since the cervix is swabbed prior to embryo transfer, some women may pass a small amount of clear or bloody fluid from the vagina shortly after the procedure; this is normal and not a sign that the embryos are being expelled. Breast tenderness and engorgement, bloating, and constipation are not uncommon; they are due to the elevated hormone levels associated with ovarian stimulation, and, to a lesser extent, due to the supplemental hormones used for luteal phase support. Cramping during embryo transfer may be caused by touching the inside of the uterus with the transfer catheter. Cramping after the procedure is likely due to varying degrees of ovarian enlargement and the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).</p><p>Mild cramping and bloating are normal; however, patients with moderate or severe pain require evaluation to rule out infection, ovarian torsion, other causes of abdominal pain (such as appendicitis), and more severe forms of OHSS, which is the most common cause of such pain. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>Differentiating OHSS from other causes of abdominal pain can be challenging. Diffuse abdominal tenderness and elevations in the white blood cell count are common to several conditions. Doppler ultrasound may help differentiate ovarian enlargement due to OHSS from ovarian torsion. When pregnancy is diagnosed, rising levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced by the pregnancy further stimulate the enlarged ovaries, and worsen symptoms of OHSS. It is helpful to remember that pain from ectopic pregnancy is uncommon prior to 5 weeks of gestational age (three weeks after follicle aspiration). In cases of severe pain, laparoscopy may be needed to help determine the exact cause and to rule out ovarian torsion or appendicitis.</p><p>Pelvic pain occurring weeks after IVF should be evaluated as in any woman with acute pain.

Implantation is thought to occur no earlier than seven days after retrieval; hCG levels may be detected one or two days later. However, late implantations do occur, so the first blood test is usually obtained no earlier than 12 days after egg retrieval, although some programs start testing later. HCG administration prior to oocyte retrieval results in serum hCG levels between 60 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL,</span> but this hCG is generally completely cleared by two weeks after administration, which is about 12 days after retrieval, so it should not interfere with pregnancy testing. Serial hCG measurements are performed to monitor whether the rise is normal and consistent with a developing intrauterine pregnancy.</p><p>If the hCG test is positive, ultrasound evaluation of the pregnancy generally begins at six weeks of gestational age (four weeks after retrieval), which is when the fetal heartbeat may first be detected. The patient is usually referred for obstetrical care at any time after that, but continued contact is worthwhile for the rare case of heterotopic pregnancy that may occur after IVF, and which may not become apparent until later in the first trimester. The major symptom is pelvic pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-pregnancy-cesarean-scar-pregnancy-and-heterotopic-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal pregnancy, cesarean scar pregnancy, and heterotopic pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, a very early positive hCG test becomes negative on follow-up testing and before there is evidence of an intrauterine or extrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound. Menses often occur at the expected time. These very early pregnancy losses are termed &quot;chemical pregnancies&quot;.</p><p>Vaginal bleeding after diagnosis of pregnancy is of concern, but is not necessarily a poor prognostic sign.

The patient is instructed to stop luteal phase supplementation, and menstruation commonly occurs after one to three days. Lack of menses or unusual irregular bleeding should be evaluated with hormonal measurements, since ectopic pregnancies may rarely present with very delayed appearance of hCG in the circulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OHSS is a potentially life-threatening complication of ovulation induction that can occur in the setting of ovulation induction with exogenous gonadotropin therapy or IVF. Its most severe manifestations include massive ovarian enlargement and multiple cysts, hemoconcentration, and third-space accumulation of fluid; these changes rarely lead to renal failure, hypovolemic shock, thromboembolic episodes, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and (rarely) death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/203-205\" class=\"abstract_t\">203-205</a>].

Nearly 47 percent of ART procedures that progressed to the transfer stage resulted in pregnancy and 38 percent resulted in a live birth. On a per-cycle basis, because of the transfer of multiple embryos, the results of IVF treatment now exceed the fecundability of natural conception cycles in the general population (live births per natural cycle 27.7 percent). Life-table analyses from the early phase of IVF showed that the per cycle pregnancy rate stayed relatively constant for at least six cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/221,222\" class=\"abstract_t\">221,222</a>], although subsequent data suggested a slight decline in the rate after three to four cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/63,223\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,223</a>].

Further, the equal birth rate between groups suggests that any intrauterine pathology not identified by routine ultrasound is clinically insignificant. Of note, this trial contrasts with a prior systematic review suggesting that routine hysteroscopy improved the live birth rate for women with recurrent unsuccessful IVF cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/229\" class=\"abstract_t\">229</a>]. However, the systematic review included five single-center studies, of which only two were randomly assigned trials. For clinicians, the deciding factor on performing hysteroscopy may be the availability of high-quality ultrasound. In areas where ultrasound is of limited quality or availability, hysteroscopy may be preferred. </p><p>For women with recurrent unsuccessful IVF cycles, embryo quality is typically the limiting factor, particularly for women with a normal uterine cavity, adequate endometrial development, and straightforward embryo transfer procedure.

In our practice, we counsel patients that there are several known factors which predispose women to the development of ovarian malignancies: infertility, the presence of endometriosis, and lack of childbearing, all of which are either an inherent part of the diagnosis of infertility or are associated with the diagnosis of infertility. The studies that have linked ovarian cancer to IVF or other fertility treatment have generally found that when these predisposing conditions are taken into account, that the treatment associated increase in risk of ovarian cancer disappears.</p><p>Although a 2013 meta-analysis that included over 746,000 women reported a positive association between IVF and risk of ovarian cancer (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.24-2.03), the increased risk estimate was not statistically significant in some subgroup analyses (eg, women followed for more than eight years; after exclusion of women diagnosed within one year of the IVF treatment; when subfertile women who did not undergo IVF were used as the control group), which makes the risk determination less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/231\" class=\"abstract_t\">231</a>].</p><p>Observational studies suggest the risk of borderline ovarian tumors may be increased in women treated with ovarian stimulating drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a>, gonadotropin) for infertility, including the subgroup of these women undergoing IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/in-vitro-fertilization/abstract/232,236\" class=\"abstract_t\">232,236</a>].

Limitations of the data include that IVF protocols have evolved to use reduced amounts of gonadotropins, include regimens with GnRH antagonists, and typically require fewer cycles. Therefore, it is not known how well these study results apply to contemporary IVF treatment. Additionally, there are limited data on women age &gt;60 years. Despite these limitations, the results are encouraging that there is no large increase in breast cancer risk for women treated with IVF.</p><p>While reproductive hormones appear to have a relationship with breast cancer risk, this relationship is complicated because of multiple confounders.

The oocytes are fertilized in the laboratory, after which, one or more embryo(s) are transferred into the uterine cavity. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Follicle aspiration and fertilization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Embryo management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important procedure-related factors affecting success are the number of oocytes retrieved and the number of high quality embryos derived from them in the laboratory. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fertilized embryos in excess of those that can be safely transferred can be cryopreserved indefinitely for future use. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Cryopreservation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On a per-cycle basis, because of the transfer of multiple embryos, the results of IVF treatment now slightly exceed the fecundability of natural conception cycles in the general population. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major reason for failure to achieve pregnancy with IVF is lack of implantation due to poor embryo quality, poor endometrial receptivity, or poor embryo transfer efficiency.
