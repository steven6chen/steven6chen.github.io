We suggest augmentation for never or ex-smokers age 18 or older with an AAT genetic variant consistent with severe AAT deficiency, a low serum level of AAT (ie, &lt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> or &lt;57 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> and evidence of airflow limitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F112788\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112788 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum AAT level</strong> &ndash; Most patients with PI*ZZ (protease inhibitor Z) or PI*Null genetic variants have a plasma AAT level &lt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or &lt;57 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (nephelometry) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57264\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57264 \">table 2</a>). For other genetic variants, the same range of serum levels (&lt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> or &lt;57 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> is considered the minimum &quot;protective threshold,&quot; and these serum levels should be used as a guide for considering augmentation therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severity of airflow limitation</strong> &ndash; The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease guidelines suggest that the most suitable patients for augmentation have severe AAT deficiency and an forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 35 to 65 percent of predicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The rationale for selecting this range of FEV<sub>1</sub> is that AAT deficient patients with a higher FEV<sub>1</sub> may not develop clinically evident emphysema. The American Thoracic Society suggests weekly augmentation therapy with human pooled AAT for individuals who have plasma levels of AAT less than 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> and established airflow obstruction, defined as an FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;80 percent predicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In comparison, the Canadian Thoracic Society suggests reserving AAT augmentation therapy for AAT-deficient patients (AAT level less than 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> with an FEV<sub>1</sub> of 25 to 80 percent predicted who have quit smoking and are on optimal medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our practice, if the FEV<sub>1</sub> is &gt;65 percent of predicted, but declines by &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/year</span> in an AAT deficient patient, we initiate augmentation therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A lower limit of FEV<sub>1</sub> below which augmentation therapy should be withheld has not been determined, although available studies do not demonstrate clinical efficacy as measured by FEV<sub>1</sub> in patients with severe airflow obstruction (eg, FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;35 percent predicted). Advocates suggest that defending against any decrement in lung function is important in these patients. On the other hand, opponents suggest that established, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lessens the benefit of augmentation therapy and that the efficacy of therapy in preventing loss of the little remaining FEV<sub>1</sub> is negligible. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evidence of emphysema on HRCT</strong> &ndash; Though some disagree, guidelines suggest including chest computed tomography to identify emphysema as part of the initial assessment of the AAT deficient patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In clinical trials, sensitive measures of lung density by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) have demonstrated decreases in lung density over time in patients with severe AAT deficiency. In addition, some patients have HRCT evidence of emphysema without airflow limitation on spirometry. In the absence of data to support initiation of AAT augmentation in this setting, our approach is to follow these patients closely (eg, every six months) with spirometry in order to identify early or progressive declines in FEV<sub>1 </sub>(eg, &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/year),</span> at which time augmentation therapy can be begun.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Additional selection criteria</strong> &ndash; Anticipated adherence to the protocol for weekly infusions may contribute to the decision about initiating augmentation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Guidelines suggest augmentation for patients with necrotizing panniculitis in association with AAT deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Heterozygous individuals with the PiMZ or PiMS genetic variants are generally not candidates for AAT augmentation, as they are not at increased risk for panacinar emphysema in the absence of smoking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3016556027\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretreatment preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who meet criteria for AAT augmentation, we obtain a baseline serum IgA level (as all commercial preparations of AAT augmentation therapy contain some IgA and patients with severe deficiency of IgA are at risk of anaphylaxis with infusion of pooled human AAT). We also obtain baseline spirometry and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (within a year of initiation). </p><p>Selective immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency (&lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> affects approximately 0.1 to 1 percent of the population. A minority of patients with undetectable IgA in plasma form antibodies to IgA that can be associated with systemic reactions to pooled human plasma containing IgA. We avoid AAT augmentation in these patients, due to concerns about anaphylaxis. Consultation with an <span class=\"nowrap\">allergy/immunology</span> specialist and measurement of a serum antibodies to IgA can help define the risk of anaphylaxis due to IgA sensitivity in individual patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis#H6475461\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective IgA deficiency: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Reactions to blood products'</a>.) </p><p>Vaccination against hepatitis A and B for those who are not already immune can help prevent superimposed insults to the liver, but is not necessary prior to AAT augmentation therapy, due to the low risk of transmission. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4055938319\"><span class=\"h2\">Formulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four pooled human plasma AAT products are available, Aralast NP, Prolastin-C, Zemaira, and Glassia. The first three are supplied in a powdered, lyophilized form and the last as a liquid. For the lyophilized preparations, the directions for reconstitution provided in the package insert should be followed closely. After reconstitution, pooled AAT should be used within three hours. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved regimen for AAT is 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight, given as weekly infusions. Studies have shown that weekly infusions of human pooled AAT at a dose of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> maintain AAT levels in plasma and epithelial lining fluid above the protective threshold, both throughout the week and over the long-term (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68873\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68873 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/abstract/1,2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,12</a>]. Serum levels are more consistently above the protective threshold with weekly than biweekly or monthly therapy, although differences in clinical outcomes have not been formally assessed. </p><p>Although effective, weekly infusions can be difficult for patients and support staff. To reduce the frequency of treatment, the efficacy of giving larger doses biweekly has been studied. In a series of 23 patients, simply doubling the dose of AAT to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> was not sufficient to maintain the plasma level above 70 or 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Pharmacokinetic modeling suggested that a dose of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> could be required for biweekly infusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>In comparison, monthly infusions of 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> appear biochemically effective. In one study of nine patients with AAT deficiency (eight PI*ZZ and one PI*Z null), monthly infusions of human pooled AAT at a dose of 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (ie, four times the weekly infusion dose) effectively raised plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) AAT levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79807\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79807 \">figure 2</a>), as well as anti-neutrophil elastase activity, above the protective thresholds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This effect was maintained until the next dose and over the long-term. This study was subsequently extended as monthly infusions were given for up to 24 months in eight severely deficient patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

As noted above, weekly infusions of AAT 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is the only FDA-approved regimen. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Dosing'</a> above.)</p><p>The infusion rate is typically 0.08 to 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> body weight per minute, depending on the individual preparation, such that the average weekly infusion takes 15 minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52673\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52673 \">table 1</a>). Emergency equipment (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>) should be immediately available during the infusion.

As some severely deficient patients have normal lung function, it is apparent that plasma levels alone do not predict disease, but only assign a risk for developing disease. Ideally, outcomes such as mortality, exacerbations, exercise tolerance, quality of life, and lung function would be used to assess efficacy.

Chronic liver disease was noted on biopsy in 20 of 23 patients and two patients met criteria for severe liver disease.

Most transplant centers do not give augmentation therapy to AAT deficient lung transplant recipients, as it is not known whether it would improve outcomes or longevity during the patient's lifetime, and recurrent emphysema is unlikely to occur for 30 to 40 years in the absence of smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency/abstract/45,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,48</a>]. </p><p>In our practice, we observe lung function after transplant and initiate augmentation only if the patient has persistent lung function decline.

(See <a href=\"#H1644082995\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care and standard medical therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical therapy with bronchodilators (eg, beta agonists and anticholinergic agents) and inhaled or oral glucocorticoids should follow guidelines for COPD.

Indications for use of AAT augmentation outside these thresholds for airflow limitation have not been agreed upon. (See <a href=\"#H3522025352\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the majority of patients receiving AAT augmentation, pooled human AAT is administered intravenously 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight, per week. The rate of infusion depends on the specific preparation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52673\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52673 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2193492131\" class=\"local\">'Infusion'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4055938319\" class=\"local\">'Formulations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pooled human plasma AAT contains small amounts of IgA. Rare systemic anaphylactic reactions to pooled human plasma AAT have been reported, possibly due to antibodies to IgA in IgA deficient individuals. (See <a href=\"#H3016556027\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment preparation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The experience with lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) for patients with AAT deficiency is limited, but thus far LVRS has not been shown to improve survival or substantially improve lung function compared with medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Lung volume reduction surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung transplantation is reserved for patients with advanced emphysema due to severe AAT deficiency. Similarly, liver transplantation is reserved for patients with end-stage hepatic disease. After liver transplantation, the AAT deficiency is corrected, because the normal phenotype donor liver produces and secretes AAT.
