Prolonged delays in oral feeding can compromise postoperative nutrition, which can lead to greater postoperative catabolism, poor wound healing, susceptibility to infection, and the need for nutritional support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

A more effective overall strategy is to prevent postoperative ileus by minimizing risk factors that may precipitate and exacerbate the condition. Risk factors for prolonged postoperative ileus are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-ileus#H547643135\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative ileus&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547645413\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTIVE AND POTENTIALLY EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several measures are effective for minimizing the duration of postoperative gastrointestinal dysmotility following abdominal surgery. The use of midthoracic epidural catheters for postoperative pain control, minimally invasive techniques rather than open surgery, reducing the use of opioid agents, gentle surgical technique, chewing gum, and use of multimodal fast-track programs for postoperative care are suggested. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enhanced-recovery-after-colorectal-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enhanced recovery after colorectal surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547645419\"><span class=\"h2\">Midthoracic epidural</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative epidural anesthesia continued into the postoperative period for pain control is an effective means for accelerating the return of gastrointestinal transit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The use of neuraxial local anesthetic agents has the advantages of blocking nociceptive spinal sensory afferents and inhibiting sympathetic efferent outflow. To be effective, epidural catheters should be placed at the midthoracic level to block nociceptive afferent signals from the surgical site and should be used for 48 to 72 hours postoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-ileus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative ileus&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal dysmotility'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The effectiveness of this approach is best illustrated in a 2016 Cochrane review that included 128 trials comparing epidural local anesthetics with opioid-based regimen for adults undergoing abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An epidural with a local anesthetic accelerated the return of flatus by approximately 17 hours (high-quality evidence based on 22 studies) and bowel movement by 22 hours (low-quality evidence based on 28 studies). An epidural with a local anesthetic and an opioid improved pain scores for both open and laparoscopic surgeries; adding an opioid to the solution of local anesthetic did not negatively affect gastrointestinal transit. In patients undergoing open, but not laparoscopic, surgery, an epidural containing a local anesthetic reduced the length of hospital stay by one day (very-low-quality evidence based on 34 studies). In some patients, epidural anesthesia can cause urinary retention or interfere with ambulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H795595600\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and opioids'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547645425\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimally invasive surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimally invasive surgical approaches are performed through small incisions and are associated with a decreased incidence of postoperative ileus. Experiments in animals have shown that the length of laparotomy incision significantly influences postoperative gastrointestinal motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This may be related to the correlation between incision length and postoperative inflammatory response (eg, longer length correlates with greater inflammatory response). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-ileus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative ileus&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal dysmotility'</a>.) </p><p>Most randomized trials in the gastrointestinal and gynecologic literature have shown that laparoscopy facilitates quicker resolution of postoperative gastrointestinal dysmotility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. On the other hand, not all studies have reproduced these results in a clinically meaningful fashion, and this is confounded by several factors, including decreased postoperative opioid use and a tendency toward earlier postoperative feeding after laparoscopic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547645431\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alvimopan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Alvimopan</a>, an oral peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor (PAM-OR) antagonist that has a limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], appears to hasten postoperative gastrointestinal recovery after bowel surgery and abdominal hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. In a review of six trials, alvimopan had a consistent benefit across several endpoints, including time to first passage of stool, tolerance of regular diet, and length of hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, methodologic and reporting deficiencies were identified in the majority of these trials, and whether alvimopan has a clinically meaningful benefit remains to be determined.</p><p>Concerns for an increased risk for cardiovascular or neoplastic complications led the US Food and Drug Administration to limit the indications and dispensing conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Rather than general usage for postoperative ileus, the indication is specified as to accelerate the time to upper and lower gastrointestinal recovery following partial large or small bowel resection surgery with primary anastomosis. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alvimopan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alvimopan</a> is restricted to inpatient use in hospitals that meet criteria for staff training and outcome assessment.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylnaltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methylnaltrexone</a>, another PAM-OR, is also under investigation for treatment of opioid-induced gut dysfunction and constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier and has no antianalgesic effect. Although approved in the United States for use in opioid-induced constipation, two phase III trials evaluating use of methylnaltrexone for postoperative ileus found no improvement in recovery of gastrointestinal function or time to hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547645437\"><span class=\"h2\">Limiting opioid use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioids contribute to postoperative gastrointestinal dysmotility by diminishing normal coordinated gastrointestinal movement. Limiting opioid consumption by using alternative agents (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, preemptive analgesia) to control perioperative pain may help to prevent prolonged postoperative ileus.

We have found this to be especially useful in patients for whom prolonged or continuous NSAID use needs to be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H88573095\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Intravenous acetaminophen'</a>.)</p><p>Preemptive analgesia, an analgesic treatment to prevent the establishment of central sensitization, must be initiated before the surgical injury and maintained postoperatively to prevent the inflammatory changes associated with postinjury hypersensitivity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Preventive analgesia'</a>.)</p><p>Various other agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> (and its successor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, have been reported to possess antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic properties and to reduce the use of postoperative opioids. Although the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents that inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) also possess these properties, they are associated with higher rates of anastomotic leak following gastrointestinal surgery, and we do not recommended their extraordinary use solely for preventing prolonged postoperative ileus following abdominal surgery that involves a gastrointestinal anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

Although the prolonged duration of surgery (&gt;3 hours) increases the risk for postoperative ileus, there is not a strict correlation between the duration of the surgery and the duration of the ileus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/40,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42-44</a>].

Excess in perioperative fluid administration could result in edema formation within the gastrointestinal tract and may lead to postoperative ileus.

A meta-analysis that included 3861 patients from 23 randomized studies found an association between liberal fluid and increased time to first bowel movement (two days, 95% CI 1.3-2.3) as well as prolonged duration of hospital stay (four days, 95% CI 3.4-4.4) compared with restricted fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

On the whole, it appears that early enteral nutrition is not harmful and does not result in increased duration of postoperative ileus; rather, it reduces the length of postoperative ileus and hospital stay.
