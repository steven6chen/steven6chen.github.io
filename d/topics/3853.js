The etiology of the syndrome is unknown, and the pathophysiology is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Despite symptoms of soft tissue pain affecting the muscles, ligaments, and tendons there is no evidence of tissue inflammation.</p><p>FM, like other functional somatic syndromes, has been a controversial condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Patients look well, there are no obvious abnormalities on physical examination other than tenderness, and laboratory and radiologic studies are normal. Thus, the role of organic illness had been questioned, and FM was often been considered to be psychogenic or psychosomatic. However, ongoing research suggests that FM is a disorder of pain regulation, often classified as a form of central sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-fibromyalgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>FM is often associated with other conditions that may cause musculoskeletal pain, disruption of sleep, or psychiatric symptoms; features of these conditions may also mimic FM, and the presence of such disorders should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of FM will be reviewed here. The differential diagnosis of FM is discussed in detail separately, as are the possible pathogenic mechanisms and treatment of FM in adults, and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of FM in children and adolescents.

FM is more common in women than men and occurs in both children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. It is six times more common in women in reports from specialty clinics, although the female predominance is not as striking in the community and when using survey criteria that do not require a tender point examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis may be underrecognized in clinical practice; prevalence estimates in one US county using surveys with standardized criteria were higher than estimates based upon medical record documentation of the diagnosis (6.4 versus 1.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Prevalence studies in adolescents have been very similar to those in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A United Kingdom population study found a prevalence of chronic widespread pain of 14 percent and FM of 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a National Health Service electronic health records survey in the United Kingdom, there was an increase in the diagnosis of FM for the period 2001 to 2013 compared with 10 years earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Initially termed fibrositis, FM was described in France and England in the mid-19th century. By the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, many rheumatologists recognized FM as a discrete syndrome, and diagnostic classification criteria were proposed, evaluated, and then validated. Using such criteria, FM has been recognized worldwide; as examples, reports found a prevalence of 1.6 percent in France, 2.5 percent in Brazil, and 3.6 percent in Bangladesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>At least 10 percent of the general population has chronic widespread pain, and the majority of these individuals do not have any specific disease or structural abnormality to account for the pain; many of these patients have symptoms and findings compatible with FM. More than 40 percent of patients referred to a tertiary pain clinic meet the diagnostic criteria for FM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue, often accompanied by other somatic symptoms, as well as cognitive and psychiatric disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/1,2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,15</a>]. Physical examination reveals tenderness in multiple soft tissue anatomic locations. Laboratory testing is normal in the absence of other illnesses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60339\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60339 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Some disorders are seen in greater frequency in patients with FM than in the general population. Certain of these conditions may cluster with FM and have some common pathophysiologic features, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and migraine. Additionally, certain features of other commonly associated disorders may simulate or exacerbate the symptoms of FM, such as musculoskeletal pain in patients with chronic forms of arthritis; and sleep disturbance and fatigue in patients with depression, obstructive sleep apnea, or restless legs syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Coexisting disorders'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characteristic complaints include chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain; numbness, tingling, and other abnormal sensations; fatigue and poor sleep; cognitive and psychiatric symptoms; headache; and a variety of other symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Widespread musculoskeletal pain</strong> &ndash; The cardinal manifestation of FM is widespread musculoskeletal pain involving both sides of the body and present above and below the waist. However, the pain may initially be localized, often in the neck and shoulders. Common patient descriptions include &quot;I feel as if I hurt all over,&quot; or &quot;it feels as if I always have the flu.&quot; Patients typically describe pain predominantly throughout the muscles, but often state that their joints hurt, and sometimes describe joint swelling, although synovitis is not present on examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/1,2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fatigue</strong> &ndash; The other universal symptom of FM is fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This is especially notable when arising from sleep, but is also marked in the mid-afternoon. Seemingly minor activities aggravate the pain and fatigue, although prolonged inactivity also heightens symptoms. Patients are stiff in the morning and feel unrefreshed, even if they have slept 8 to 10 hours. Patients with FM characteristically sleep &quot;lightly,&quot; waking frequently during the early morning and have difficulty getting back to sleep. A common quote is &quot;No matter how much sleep I get, it feels like a truck ran me over in the morning.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive disturbances</strong> &ndash; Cognitive disturbances are present in the majority of patients. The cognitive disturbances are often referred to as &quot;fibro fog.&quot; Patients typically describe problems with attention and difficulty doing tasks that require rapid thought changes. Neuropsychological testing reveals abnormalities that are somewhat different than those found in psychiatric disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychiatric symptoms</strong> &ndash; Depression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anxiety are present in 30 to 50 percent of patients at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>]. In a Canadian general population sample of 127,000, those 1635 subjects with FM were three times more likely to have depression compared with subjects without FM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Twenty-two percent of the FM group had concurrent major depression. Depression in that group correlated with younger age, female gender, unmarried status, food insecurity, number of chronic conditions, and limitations in activities. Two-fifths of those with depression and FM had not discussed mental health concerns with any health professionals in the previous year (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Coexisting disorders'</a> below). Mood disorders are also associated with severity of FM symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Headache</strong> &ndash; Headaches are present in more than 50 percent and include migraine and muscular (tension) types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In an ambulatory tertiary headache clinic, FM was present in 174 of 889 patients (20 percent), including 44 percent of those with chronic, tension-type headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. FM comorbidity correlated with frequency of headaches, anxiety, pericranial tenderness, poor sleep, and physical disability. FM is especially common in patients with episodic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paresthesias</strong> &ndash; Patients also often report paresthesias, including numbness, tingling, burning, or creeping or crawling sensations, especially in both arms and both legs. However, unless a concurrent neurologic disorder, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or a cervical radiculopathy, is present, a detailed neurologic evaluation or formal testing is usually unremarkable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other symptoms and disorders</strong> &ndash; Patients also may have a variety of poorly understood pain symptoms, including abdominal and chest wall pain, such as symptoms of costochondritis; symptoms suggestive of IBS; and pelvic pain and bladder symptoms of frequency and urgency suggestive of the interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/painful</span> bladder syndrome (formerly female urethral syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although IBS is the most common gastrointestinal syndrome associated with FM, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is also more common in FM than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other common complaints include ocular dryness, multiple chemical sensitivity and &quot;allergic&quot; symptoms, palpitations, dyspnea, vulvodynia, dysmenorrhea, sexual dysfunction, weight fluctuations, night sweats, dysphagia, dysgeusia, palpitations and orthostatic intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/17,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,28,29</a>]. Dry eye syndrome is 1.4-fold higher in FM compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The Raynaud phenomenon (RP) is common in FM, although the thermographic and microvascular abnormalities seen in primary RP are not present in RP reported in FM patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Hearing loss was four- to fivefold more often reported in patients with FM than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some individuals commonly report that particular weather conditions or changes in the weather may aggravate symptoms, but consistent effects of such conditions upon daily pain or fatigue have not been found in most studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. As an example, a detailed study of the influence of weather on symptoms of pain and fatigue involving 403 women with FM found a statistically significant but small effect of weather upon either pain or fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with FM, the one finding that is usually present on physical examination is tenderness in soft-tissue anatomic locations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77950 \">figure 1</a>). However, the extent and severity of these findings may vary over time and from day to day. The tender point examination requires that the examiner knows where to palpate and how much pressure to apply:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amount of pressure appropriate for detecting these tender points should equal 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/cm&sup2;,</span> which is enough to whiten the nail bed of the examiner's fingertip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nine pairs of tender points used for the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Classification Criteria (see <a href=\"#H198274422\" class=\"local\">'1990 ACR classification criteria'</a> below) are at locations that most primary care clinicians and specialists routinely evaluate in patients with soft tissue complaints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77950 \">figure 1</a>). These locations include the upper mid-trapezius muscle, the lateral epicondyle (the so-called tennis elbow location), the second costochondral junction (the site of costochondritis), the greater trochanter (the site of trochanteric bursitis of the hip), and other sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FM patients are typically not as tender in the so-called control locations, such as over the thumb, the mid-forearm, and the forehead, when these control areas are palpated in a similar fashion to the defined FM tender points. Similarly, the joint examination may reveal some tenderness over the joints and joint lines themselves.</p><p/><p>The neurologic evaluation sometimes reveals minor sensory and motor abnormalities, in the absence of another condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92110677\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing and other studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FM does not cause any abnormalities in routine clinical laboratory testing or imaging. However, abnormalities have been identified in research studies using specialized neuroimaging (eg, functional magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and other techniques that reveal distinctions between patients with FM and control subjects. Research studies have also found that a subset of patients with FM have abnormalities on skin biopsies suggestive of small fiber neuropathic changes; the meaning of these findings is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-fibromyalgia#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia&quot;, section on 'Altered pain processing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-fibromyalgia#H12284305\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia&quot;, section on 'Peripheral pain mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with symptoms of chronic widespread pain should be suspected of fibromyalgia (FM) and undergo evaluation to confirm or exclude the diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H104197752\" class=\"local\">'Clinical diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H104197758\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below). Typical patient complaints that should raise suspicion of FM are &ldquo;I hurt all over&rdquo; or &ldquo;It feels like I always have the flu&rdquo; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F63893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63893 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104197752\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of FM is based primarily upon the patient's symptoms of widespread pain, typically reported in the muscles and joints, and findings of multiple tender points in characteristic soft tissue locations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77950 \">figure 1</a>), in the absence of evidence on physical examination and laboratory testing of joint or muscle inflammation that would explain the patient&rsquo;s symptoms. A specific number of tender points is not required to make the diagnosis in clinical practice. (See <a href=\"#H104197758\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H198274422\" class=\"local\">'1990 ACR classification criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>Other common features supporting the diagnosis include fatigue and nonrestorative sleep, cognitive disturbances, and the coexistence of other disorders often seen in association with FM, including depression, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), bladder irritability, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Coexisting disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>FM, like headache or IBS, will continue to be a controversial diagnosis because of a lack of clinically apparent objective changes, and there has been controversy regarding the utility of the diagnosis of FM. Although some have argued that providing a diagnostic label to everyday symptoms increases illness behavior, there are now more studies suggesting that patients improve after a diagnosis and there is significant saving of health care dollars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104197758\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination, together with limited laboratory testing to exclude other conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F63893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63893 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56396\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56396 \">algorithm 1</a>). The diagnostic evaluation is usually straightforward and should never be a &quot;fishing&quot; expedition to exclude every potential cause of pain and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History &ndash; A thorough medical history should be obtained. Particular attention should focus on:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptoms of FM, including chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain lasting at least three months (often for many years); a history of tenderness to touch; fatigue; sleep, cognitive (eg, problems with attention and clarity of thought), and psychiatric disturbances; paresthesias; problems with balance; and sensitivity to noises, light, odors, and cold (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A history of conditions that may be associated with FM, including depressive disorders; anxiety disorders; posttraumatic stress disorder; chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID); obstructive sleep apnea; restless legs syndrome; other factors that may disrupt sleep; chronic or recurrent headaches (including migraine); bladder irritability; Raynaud phenomenon (RP); symptoms of autonomic dysfunction (eg, orthostatic tachycardia); and other pain and functional somatic syndromes such as vulvodynia and temporomandibular syndrome (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Coexisting disorders'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A history of other conditions that may cause musculoskeletal pain and coexist with or mimic FM, including inflammatory rheumatologic disorders (eg, rheumatoid arthritis [RA], systemic lupus erythematosus, spondyloarthritis), noninflammatory rheumatic diseases (eg, osteoarthritis), localized pain syndromes, and thyroid disease (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Coexisting disorders'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination &ndash; A thorough physical examination should be performed, with particular attention to a careful joint and neurologic examination, both to identify findings typical of FM (eg, tender points in characteristic locations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77950 \">figure 1</a>)) and to exclude other illness presenting with similar symptoms, as well as to detect findings suggestive of other similar or related conditions that may cause musculoskeletal pain and fatigue (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Coexisting disorders'</a> below).

A joint examination should always be done, looking for any synovitis and also palpating for tenderness over the joints themselves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing &ndash; There is no diagnostic laboratory test or radiographic or pathologic finding, and testing should be kept to a minimum. Often, subspecialty referral is more cost-effective than ordering multiple laboratory and imaging studies if another condition or type of disorder is suspected. Testing is done primarily to exclude an associated disease or another illness that may mimic FM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F63893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63893 \">table 2</a>), because FM itself does not cause any abnormalities in laboratory testing or imaging. We use the following approach to laboratory testing:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We obtain a complete blood count (CBC) and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or a C-reactive protein (CRP) for initial laboratory evaluation. Since FM is not an inflammatory condition, normal acute phase reactants immediately provide confidence that an occult inflammatory disorder is unlikely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serologic tests, such as antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor, should be obtained only if the history and physical examination suggest an inflammatory, systemic rheumatic disease.

They are less useful for diagnosing FM in routine clinical practice.</p><p>The ACR criteria were based upon expert rheumatologists' opinions regarding the optimal historical and physical findings that could differentiate patients with FM from those with other rheumatic diseases and forms of chronic pain. These criteria were then field-tested in a number of academic rheumatology clinics and office practices.</p><p>The final 1990 ACR FM classification criteria included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of widespread pain, occurring both above and below the waist and affecting both the right and left sides of the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical findings of at least 11 of 18 defined tender points (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77950 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p/><p>These simple criteria had greater than 85 percent sensitivity and specificity for differentiating patients with FM from those with other rheumatic diseases.</p><p>In office practice, the diagnosis of FM can be made even if fewer than 11 of 18 tender points are present, provided that the history is consistent with FM and that the major differential diagnoses have been excluded (see <a href=\"#H104197752\" class=\"local\">'Clinical diagnosis'</a> above). The tender points represent heightened pain perception rather than sites of inflammation or tissue pathology. Thus, they are proxies for detecting widespread pain, and the exact number necessary to diagnose FM clinically is somewhat arbitrary. It is important to recognize that the classification criteria were validated for large patient populations and should be used primarily in clinical research and epidemiologic studies of FM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H198274414\"><span class=\"h3\">2010 ACR preliminary diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some investigators have advocated not using the tender point examination as part of the FM diagnostic criteria and relying only upon symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]; in practice, tender point counts are often not obtained, and most clinicians have not been trained in the tender point examination, which has raised concerns about the accuracy of the diagnosis by nonspecialists. The 2010 ACR preliminary diagnostic criteria (2010 criteria) for FM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81631\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81631 \">table 3</a>) provide an alternative approach to diagnosis and classification, which does not require a tender point examination, but does provide a scale for measurement of the severity of symptoms that are characteristic of FM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These criteria also recognize the importance of cognitive problems and somatic symptoms in patients with FM that were not considered in the 1990 ACR classification criteria.</p><p>The 2010 criteria may be used in patients with symptoms present at a similar level for at least three months, and no other disorder that would otherwise explain the pain. They combine a widespread pain index (WPI) and a symptom severity (SS) scale for making the diagnosis of FM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81631\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81631 \">table 3</a>). The WPI is a measure of the number of painful body regions from a defined list of 19 areas. The SS score includes an estimate of the degree of fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms, and the number of somatic symptoms in general. The SS can also be used for the assessment of patients with current or previous FM or for longitudinal evaluation.</p><p>The 2010 criteria showed good correlation with the 1990 ACR criteria (see <a href=\"#H198274422\" class=\"local\">'1990 ACR classification criteria'</a> above), and since they can be self-administered, these new criteria will be more practical for population-based studies of chronic widespread pain. These and similar criteria may be particularly useful for clinicians who are inexperienced in performing tender point examinations, as additional data points in difficult cases, and may be useful in the primary care setting to determine the need for rheumatology referral for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, these questionnaire-based criteria alone cannot be used for establishing the diagnosis of FM, and they require additional validation in different patient populations (eg, primary care settings and patients with other rheumatic diseases).</p><p>A modification of the 2010 criteria, the 2011 modification of the 2010 ACR preliminary criteria (2011 modified criteria), was then developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

In one study, these 2011 modified criteria had sensitivity and specificity for FM of 90.2 and 89.5 percent, respectively, among patients referred to a rheumatologist, typically for widespread pain, from a primary care practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Further modification of the scoring increased the sensitivity and specificity to 93.1 and 91.7 percent, respectively. Applying the 1990, the 2010, or the 2011 modified FM criteria changed the prevalence of FM as much as fourfold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The prevalence of FM was 1.7 with the 1990 criteria and 1.2 with the 2010 criteria, but 5.4 with the 2011 modified criteria. These modified criteria identified a greater proportion of men with FM and were more influenced by somatic symptoms than by pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In 2016, further modification of the 2010 criteria suggested using a generalized pain criterion, which decreased misclassification of regional pain syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In general, there has been good agreement between physician- and patient-based FM diagnostic criteria, especially for research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

The history and physical examination, as well as limited laboratory testing, are usually sufficient to differentiate FM from these other conditions, such as systemic inflammatory arthropathies, spondyloarthritis, systemic autoimmune (&ldquo;connective tissue&rdquo;) disorders, polymyalgia rheumatica, inflammatory myopathy, and hypothyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F50712\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50712 \">table 4</a>).

Some features of these conditions may simulate or exacerbate the symptoms of FM, such as musculoskeletal pain in patients with chronic forms of arthritis; and sleep disturbance and fatigue in patients with depression, obstructive sleep apnea, or restless legs syndrome. Recognition and effective treatment of these comorbidities can potentially contribute to symptomatic relief in patients with FM. These conditions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Functional somatic syndromes and related disorders</strong> &ndash; FM is often present in patients together with other common functional somatic syndromes, including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID); irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]; migraine; and temporomandibular disorder (TMD), as well as chronic bladder and pelvic pain syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/17,50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,50-53</a>].

Each of these conditions is diagnosed using criteria based upon the patients&rsquo; symptoms when other diseases have been excluded, and they tend to be controversial because of the absence of a specific diagnostic test or of objective pathophysiologic abnormalities.

In a large early arthritis cohort, the incidence of FM varied from 3.6 to 6.8 cases per 100 person-years. The incidence of FM was highest during the first year of arthritis and did not correlate with joint inflammation but did correlate with generalized pain and poor mental health. Patients with active inflammatory disease and coexistent FM may report greater symptom intensity than patients without FM, and it is important to distinguish symptoms of FM from those of chronic rheumatic diseases because of the different implications for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/64,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,66</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia&quot;</a>). RA disease activity scores, such as the disease activity score with a 28-joint count (DAS28), can be overestimated in patients with coexisting FM [52, 53].

Despite improved awareness among primary care clinicians, many continue to be uncomfortable with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. There are no objective physical, laboratory, or imaging abnormalities, and the diagnosis is based on subjective reporting of symptoms. FM patients rated receiving a diagnosis as somewhat difficult on average and had difficulties communicating their symptoms to the physician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Most patients rated their chronic widespread pain as moderate or severe, and FM symptoms were on average &quot;fairly&quot; to &quot;very&quot; disruptive and had a &quot;moderate&quot; to &quot;strong&quot; impact on patients' lives. However, patients waited on average almost a year after experiencing symptoms before presenting to a clinician, and before receiving a diagnosis of FM there was an average duration of 2.3 years and patients presenting to 3.7 different physicians. In one study of general practice patients, FM was commonly misdiagnosed as a psychiatric illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. In large population database studies, the FM diagnosis varied greatly based on demographic and social factors more than on symptom severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Recognition and diagnosis of FM leads to a decrease in resource use, including subsequent testing and overall healthcare costs, despite concerns that diagnostic labels such as FM would promote illness behavior and drive up healthcare costs. This was shown in a study involving more than 2000 patients, 81 percent women, who were newly diagnosed with FM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. During the 10 years before diagnosis, the patients with FM had considerably higher mean annual rates of visits, medication prescription, and testing, compared with controls (25 versus 12 visits and 11 versus 4.5 prescriptions). Following an FM diagnosis, visits for most symptoms and healthcare usage declined, although within two to three years visit levels rose. A decrease in costs as compared with the predicted trend has also been observed in the four years after diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Costs before diagnosis were used in a trend analysis to predict later costs, assuming the diagnosis had never been made, and these predicted costs were compared with the observed costs after diagnosis. The average difference between the predicted and observed cost in the primary care population in the United Kingdom that was studied was &pound;66.21 per six months per patient. Another report described both improved quality of life and decreased cost of health care after a diagnosis of FM, suggesting a need for early diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>Earlier detection of FM in primary care may be advanced with new diagnostic tools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. The FibroDetect includes 14 questions assessing patients' pain and fatigue, personal history and attitudes, symptoms, and impact on lives. The predictive accuracy of the tool increased to 0.86 for FM and non-FM patient detection, with a sensitivity of 90 percent and a specificity of 67 percent for a cutoff of 6 on the score.</p><p>Electronic medical records were used to identify variables associated with the diagnosis of FM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Significant differences between the FM and no-FM cohorts were observed for nearly all the demographic, clinical, and healthcare resource variables. These results support the use of electronic medical records data in clinical research for identifying variables associated with FM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

Physical examination reveals tenderness in multiple soft tissue anatomic locations. Laboratory testing is normal in the absence of other illnesses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60339\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60339 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We diagnose FM in patients who present with chronic myalgias and arthralgias but no evidence of joint or muscle inflammation on physical examination or laboratory testing that would explain the symptoms and findings. The physical examination should reveal multiple tender points at soft tissue locations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77950 \">figure 1</a>). In clinical practice, a specific number of tender points are not required to make the diagnosis, and FM may be diagnosed without a tender point evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H104197752\" class=\"local\">'Clinical diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing should be kept to a minimum, since there are no diagnostic laboratory tests for FM. We advise obtaining a complete blood count (CBC) and testing for an acute phase reactant, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), to exclude systemic inflammatory disease. Additional laboratory testing should be based upon clinical suspicion of a specific disorder, such as a thyroid-stimulating hormone test or a creatine kinase, if hypothyroidism or inflammatory myopathy are suspected, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H104197758\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional evaluation should be considered for associated conditions if clinically suspected, including sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome, and psychiatric disorders, such as depression or anxiety. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FM may coexist with other disorders, such as other functional somatic syndromes (eg, irritable bowel syndrome [IBS] and chronic headache), sleep and psychiatric disorders, inflammatory rheumatic disease syndromes, and noninflammatory musculoskeletal pain, including osteoarthritis. It is important to identify whether these conditions are present in patients with FM because of the treatment implications. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Coexisting disorders'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Goldenberg DL.
