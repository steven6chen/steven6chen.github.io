These tumors are likely derived from a post-germinal-center B cell that has commenced early stages of plasmacytic differentiation. ABC tumors frequently demonstrate trisomy 3, deletion of CDKN2A, which encodes <span class=\"nowrap\">INK4A/ARF,</span> and constitutive activation of the antiapoptotic nuclear factor kappa B pathway, and only rarely have (14;18) translocations. When compared with GCB tumors, ABC tumors are associated with inferior rates of five-year survival following standard R-CHOP.</p><p/><p>The GEP methods used evaluate the expression of 14 or 27 genes and use algorithms to produce a linear predictor score. The score has an assigned probability of identifying the case as ABC-type. If the probability of being ABC-type is &gt;90 percent or &lt;10 percent, cases are labeled ABC or GCB, respectively. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of cases do not meet these criteria and are identified as &quot;unclassifiable.&quot; The role that GEP plays in the diagnosis and treatment of DLBCL is being refined. It is clear that these two subgroups have different outcomes following standard R-CHOP. They also appear to have different outcomes following treatment with novel agents and may serve as biomarkers for treatment selection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma#H353922380\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Activated B cell type DLBCL'</a>.)</p><p>Additional profiling studies suggest that signatures of the surrounding stromal-cells also influence outcome, although this requires further study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H849415543\"><span class=\"h3\">Hans and Tally methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GEP is the gold standard for determining cell of origin, but current methods require fresh tissue and are not routinely available in practice. In an effort to avoid the need for GEP, panels of immunohistochemical markers have been proposed as an alternative means to identify the GCB and ABC subtypes of DLBCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. No single immunohistochemical marker can differentiate between GCB and ABC subtypes, and immunohistochemistry-based methods therefore rely on the differential expression of multiple protein markers in the GCB and ABC subtypes. The two most popular methods are the Hans algorithm and the Tally method (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F104767\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104767 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hans algorithm</strong> &ndash; The Hans classifier uses CD10, BCL6, and MUM1 in a stepwise progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Cases that express CD10 are classified as GCB. Those that do not express CD10 are evaluated for BCL6 and, if negative, are classified as non-GCB. For those that express BCL6, MUM1 is used as a &quot;tie-breaker.&quot; If positive, the cases are classified as non-GCB. If negative, they are classified as GCB. In the initial report, the Hans algorithm correctly assigned 112 of 142 tumors (79 percent concordance). Subsequent reports have estimated the sensitivity (85 to 90 percent), specificity (52 to 82 percent), positive predictive value (55 to 82 percent), and negative predictive value (83 to 90 percent) when compared with GEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tally method</strong> &ndash; The Tally method uses immunohistochemical markers to calculate a GCB score (CD10 and GCET1) and ABC score (MUM1 and FOXP1). Cases are classified as GCB or ABC if their GCB or ABC scores are greater, respectively. If the scores are equal, LMO2 is used as a &quot;tie-breaker.&quot; If LMO2 is &lt;30 percent, the case is classified as ABC. Otherwise, the case is GCB. An initial concordance of 93 percent was reported. Subsequent reports have estimated the sensitivity (80 to 99 percent), specificity (54 to 86 percent), positive predictive value (55 to 87 percent), and negative predictive value (79 to 99 percent) when compared with GEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p>Limitations of these methods include a reliance on markers that are not simply called &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative,&quot; but which require the use of staining cutoffs (eg, &gt;30 percent of cells positive). Because immunohistochemistry methods are not standardized across pathology departments, it may be difficult to use algorithms that rely upon staining cutoffs in routine clinical practice, particularly at referral centers where cases and tissue blocks from multiple hospitals are seen in consultation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H849415629\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymph2Cx platform</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative approach that is being explored is the use of new technologies that precisely quantify RNA transcript levels in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. These technologies, which essentially permit transcripts to be counted, appear to be less sensitive to variations in tissue fixation and processing than immunohistochemistry, and correlate well with results obtained by GEP on gene chips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The Lymph2Cx is one of these digital gene expression-based tests that are highly concordant with GEP. </p><p>An analysis of 344 patients with de novo DLBCL treated with R-CHOP reported the following estimated outcomes at five years according to molecular subtype as defined by Lymph2Cx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GCB-type DLBCL &ndash; Freedom from progression (FFP) 76 percent; progression-free survival (PFS) 73 percent; disease-specific survival (DSS) 82 percent; overall survival (OS) 78 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ABC-type DLBCL &ndash; FFP 51 percent; PFS 48 percent; DSS 61 percent; OS 56 percent </p><p/><p>These results suggest that the Lymph2Cx is able to distinguish two prognostically distinct groups of DLBCL.
