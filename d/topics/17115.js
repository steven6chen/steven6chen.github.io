(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma#H5112797\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for the development of melanoma&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Although patients with localized disease can be treated successfully with surgical resection in the majority of cases, some individuals present with or subsequently develop disseminated disease. The prognosis for patients with distant metastases from melanoma is poor, and the vast majority of those with stage IV melanoma will die from their disease.</p><p>An increasing understanding of melanocyte biology and melanoma pathogenesis is leading to the development of targeted therapies and the potential for major improvements in the care of patients with advanced melanoma. The most important breakthroughs have been the discovery that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is the key signaling pathway and the elucidation of the critical role of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF).</p><p>This topic provides an overview of melanocyte biology and the important molecular alterations of genes and signaling pathways that are critical to the<em> </em>development and pathogenesis of melanoma. The clinical results with targeted agents that are being developed based upon this information are discussed separately.

Melanocytes also make the pigment that determines skin and hair color.</p><p>Melanocytes are derived from pluripotent neural crest stem cells. Melanocyte development is modulated by KIT and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), factors that are mutated or amplified oncogenes in a fraction of melanomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) is a pro-pigmentation peptide that stimulates the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) on the surface of melanocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The <em>MC1R</em> gene exists in numerous variant (polymorphic) forms; nonsignaling variants produce the red <span class=\"nowrap\">hair/fair</span> skin phenotype, which is associated with an increased risk of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Intracellular cAMP induction downstream of MC1R activates the expression of MITF, which stimulates transcription of numerous genes that participate in the conversion of tyrosine into melanin pigments. Stimulation of cutaneous pigmentation following UV exposure (tanning) is thought to occur via keratinocyte DNA damage, p53-mediated induction of proopiomelanocortin <span class=\"nowrap\">(POMC)/MSH</span> expression, followed by secretion of MSH and stimulation of MC1R in epidermal melanocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Cutaneous UV exposure may induce behavioral effects, perhaps related to endorphin components of the <span class=\"nowrap\">POMC/MSH</span> complex, which may produce an addiction to sun bathing and, therefore, contribute to the increase in melanoma incidence observed over recent decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. &quot;Rescue&quot; of this cAMP-MITF-pigment cascade has been achieved via topical drug delivery in mouse models and confers protection against UV-induced carcinogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5643585\"><span class=\"h1\">MAPK PATHWAY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is activated in almost all melanomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53134 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In nonmalignant cells, the interaction between a growth factor receptor and its ligand is required to activate this pathway. This leads to a series of events that promote cellular growth and survival. The RAS family members are G-proteins, which serve as critical mediators in the transduction of such signals.</p><p>Results of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other large scale genomic analysis efforts in melanoma have identified hot spot mutations in <em>NRAS</em> in 25 to 30 percent of cutaneous melanomas, which are thought to be important drivers of oncogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A somatic mutation in the <em>NRAS</em> gene can cause constitutive activity of the NRAS protein, which is thus incapable of being &quot;turned off.&quot; This leads to the serial activation of <span class=\"nowrap\">serine/threonine</span> kinases, which promotes cell cycle progression, cellular transformation, and increased cell survival. In addition, this cascade of events may be mediated through the overexpression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperactivation of various growth factor receptors, such as c-Met, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and KIT, as well as through the loss of function of the <em>NF1</em> tumor suppressor gene that acts to suppress NRAS signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. In fact, the <em>NF1</em> mutation is now considered a third major genomic subset of cutaneous melanomas, behind <em>BRAF</em> and <em>NRAS</em> mutations, and is present in 13 to 14 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The most important downstream mediators of activated RAS are the <span class=\"nowrap\">serine/threonine</span> kinases BRAF and CRAF, which are activated following RAS binding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53134 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In contrast to BRAF, activation of the pathway by CRAF requires additional steps, whereas activation of BRAF alone is sufficient. This may explain why an activating mutation in the BRAF kinase domain is present in 40 to 50 percent of patients with melanoma, but there are no descriptions of activating mutations of CRAF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p>Following activation, RAF, typically in the form of either a homo- or heterodimer, interacts with the <span class=\"nowrap\">MAPK/extracellular</span> signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase MEK, thereby initiating MEK phosphorylation, which in turn leads to an activating phosphorylation of ERK, its only known substrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/17,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22,23</a>]. The activation of ERK leads to a pro-growth and transforming signal, through its interaction with a number of molecules, which appears to be critical to the pathogenesis of many malignancies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H220469\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular characterization of melanocytic lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>BRAF</em> mutations appear to be an acquired event that occurs in early invasive melanoma and leads to clonal expansion and tumor progression. The <em>BRAF</em> mutation, thus, is not a founder event but rather facilitates malignant transformation with the acquisition of subsequent oncogenic stimuli. Evidence supporting this interpretation includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>BRAF</em> mutations are common in melanocytic nevi, vertical growth phase melanomas, and metastatic melanoma (70 to 80, 40 to 50, and 40 to 50 percent, respectively).

Further elucidation of the mechanisms of transformation in <em>BRAF</em> mutant melanoma is needed.&nbsp;Irrespective of the mechanism, however, when these <em>BRAF</em> mutations occur in invasive melanoma, the resultant constitutive activation of MEK (and subsequently ERK) leads to oncogenesis through the promotion of cellular growth and opposition of apoptosis, as well as to the strict reliance of these cells upon the signaling cascade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H220084\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic abnormalities in melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genomic mutations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aberrations are present in the majority of melanomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/10-12,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12,30</a>]. These can lead to activation of the MAPK pathway and create an oncogenic addiction to the mutated or hyperactivated protein.

These mutations are either at the Q209 position of exon 5 or, less frequently, at the R183 position in exon 4.

Of potential importance, <em>GNAQ</em> mutations were proportionally more common in blue nevi and primary uveal melanomas, while <em>GNA11</em> mutations predominated in metastatic uveal melanoma deposits. Due to the reliance of ocular melanoma on <em>GNAQ</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>GNA11</em></span> mutations driving MAPK signaling, it is not surprising that, as a proof of concept, the MEK inhibitor selumetinib was shown to improve progression-free survival in patients with uveal melanoma in a randomized study compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

A key consequence of this homeostatic circuitry is that BRAF antagonists block MITF phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation, resulting in its stabilization and profound upregulation of certain (if not all) MITF transcriptional target genes.
