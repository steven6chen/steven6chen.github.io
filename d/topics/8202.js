Applying topical glucocorticoid drops to the infected eye (without use of concomitant antiviral medication) can exacerbate the infection and potentially lead to involvement of deeper stromal structures with threat to vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis and treatment of HSV corneal infections will be discussed here. Discussion of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of HSV-1-related infections in general, as well as other clinical manifestations of HSV-1 infection, is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Herpes simplex virology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two clinically important herpes simplex virus (HSV) types exist in the subfamily alpha herpesviridae, HSV-1 and HSV-2. Humans are the only natural host for both types. HSV-1 accounts for most oral, labial, and ocular infections and HSV-2 for most genital infections, although there is considerable and increasing overlap in these distributions.</p><p>Primary infection with HSV-1 occurs following inoculation of mucosal or skin surfaces by direct contact. Most ocular disease is thought to represent recurrent HSV disease following the establishment of viral latency in the host, rather than a primary ocular infection. Latency develops after the virus enters sensory neurons and travels to sensory ganglia (usually the trigeminal ganglion for ocular disease) by retrograde axoplasmic flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The virus remains in ganglia for the lifetime of the host. It has been proposed that HSV-1 latency may also be established in the cornea, although this is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During latency, the virus does not generally replicate and does not damage neurons. The latent viral genome assumes a circular form that is generally not transcribed. Intermittent shedding of trigeminal ganglion-based virus can be detected in tears and saliva of adult humans without apparent clinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Episodically, latency is interrupted, and infectious viral particles travel anterograde to neuronal endings where virus is shed. RNA molecules, known as latency associated transcripts (LAT), become detectable in infected ganglia and play a part in viral reactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Reactivation of HSV skin and mucosal infection has been attributed to psychological stress, physical trauma, fever, ultraviolet light exposure, and other viral infections. The role triggers play in ocular disease is less certain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Documented triggers for keratitis include ultraviolet laser treatment, topical ocular medications (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, beta-blockers, prostaglandins), and immunosuppression. The role of environmental ultraviolet light exposure in ocular disease has also been supported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Immunosuppressive drugs, especially ophthalmic topical glucocorticoids, are thought to allow normally asymptomatic periodic viral shedding to establish active infection, rather than by triggering reactivation from latency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of HSV corneal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of HSV corneal disease is complex and involves components of three processes: the active infection itself, inflammation caused by active infection, and immune reaction to past infection. Resulting structural changes in the cornea can lead to additional forms of keratitis.</p><p>The cornea is the clear thin anterior refracting tissue of the eye. The external, tear-covered, stratified epithelium overlies the collagenous, clear corneal stroma. The stroma comprises the bulk of the cornea and is about 500 microns thick. The single cell layer endothelium, in contact with the aqueous humor of the anterior chamber, maintains corneal clarity through fluid barrier and pump mechanisms.</p><p>Reactivated virus enters the basal epithelium of the cornea and multiplies within cells, spreading to adjacent cells. In primary infection, an inflammatory response triggers antigen-specific immune responses. IgG and IgA antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are involved in modulation of infection and latency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Corneal stromal cells, keratocytes, may support active infection with ensuing necrotizing inflammation. Retained viral antigens may lead to subsequent immune-mediated stromal inflammation without viral replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSV-1 infection, spread by direct contact with mucous membranes, is endemic in human populations. Most people have been exposed by middle age, with circulating antibodies to HSV-1 detectable in 90 percent or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Latent virus can be detected by PCR at autopsy in the trigeminal ganglion of most older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>].</p><p>Primary HSV-1 infection has an incubation period from one day to several days and is asymptomatic or not recognized more than 90 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most clinical ocular infections are manifestations of recurrent disease; ocular involvement occurs in less than 5 percent of primary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>The majority of ophthalmic herpes simplex virus (HSV) cases are unilateral, with recurrences affecting the same eye. Bilateral disease (not necessarily concurrent) occurs in 1 to 12 percent of cases and is more common in patients with atopy or other immune abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective study that compared 70 patients with HSV-associated eye disease with 280 controls, patients with HIV infection had an increased risk of developing ocular HSV (odds ratio 3.37, 95% CI 1.09-10.40) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The incidence of ocular disease is 6.8 to 31 per 100,000 annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. The prevalence in the US is about 150 per 100,000, with an estimated 20,000 new cases, and 48,000 episodes annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Recurrences after an initial ocular episode have been reported in 9.6 percent at one year, 22.9 percent at two years, 40.0 percent at five years, and 67.0 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/1,20,24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20,24,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) epithelial keratitis has an acute onset with variable symptoms of pain, visual blurring, and watery discharge.</p><p>The diagnosis of HSV keratitis is usually made on the basis of the clinical history and examination findings. The slit lamp findings in epithelial infection are often pathognomonic. Laboratory confirmation is rarely indicated.</p><p>Physical examination is notable for conjunctival injection near the limbus (ciliary flush), decreased corneal sensation, and characteristic dendritic lesions of the cornea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69708\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69708 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. When the corneal stroma is involved, symptoms may be similar, but typical findings are corneal edema or infiltrate.</p><p>Laboratory testing is usually not necessary to confirm a clinical diagnosis of HSV keratitis. Testing may be indicated in severe cases where the clinical findings are atypical but suspicion of HSV keratitis is high. However, even in such cases a clinical trial of antiviral therapy is usually initiated.</p><p>Serologic testing is not helpful because of the high prevalence of prior exposure in the population. When diagnostic testing is performed, ocular samples are taken by scrapings of epithelial lesions. Three types of tests are available: viral culture, detection of viral antigen, and detection of viral DNA.</p><p>Viral culture results in characteristic cytopathic effects, seen in one to several days. Enzyme immune assays (ELISA) to detect viral antigen are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] but have been largely superseded by an enzyme linked virus inducible system (ELVIS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viral DNA is more sensitive than antigen assays, but PCR will be positive even with inactive virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Rapid detection methods are in development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis, in the absence of obvious dendritic lesions, is that of the red eye. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-red-eye\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the red eye&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF OCULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ocular HSV-1 disease includes eyelid lesions (herpetic blepharitis), conjunctivitis, keratitis, retinitis, and rarely scleritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Corneal disease is the most prevalent form.</p><p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis has been classified in four categories: infectious epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endotheliitis, and neurotrophic keratopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Epithelial keratitis accounts for most first episodes of HSV keratitis, while stromal keratitis is unusual in initial disease but common in recurrent disease. The prognosis for visual loss is significantly worse with stromal than epithelial keratitis. Endothelial disease is uncommon but often leads to corneal edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">HSV epithelial keratitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epithelial keratitis is the most frequent form of ocular HSV infection. With appropriate treatment, healing occurs in two to three weeks, unless infection progresses to stromal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In one study, the duration of untreated epithelial keratitis averaged 17.6 days for an initial episode and 28.4 days for a recurrent episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Epithelial disease is manifested as dendritic lesions or geographic ulcerations of the cornea. These lesions can be observed after staining with dyes such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/27,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,37</a>]. Although dendritic lesions may be somewhat visible with a hand light without staining, slip lamp magnification and staining are usually necessary to define the details of the lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Dendritic keratitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic form of herpetic keratitis is the dendrite (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69708\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69708 \">picture 1</a>). Epithelial infection begins with granular punctate epithelial lesions that form vesicles, which then rapidly coalesce into a linear branching dendritic lesion.</p><p>Dendrites may be single or multiple and vary from &lt;1 mm to several millimeters long. Dendrites stain with topically-applied <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> dye in their bed and with Rose Bengal or lissamine green at their edges. Typically, the ends of the branches of the dendrite have bulbous thickenings.</p><p>Dendritic lesions are caused by actively proliferating virus within epithelial cells. The dendrite is initially elevated but, with lysis of the central epithelial cells, disrupts the corneal epithelial basement membrane and becomes a corneal ulcer. Rapidly healing lesions may not ulcerate. About one-fourth of dendritic lesions will heal rapidly and spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Geographic ulcer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Geographic ulcers, occurring in up to 22 percent of cases of epithelial HSV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], develop when a dendrite widens and assumes an amoeboid shape, often with dendritic extensions at the edges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Like dendrites, geographic ulcers represent destruction and desquamation of epithelial cells from active viral infection.</p><p>The use of topical glucocorticoids in patients with dendritic lesions has been thought to promote the development of geographic ulcers, but this concept has been disputed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Geographic ulcers respond more slowly to treatment and are more likely than dendrites to lead to scarring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Marginal keratitis (limbitis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Active epithelial HSV lesions that occur at the limbus (the junctional zone of the cornea and sclera) are termed marginal keratitis or limbitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Marginal lesions often are less dendritic in appearance than central corneal lesions, and thus may not be as easily diagnosed. The proximity to blood vessels at the limbus allows white cell infiltration and neovascularization of the underlying corneal stroma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">HSV stromal keratitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stromal involvement in HSV keratitis is rarely an initial ocular finding, accounting for less than 2 percent of initial presentations but for 20 to 60 percent of recurrent corneal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/20,35,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,35,39</a>]. Active stromal lesions do not usually occur at the same time as epithelial disease.</p><p>Stromal disease may result from active viral infection or immune and inflammatory reaction to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Immune stromal keratitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immune (non-necrotizing) keratitis occurs in 20 to 60 percent of eyes with recurrent HSV keratitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/1,20,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20,40,41</a>] and accounts for 90 percent of recurrent stromal keratitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The immune reaction is felt to represent a delayed hypersensitivity reaction by CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes reacting to viral antigens in the cornea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Several forms of this condition occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;ghost-like&quot; superficial stromal opacity beneath the site of a previous dendrite. These dendrite-shaped superficial lesions are clinically insignificant but may be helpful in making the diagnosis of past HSV infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized or diffuse inflammation of the stroma, usually without epithelial disease. The stromal inflammatory deposits are thought to represent complexes of viral antigen with antibodies and complement. These may take the form of a ring infiltrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &quot;disciform keratitis&quot; has been used to describe circular areas of stromal edema. Although previously considered a form of stromal keratitis, this is now recognized as edema of the stroma secondary to corneal endothelial inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Endotheliitis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stromal neovascularization may occur. Blood vessels may grow into the normally avascular corneal stroma, especially when the disease is long standing. These vessels may regress with treatment of the keratitis. Corneal stromal scarring almost always results and may decrease vision significantly depending on location and severity, making prompt treatment of active inflammation mandatory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stromal thinning, fibrosis and vascularization beneath the epithelium (pannus), and lipid deposits from stromal vessels are common as well.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Necrotizing stromal keratitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This form of HSV stromal disease, also known as interstitial keratitis, is the result of viral infection of the stroma and is less common than immune stromal keratitis. The typical finding is the presence of cellular infiltrates within the stroma at one or more sites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59223\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59223 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>These infiltrates may be true abscesses and are often associated with overlying stromal ulceration. Typically there are white cell deposits on the corneal endothelium, keratic precipitates, and an inflammatory reaction in the anterior chamber. Hypopyon or hyphema may result.</p><p>Corneal perforation may occur, particularly following glucocorticoid treatment without adequate concurrent antiviral treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62435\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62435 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The severe corneal destruction and occasionally rapid progression may make necrotizing HSV keratitis difficult to distinguish from bacterial or fungal infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Endotheliitis (disciform keratitis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corneal stromal edema in a circular pattern with underlying endothelial keratic precipitates occurs as a frequent form of recurrent HSV disease. Formerly known as disciform keratitis, this condition is now termed disciform endotheliitis. This is thought to be a manifestation of immune reaction rather than infection of the endothelial cells, although HSV has been isolated from the aqueous humor in rare cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. It is not temporally associated with either active epithelial infection or infiltrative stromal disease, and triggers for disciform endotheliitis are unknown. Endotheliitis is often associated with significant visual loss but is usually reversible with topical glucocorticoid therapy. Rarely a line of keratic precipitates moves slowly across the endothelium in a pattern known as linear endothelitis, which may be confused with cytomegalovirus keratitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurotrophic keratopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSV keratitis is variably associated with corneal hypesthesia or complete anesthesia from damage to corneal nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/36,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,45</a>]. Hypesthesia may lead to persistent non-healing corneal epithelial defects. These oval defects do not represent active viral disease and are made worse by antiviral drops. These non-healing lesions can lead to stromal scarring, corneal perforation, or secondary bacterial infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">HSV keratouveitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uveitis, inflammation of the vascularized intraocular tissues of the iris, ciliary body, and uveal tract, may occur with or without corneal involvement by HSV infection. Recurrent HSV should lead the differential diagnosis when iritis and keratitis occur together.</p><p>Isolated HSV iritis may be difficult to diagnose. One feature that distinguishes uveitis due to HSV is the tendency for involvement of the trabecular meshwork with resulting increase in intraocular pressure. Uveitis tends to recur and is often not diagnosed as herpetic unless typical corneal lesions appear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Postinfectious epithelial disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following resolution of active epithelial infection, the corneal epithelium may be unstable. Punctate epithelial staining with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> or lissamine green dye is common. Recurrent corneal erosions and intermittent sloughing of corneal epithelium without recurrent HSV infection may occur and may be provoked by use of topical ocular medications, such as antivirals and preserved glaucoma drops.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis is dependent upon whether the episode of disease is caused by active viral replication or immune response to past infection. The use of topical glucocorticoids when active HSV epithelial disease is present should be strongly discouraged, as they have long been observed to exacerbate epithelial lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Epithelial keratitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the availability of antiviral drugs, dendritic and geographic lesions were treated by debridement and chemical cauterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

As HSV is usually transmitted by mucosal contact, transmission of the virus would not be expected from ocular secretions alone. However, individuals with herpes keratitis may harbor HSV&nbsp;elsewhere (eg, oral secretions) and may transmit HSV from these sites. In addition, transmission from asymptomatic donors to corneal transplant recipients has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/herpes-simplex-keratitis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keratitis (corneal infection and inflammation) caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a major cause of blindness from corneal scarring and opacity worldwide. Most ocular disease is thought to represent recurrent HSV disease rather than a primary ocular infection. Corneal disease results from active infection, inflammation, and immune reaction to past infection. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HSV keratitis is largely clinical, with symptoms of pain, vision loss, and discharge. Physical examination is notable for chemosis, conjunctivitis, decreased corneal sensation, and characteristic dendritic lesions of the cornea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69708\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69708 \">picture 1</a>). Laboratory confirmation is rarely indicated, and serologic testing is not useful. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSV keratitis has been classified in four categories: infectious epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endotheliitis, and neurotrophic keratopathy. Epithelial disease is most common, manifested as dendritic lesions or geographic ulcerations of the cornea. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'HSV epithelial keratitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stromal keratitis accounts for 20 to 60 percent of recurrent corneal disease. Immune (non-necrotizing) keratitis usually presents as immune-mediated stromal inflammation without concurrent epithelial disease. Necrotizing stromal keratitis is due to active viral infection and may progress to corneal perforation. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'HSV stromal keratitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of HSV keratitis is dependent upon whether the episode of disease is caused by active viral replication or immune response to past infection. We recommend NOT using topical glucocorticoids when active HSV epithelial disease is present (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Medical treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that patients with epithelial HSV keratitis receive antiviral agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Oral and topical antivirals are equally effective, but oral agents are more convenient to use. Trifluorothymidine 1% (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=trifluridine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trifluridine</a>) is given one drop every two hours (eight or nine doses daily) for two weeks. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ganciclovir</a> 0.15% gel is given one drop five times daily until epithelial healing occurs and then three times daily for seven days. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> is given 400 mg five times daily. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Epithelial keratitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treatment of stromal keratitis with a combination of an oral antiviral agent and a topical glucocorticoid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Stromal keratitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with recurrent episodes of significant keratitis receive ongoing suppressive oral antiviral therapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Valacyclovir is given 500 mg once daily and acyclovir 400 mg two times a day. Suppressive therapy may not be cost-effective for patients with mild recurrent disease, and its effect does not persist when the drug is discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Suppression of recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have significant vision impairment due to corneal scarring from keratitis may require corneal transplantation. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> improves corneal graft survival.
