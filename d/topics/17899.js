The quality of the TURBT is of primary importance. An examination under anesthesia (EUA) should also be performed since the presence of induration or a palpable mass suggests muscle invasive disease. A single postoperative instillation of intravesical chemotherapy is recommended in appropriately selected patients.</p><p>Resection should also include biopsy of focal areas of suspected carcinoma in situ (CIS), and abnormal areas in the prostatic urethra and bladder neck. Most patients can be successfully managed conservatively; however, a minority will require more aggressive surgery. (See <a href=\"#H2155028809\" class=\"local\">'Cystectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>If the initial TURBT reveals muscle invasive disease, more aggressive treatment is indicated.

Approximately 30 percent of apparent T1 tumors will be found to have been understaged (ie, T2 or greater) by TURBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Thus, a repeat TURBT is strongly recommended in order to decrease the likelihood of understaging in patients whose tumors involve the lamina propria, even if the initial resection was thought to be complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>].</p><p>The importance of a restaging TUR is illustrated by a retrospective analysis of 1021 patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Viable tumor was found in 55 percent of patients at restaging TURBT. A follow-up of these patients by TUR at three months found that patients who had a restaging TURBT had significantly fewer recurrences compared with those with a single resection (9.6 versus 44.3 percent). Restaging TUR was associated with fewer recurrences (62 versus 77 percent) and significantly prolonged progression-free survival (82 versus 67 percent) at five-year follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1354236219\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluorescence endoscopy and narrow band imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both fluorescence endoscopy (blue light cystoscopy) and narrow band imaging (NBI) have been studied as ways to improve the detection of non-muscle invasive disease. However, neither has been shown to impact progression-free or overall survival.</p><p>Fluorescence endoscopy with blue light after intravesical instillation of a porphyrin, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hexaminolevulinate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hexaminolevulinate</a> (HAL) or 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), appears to be more effective than white light endoscopy for the detection of multifocal tumors and CIS, and they may improve outcomes of TURBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/13-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-20</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis that included 2906 patients from 14 randomized trials comparing HAL or ALA with white light cystoscopy in patients with known or suspected non-muscle invasive bladder cancer found that fluorescent cystoscopy resulted in a significant improvement in tumor detection and a decrease in subsequent recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, it is unclear whether this benefit persists for patients who receive immediate instillation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> following TURBT. A randomized trial that compared HAL photodynamic-assisted TURBT plus a single instillation of postoperative mitomycin with standard white light cystoscopy found no significant difference in recurrence rates at three months and one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Fluorescence endoscopy with blue light is also feasible for surveillance flexible cystoscopy and is more effective at detecting recurrences. In a phase III trial, patients with a history of multiple, recurrent, or high-grade urothelial tumors were randomized after initial white light cystoscopy to proceed with immediate blue cystoscopy or to undergo only the white light cystoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Those with evidence of recurrence proceeded to TURBT within six weeks of cystoscopy. TURBT was performed with both white and blue light in all patients. Of the 103 patients who underwent TURBT, a recurrent tumor was confirmed in 63, including 13 cases (21 percent) in which malignancy was detected only by blue light flexible cystoscopy. At the time of TURBT, blue light detected tumors that were missed by white light in 29 cases (46 percent). False positive rates were the same for both cystoscopy methods (9.1 percent). Flexible fluorescent cystoscopy was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada in early 2018.</p><p>The improved early detection and treatment of tumors with fluorescence endoscopy needs to be balanced by a slightly higher false positive rate (mainly due to inflammation and scarring), the requirement for a special lens system, the need to instill the photosensitizer one hour prior to cystoscopy, as well as potentially higher costs.</p><p>NBI uses a specific wavelength of light to accentuate the visibility of blood vessels and enhance the visualization of tumors, thus potentially improving outcomes of TURBT. NBI has been used as an alternative approach in an effort to improve results from cystoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. However, in a large randomized trial, this approach failed to demonstrate a significant decrease in overall recurrence rates at 12 months compared with white light cystoscopy, except possibly in patients with low risk disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1529137460\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSTIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An estimated 40 to 80 percent of non-muscle invasive bladder cancers recur within 6 to 12 months when managed with a transurethral resection of all visible bladder tumor (TURBT) without additional therapy, and 10 to 25 percent will progress to muscle invasive, regional, or metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Thus, additional therapy is often indicated even though an initial complete TURBT is possible.</p><p>The most important prognostic factors are histologic stage and grade. Other factors that have been assessed include number of tumors, the frequency of recurrence, the tumor size, and the presence or absence of concomitant Tis disease (also called carcinoma in situ [CIS]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

These papillary tumors usually present as low-grade lesions that frequently recur multiple times prior to becoming invasive. The natural history of patients with Ta tumors without other evidence of invasive disease or Tis was illustrated by a retrospective series of 363 patients, in which only 6 percent eventually died of bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The fraction of patients who eventually progress to a high-grade lesion and require more aggressive treatment ranges from 6 to 28 percent in different series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H174694891\"><span class=\"h3\">Tis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tis (also called CIS) is characterized by severe cellular dysplasia in the absence of discrete tumor formation. Areas of mucosal involvement with Tis are often found in association with invasive disease. The presence of Tis in the mucosa adjacent to a Ta or T1 tumor appears to increase the risk for muscle invasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>].</p><p>The potential prognostic significance associated with Tis is illustrated by a multicenter series of 243 patients who underwent radical cystectomy for Tis without more invasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Staging based upon the cystectomy specimen revealed that no disease (T0) was found in 8 percent, and Tis and Ta were identified in 48, and 8 percent of cases, respectively. However, T1, T2, T3, and T4 disease was detected in 13, 12, 5, and 6 percent of cases, respectively. Lymphovascular invasion and positive lymph nodes were found in 9 and 6 percent, respectively.</p><p>Tis is associated with a high incidence of subsequent progression to invasive disease. In a retrospective single-institution series of 155 patients managed with transurethral resection and BCG, the five-year cumulative incidence of progression to clinical T1 or higher stage disease was 45 percent (95% CI 37-55) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Diffuse and extensive involvement of the mucosa with Tis is associated with particularly aggressive disease. Invasive bladder cancer develops in 60 to 80 percent of such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2557193432\"><span class=\"h3\">T1 lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T1 tumors are by definition invasive cancers and are characterized by extension into the underlying lamina propria (also known as the submucosa) but without involvement of the muscularis propria, the true detrusor muscle of the bladder. </p><p>Virtually all T1 tumors are high grade, and approximately one-third to one-half have associated Tis. Recurrence rates at one, three, and five years can reach up to 50, 70 to 80, and 90 percent, respectively, and 20 to 25 percent progress to more invasive (T2 or greater) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Conflicting data exist on whether nonprimary T1 lesions (occurring in patients who had a prior tumor resection for Tis or Ta disease) have a higher frequency of progression after BCG treatment compared with those with an initial presentation with T1 disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. </p><p>Because of the risk of progression, T1 tumors are generally treated with intravesical BCG, which reduces the rates of recurrence and progression by 30 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/32,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,48</a>].

The WHO system employs the terms papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP), low-grade urothelial carcinoma, and high-grade urothelial carcinoma. This has become the standard methodology for grading non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, although some community practices still report using the older grade 1 to 3 classification. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of bladder neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The importance of histologic grade was illustrated in a systematic review conducted by the European Association of Urology (EAU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In an analysis of 20 series that included all 2809 patients with evaluable data, the risk of progression to more advanced disease for patients with PUNLMP, low-grade urothelial carcinoma, and high-grade urothelial carcinoma was 1.7, 4.4, and 18.8 percent, respectively, while the risk of recurrence in the 1865 evaluable patients was 28, 43, and 58 percent, respectively.</p><p>In this systematic review, the risk of progression and recurrence was also analyzed based upon the 1973 criteria for grade 1, 2 and 3 lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, the risk of progression to more advanced disease for the 2012 patients with data was 3, 9, and 28 percent, respectively, for grade 1, 2, and 3 lesions, and the risk of recurrence for the 1197 patients with data was 33, 44, and 65 percent, respectively.</p><p>Patients with grade 1 or 2 papillary (Ta) lesions who remain free of recurrence for at least five years usually have a good prognosis.
