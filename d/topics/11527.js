Cleavage of the prohormone proBNP produces biologically active 32 amino acid BNP as well as biologically inert 76 amino acid N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP).</p><p>Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a hormone that is released from myocardial cells in the atria and in some cases the ventricles in response to volume expansion and possibly increased wall stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. ANP circulates primarily as a 28 amino acid polypeptide, consisting of amino acids 99-126 from the C-terminal end of its prohormone, pro-ANP. </p><p>The release of both ANP and BNP is increased in heart failure (HF), as ventricular cells are recruited to secrete both ANP and BNP in response to the high ventricular filling pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The plasma concentrations of both hormones are increased in patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, permitting their use in diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55557\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55557 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The diagnostic and prognostic value of measuring plasma BNP, N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) and mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) in patients with heart failure will be presented here. </p><p>Natriuretic levels in non-heart failure settings are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natriuretic peptide measurement in non-heart failure settings&quot;</a>.) The possible therapeutic role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> (recombinant human BNP) in the management of patients with decompensated HF is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-in-the-treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nesiritide in the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure&quot;</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC ROLE IN HF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both ANP and BNP have diuretic, natriuretic, and hypotensive effects. They also inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, endothelin secretion, and systemic and renal sympathetic activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64943\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64943 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among patients with HF, increased secretion of ANP and BNP may partially counteract the effects of norepinephrine, endothelin, and angiotensin II, limiting the degree of vasoconstriction and sodium retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In one study of patients with moderately severe HF, for example, administration of an orally active inhibitor of the endopeptidase that degrades ANP led to reductions in plasma aldosterone concentrations and right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) filling pressures, as well as a decrease in body weight presumed to be due to diuresis, natriuresis, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These effects were presumably mediated by enhanced natriuretic peptide activity.</p><p>An unexpected finding is that BNP may protect against collagen accumulation and the pathologic remodeling that contributes to progressive HF. Studies in BNP knockout mice reveal increased cardiac fibrosis in response to ventricular pressure overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

These include a rapid point-of-care assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>] as well as central lab assays that offer improved precision compared to the point-of-care test. These assays are harmonized at a value of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> but above or below this level the correlations are not strong. &#160;</p><p>Plasma BNP concentrations have been variously reported in units of <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L,</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span>. The currently available rapid assay reports results in <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL;</span> the assay range is 5 to 1300 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] or 1.4 to 376 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Genetic factors may account for roughly 40 percent of the total variation in plasma BNP in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similar variability has been noted with N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'N-terminal pro-BNP'</a> below.)</p><p>A potential source of error is that plasma BNP concentrations can vary with the assay used (due to various antibody configurations), age, sex, and body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The normal values tend to increase with age and to be higher in women than men. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma N-terminal pro-BNP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal subjects, the plasma concentrations of BNP and NT-proBNP are similar (approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span>. However, in patients with LV dysfunction, plasma NT-proBNP rises more than BNP. Scaling varies among BNP assays while NT-proBNP assays are standardized, so there is no simple conversion factor to compare BNP and NT-proBNP levels. As discussed below, an NT-proBNP level &gt;900 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> provides roughly equivalent accuracy as a BNP level of &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> for diagnosis of heart failure. </p><p>Plasma concentrations of NT-proBNP are higher in older individuals and in women than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. On the other hand, plasma BNP and NT-proBNP are lower in obese individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], indicating that optimal reference intervals should account for age, gender, and perhaps body mass index (or other measure of body composition). In addition, NT-proBNP increases with renal failure and optimal cut-off values for diagnosis in such patients have not been clearly established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H22200902\" class=\"local\">'Renal failure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Assay purity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available commercial assays for plasma BNP or NT-proBNP actually measure mixtures of peptides. Plasma BNP assays appear to detect various degradation products of BNP as well as proBNP. Assays for NT-proBNP likely also detect proBNP. The relative contribution of individual natriuretic peptides has not yet been elucidated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Variability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variability in peptide measurements must be considered when interpreting serial BNP or NT-proBNP results. Intraindividual biologic variation as well as analytic assay variation contribute to total variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Manual and point-of-care assays have greater analytic variation than central laboratory analyzers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Total variability determines the percentage change (the relative change value or RCV) needed to demonstrate a significant difference in results over time. In a review of studies of BNP and NT-proBNP variability, a mean 25 percent decrease in BNP was required for a significant within day change and a mean 72 percent decline in BNP was required for a significant week to week change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Variability for NT-proBNP testing was less, so RCVs were lower: an 11 percent decrease was required for a significant within day change and a 47 percent decrease was required for a significant week to week change. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22201902\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of other conditions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22200902\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations are elevated in patients with renal failure. In patients with chronic kidney disease, decreased estimated GFR is associated with increased plasma BNP and even greater elevation in NT-proBNP concentrations.</p><p>Plasma BNP concentrations are often elevated in patients with renal insufficiency, whether or not they have clinically diagnosed HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. BNP is cleared by the receptor-mediated binding and removal, neutral endopeptidase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], as well as by passive excretion so GFR is inversely related to BNP concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23</a>]. As a result, the cut-off values for plasma BNP in patients with renal insufficiency are different from those in patients with normal renal function. Elevations in BNP levels in renal failure may also result from volume expansion or from left ventricular hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and monitoring plasma BNP does not appear to facilitate the management of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>We do not use plasma BNP for the diagnosis or management of HF in patients with renal failure, with or without dialysis. The main value would be a low plasma BNP, which would exclude left ventricular dysfunction.</p><p>Measuring plasma NT-proBNP has an added problem since NT-proBNP is cleared by the kidney and its plasma concentration is elevated by renal failure alone. There are insufficient data to establish clear cut-off values for NT-proBNP in this setting. In a review of 599 patients with a serum creatinine &le;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> who presented to the Emergency Department with a complaint of dyspnea, cut-off values for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> were &gt;450 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> in those less than 50 years of age and &gt;900 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> in older patients; the cutoff was 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> for patients with a GFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Using these values, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing HF were 85 and 88 percent for those with a GFR &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and 89 and 72 percent in those with a GFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27939917\"><span class=\"h3\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obese patients tend to have lower plasma BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations than nonobese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/15,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24-27</a>]. There are conflicting data as to whether the lower values in obese patients reflect a direct association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] or are a function of other variables including age, sex, and HF severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Despite the lower values with obesity, higher plasma BNP values within any body mass index category is associated with worse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22201975\"><span class=\"h3\">Other conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Natriuretic peptide levels are elevated in some patients with non-heart failure conditions such as coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, and sepsis. The diagnostic and prognostic value of measuring plasma BNP and N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) in asymptomatic individuals and patients with non-heart failure conditions is discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F99857\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99857 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natriuretic peptide measurement in non-heart failure settings&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PLASMA BNP IN HEART FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The circulating concentration of BNP is less than 20 percent of that of ANP in normal subjects, but can equal or exceed that of ANP in patients with HF; this wider range of concentrations makes measurement of BNP more useful than ANP in evaluation of patients with HF. For this reason, the clinical experience with plasma BNP is much greater than with plasma ANP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The plasma half-life of BNP is estimated to be about 20 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, as noted above, assays for BNP likely measure a mixture of BNP and proBNP. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">BNP and the diagnosis of HF in the patient with dyspnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Establishing HF as a cause of dyspnea in patients presenting to the emergency department is extremely important, but symptoms and physical findings may not be sufficiently sensitive to make an accurate diagnosis. The assay for plasma BNP is a useful test in the evaluation of patients with dyspnea, and is especially useful as a component of the evaluation of suspected HF when the diagnosis is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/31-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;, section on 'BNP and NT-proBNP'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Breathing Not Properly study</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The value of rapid bedside measurement of plasma BNP for distinguishing between HF and a pulmonary cause of dyspnea was best evaluated in the Breathing Not Properly (BNP) study of 1586 patients presenting to the emergency department or urgent care setting with a major complaint of acute dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The final diagnosis was HF in 47 percent (confirmed by chest radiograph <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> echocardiography and other clinical tests by two independent cardiologists), no HF in 49 percent, and noncardiac dyspnea in patients with a past history of LV dysfunction in 5 percent. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma BNP was markedly higher in patients with clinically diagnosed HF (including patients with right heart failure due to cor pulmonale) compared to those without HF (mean 675 versus 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span>.

The predictive accuracy of plasma BNP for HF was equivalent to or better than other parameters such as cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, a history of HF, or rales on physical examination, and was better than the widely used NHANES and Framingham criteria for the diagnosis of HF (83 versus 67 and 73 percent, respectively).

Plasma BNP should NOT be measured during the administration of nesiritide, since nesiritide will be detected as an acute increase in plasma BNP concentration (eg, from 700 to 13,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>].

The prohormone of atrial natriuretic peptide (proANP) is a polypeptide of 126 amino acids. The N-terminal portion of proANP, termed proANP1&ndash;98 or NT-proANP, has a much longer half-life than mature ANP and has therefore been proposed as a more reliable analyte for measurement than ANP. An investigational commercial assay detects mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP). </p><p>The multicenter BACH (Biomarkers in Acute Congestive Heart Failure) trial evaluated the utility of monitoring MR-proANP as compared to BNP in 1641 patients presenting to the emergency department with shortness of breath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

Natriuretic peptides and other vasoactive peptides were measured in 1237 patients with chronic stable HF at randomization and at three months. The addition of MR-proANP improved classification for mortality when added to models based on clinical risk factors alone (net reclassification improvement [NRI] = 0.12) or together with NT-proBNP (NRI =0.06).
