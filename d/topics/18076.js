Doctors call this condition &quot;TR&quot; for short.</p><p>When the heart valves work normally, they keep blood flowing in only 1 direction. The valves work like swinging doors that open only 1 way &ndash; letting blood out, but not back in. The tricuspid valve normally keeps blood flowing from the right atrium to the right ventricle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58389 \">figure 1</a>). When it leaks, it lets blood flow back into the right atrium. Normally, little or no blood is able to leak backward. But if the valves are not working properly, more blood can go back in the direction it came from.</p><p>Many healthy people have a small amount of TR. But some people have larger amounts of TR, which can lead to problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2363568280\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of tricuspid regurgitation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with TR have no symptoms. They might find out they have it when their doctor or nurse hears a heart murmur on a routine exam. A heart murmur is an extra sound in the heartbeat that doctors or nurses hear when they listen to the heart with a stethoscope.</p><p>When TR causes symptoms, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the belly, legs, or ankles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;pulsing&quot; feeling in the blood vessels in the neck</p><p/><p>If the TR is caused by another condition, people can have other symptoms. For example, TR can happen from a condition called &quot;pulmonary hypertension.&quot; Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs. Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include feeling very weak or tired, or having trouble breathing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2363568295\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for tricuspid regurgitation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms, do an exam, and order one or more tests. The test done most often to check for TR is an echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;). This test uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart as it beats. It shows the size of the heart chambers, how well the heart is pumping, and how well the heart valves are working (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Your doctor might also order:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray &ndash; This can show the size and shape of your heart, as well as changes in your lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2363568350\"><span class=\"h1\">How is tricuspid regurgitation treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your symptoms, how severe they are, and what's causing your TR. If your TR is mild or you have no symptoms, you might not need any treatment or follow-up. But even if you have larger amounts of TR, you might not need treatment. It's possible that your doctor will simply want to keep an eye on you to see if a need for treatment develops.</p><p>If your TR is severe and causes symptoms, you will need treatment. This can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines or procedures to treat the cause of your TR, if it can be treated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;diuretics,&quot; which help reduce swelling by making people urinate a lot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; If medicines don't help enough, you might need surgery to fix or replace your tricuspid valve.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2363568365\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-murmurs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart murmurs (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=swelling-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Swelling (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-hypertension-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pulmonary hypertension (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-valves-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prosthetic valves (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=edema-swelling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Edema (swelling) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
