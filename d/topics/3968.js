It commonly involves the rectum and may extend in a proximal and continuous fashion to involve other parts of the colon.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history of ulcerative colitis. The definition, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of ulcerative colitis are discussed in detail, separately.

Bowel movements are frequent and small in volume as a result of rectal inflammation. Associated symptoms include colicky abdominal pain, urgency, tenesmus, and incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with mainly distal disease may have constipation accompanied by frequent discharge of blood and mucus.</p><p>The onset of symptoms is usually gradual, and symptoms are progressive over several weeks. Symptoms may be preceded by a self-limited episode of rectal bleeding that occurred weeks or months earlier.</p><p>The severity of symptoms may range from mild disease with four or fewer stools per day with or without blood to severe disease with more than 10 stools per day with severe cramps and continuous bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H596557654\" class=\"local\">'Disease severity'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients may have systemic symptoms including fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Patients may also have dyspnea and palpitations due to anemia secondary to iron deficiency from blood loss, anemia of chronic disease, or autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The presence and severity of systemic symptoms depends on the clinical severity of the intestinal disease.

Patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis may have abdominal tenderness to palpation, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and pallor. Rectal examination may reveal evidence of blood. Patients with prolonged diarrhea symptoms may have evidence of muscle wasting, loss of subcutaneous fat, and peripheral edema due to weight loss and malnutrition.

The severity of disease activity can be objectively measured using a clinical disease activity index. The Montreal classification of severity of ulcerative colitis is one such index that stratifies ulcerative colitis severity into mild, moderate, and severe based on the frequency and severity of diarrhea, and the presence of systemic symptoms and laboratory abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild</strong> &ndash; Patients with mild clinical disease have four or fewer stools per day with or without blood, no signs of systemic toxicity, and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Mild crampy pain, tenesmus, and periods of constipation are also common, but severe abdominal pain, profuse bleeding, fever, and weight loss are not part of the spectrum of mild disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate</strong> &ndash; Patients with moderate clinical disease have frequent loose, bloody stools (&gt;4 per day), mild anemia not requiring blood transfusions, and abdominal pain that is not severe. Patients have minimal signs of systemic toxicity, including a low-grade fever. Adequate nutrition is usually maintained, and weight loss is not associated with moderate clinical disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe</strong> &ndash; Patients with a severe clinical presentation typically have frequent loose, bloody stools (&ge;6 per day) with severe cramps and evidence of systemic toxicity as demonstrated by a fever (temperature &ge;37.5&deg;C), tachycardia (HR &ge;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute),</span> anemia (hemoglobin &lt;10.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> or an elevated ESR (&ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour)</span>. Patients may have rapid weight loss.</p><p/><p>Most patients with ulcerative colitis present with an attack of mild severity at presentation, approximately 27 percent of patients have moderate disease, and 1 percent have severe disease at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The Mayo scoring system can also be used to assess disease severity and monitor patients during therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-mayo-score-for-assessing-ulcerative-colitis-activity\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Patients with fulminant colitis are at high risk of developing toxic megacolon as the inflammatory process extends beyond the mucosa to involve the muscle layers of the colon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Toxic megacolon is characterized by colonic diameter &ge;6 cm or cecal diameter &gt;9 cm and the presence of systemic toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

However, it may also occur in the absence of toxic megacolon in patients with the first episode of ulcerative colitis due to lack of scarring from prior attacks of colitis. Perforation with peritonitis has been associated with 50 percent mortality in patients with ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

It commonly involves the rectum and may extend in a proximal and continuous fashion to involve other parts of the colon. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ulcerative colitis usually present with diarrhea, which is frequently associated with blood. Associated symptoms include colicky abdominal pain, urgency, and tenesmus. Patients may also have fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Ulcerative colitis primarily involves the intestine but may be associated with several extraintestinal manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Colitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1844647817\" class=\"local\">'Extraintestinal manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcerative colitis should be suspected in patients with chronic diarrhea for more than four weeks. The clinical presentation, including laboratory features, endoscopic appearance, and radiology findings, is not specific for ulcerative colitis, and may be seen in a number of other causes of colitis including Crohn disease, radiation colitis, ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, and colitis related to medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67648 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1492761672\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is based on the presence of chronic diarrhea for more than four weeks and evidence of chronic colitis on endoscopy and biopsy. Since these features are not specific for ulcerative colitis, establishing the diagnosis also requires the exclusion of other causes of colitis by history, laboratory studies, and by biopsies of the colon obtained on endoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H25426526\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ulcerative colitis usually present with attacks of bloody diarrhea that lasts for weeks to months. The course of ulcerative colitis typically consists of intermittent exacerbations alternating with periods of complete symptomatic remission. However, a small percentage of patients have continuing symptoms and are unable to achieve remission. Overall, patients who present initially with proctitis have a more benign disease course and frequently respond to topical therapy, whereas those who present with more extensive disease require systemic therapy and have a higher risk of colectomy. (See <a href=\"#H596557654\" class=\"local\">'Disease severity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1575040140\" class=\"local\">'Factors affecting disease course'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-severe-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of severe ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extension of colonic disease is seen in up to 20 percent of patients within five years. Approximately 67 percent of patients have at least one relapse 10 years following the diagnosis. The risk of relapse depends on the age at initial diagnosis. The likelihood and timing of colectomy depends on the extent of the disease and severity at presentation. Mucosal healing in response to treatment is an important predictor of long-term clinical outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H1575040140\" class=\"local\">'Factors affecting disease course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications associated with ulcerative colitis include severe bleeding, toxic megacolon, perforation, strictures, and the development of dysplasia and colorectal cancer. Patients with ulcerative colitis may have a slightly higher mortality as compared with the general population. (See <a href=\"#H2266085790\" class=\"local\">'Chronic complications'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Silverberg MS, Satsangi J, Ahmad T, et al.
