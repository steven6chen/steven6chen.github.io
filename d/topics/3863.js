However, hemophilia must sometimes be differentiated from other bleeding disorders when the family history is negative or unknown. Differentiation between hemophilia and other conditions, such as some types of von Willebrand disease or acquired factor inhibitors, and distinction between hemophilia A and B are crucial for appropriate management.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia A and B will be reviewed here, along with a discussion of obstetrical issues.

Individuals may also be classified as having mild hemophilia despite having a factor level of &ge;40 percent if they share a genetic variant in the relevant factor with a family member who has hemophilia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91040405\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemophilia A is more common than hemophilia B. Hemophilia A is also more likely to be severe. Typically reported incidences are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemophilia A</strong> &ndash; Hemophilia A occurs in approximately 1 in 5000 live male births. Approximately two-thirds have severe disease (ie, factor VIII activity &lt;1 percent of normal).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemophilia B</strong> &ndash; Hemophilia B occurs in approximately 1 in 30,000 live male births. Approximately half have severe disease (ie, factor IX activity &lt;1 percent of normal).</p><p/><p>Severe hemophilia is almost exclusively a disease of males, although females can be affected in some rare cases (eg, compound heterozygosity; skewed lyonization; X chromosome loss). In contrast, mild hemophilia has been reported in up to one-quarter of female carriers who are heterozygotes. (See <a href=\"#H91042678\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding in females/carriers'</a> below.)</p><p>Hemophilia occurs in all ethnic groups and throughout the world. A publication from the World Hemophilia Foundation estimated that 43 percent of the world's hemophilia population lives in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and China, of which only 12 percent have been diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of hemophilia relate to bleeding from impaired hemostasis, sequelae from bleeding, or complications of coagulation factor infusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27041152\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with more severe hemophilia are more likely to have spontaneous bleeding, severe bleeding, and an earlier age of first bleeding episode, which can begin as early as birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H91040191\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>Delayed bleeding after trauma is common; it can be massive or may persist as continuous oozing for days or weeks. In contrast, bleeding from small cuts is uncommon. The overall frequency of bleeding has declined with greater use of prophylactic factor administration, such that some patients with severe disease may not experience a severe bleeding event.</p><p>Rarely, patients with severe hemophilia have a milder-than-expected clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The following examples illustrate potential mechanisms for the attenuation of disease severity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemophilia B Leyden</strong> &ndash; The hemophilia B Leyden phenotype is characterized by severe hemophilia in childhood that becomes mild after puberty. Mutations in these individuals occur in the factor IX promotor, affecting expression of the gene, rather than the factor IX coding region. The increase in factor IX expression after puberty is likely due to hormonal changes and testosterone sensitivity.

These prothrombotic conditions may potentially ameliorate the hemostatic defect of hemophilia, resulting in fewer bleeding episodes and a later onset of first bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].

Bleeding is less frequent than in severe hemophilia and typically occurs four to six times yearly. However, more frequent bleeding may occur if a target joint develops. Some patients with moderate hemophilia may express a more severe phenotype requiring the use of prophylactic treatment regimens.</p><p>In contrast, individuals with mild hemophilia generally only have bleeding in response to <span class=\"nowrap\">injury/trauma</span> or surgery, and bleeding may not become clinically apparent until later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Delayed bleeding can occur after minor surgical procedures such as tooth extraction, even in patients with mild disease. (See <a href=\"#H86820608\" class=\"local\">'Age at first bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p>Female carriers have variable factor levels. Those with a factor activity level near or above 50 percent of normal are not expected to have a clinical bleeding disorder, and carrier status is primarily important for the potential reproductive implications (ie, risk to male children). Other female carriers may have factor activity levels less than 50 percent of normal, and may have greater bleeding than unaffected relatives or matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In a 2016 cohort of 547 babies with hemophilia, the annual prevalence of ICH was approximately 4 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In this cohort, 46 episodes of ICH occurred in the first two years of life, and of these, 18 (39 percent) were spontaneous, 14 (30 percent) were associated with delivery, and 11 (24 percent) were traumatic; the remainder were of unknown cause. In a multicenter review of 27episodes of ICH, 11 (41 percent) occurred within the first week of life, most associated with trauma.

These inhibitory antibodies develop in response to exogenous factor; they occur in approximately 30 percent of patients with severe hemophilia A and 3 to 5 percent with severe hemophilia B. Inhibitors are much less common in patients with mild or moderate disease, presumably because the infused factor is not as likely to be recognized as a foreign protein in these individuals.

Patients with mild hemophilia may have a normal aPTT because the aPTT can be normal with factor levels above 15 percent, depending on the sensitivity of the aPTT assay used. Thus, while a prolonged aPTT is consistent with hemophilia, a normal aPTT does not exclude the possibility of mild hemophilia, especially hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency). Thus, specific factor analysis is performed regardless of the aPTT result.</p><p>If the aPTT is prolonged, mixing studies are done to determine whether the patient has a factor deficiency or an inhibitor.

Normal ranges for activity are determined from reference plasma. The normal range is generally considered to be from approximately 55 percent to 150 percent of the normal value; this range may also depend on the laboratory performing the testing and the age of the patient. A factor activity level of 100 percent corresponds to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span>. Chromogenic assays, in which the readout is based on release of a colored product, are increasingly being used; these assays have less variability and measure the activity of the specific factor rather than the entire coagulation cascade.</p><p>Some assays are performed as automated, one-stage assays that compare coagulation time of patient plasma to reference plasmas (normal and factor-deficient), using serial dilution to determine the factor activity level. Less commonly, a two-stage aPTT-based assay is used. In the first stage, patient plasma is depleted of some factors (II, VII, IX, and X), and then factors are added that allow coagulation to progress to the formation of factor Xa but not further (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90873\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90873 \">figure 2</a>). In the second stage, normal plasma is added to allow coagulation to progress to clot formation. The coagulation time can be measured by release of a chromogenic end product or by optical density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Two-stage methods are more difficult to perform but are less subject to other variables (eg, variation in the levels of other coagulation factors, presence of a lupus anticoagulant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. Two-stage and chromogenic assays are more sensitive for identifying mild hemophilia. Highly specific assays using immunoradiometric methods and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent techniques (ELISA) also have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Two-stage and chromogenic assays are especially useful for patients with borderline values. Several reports have described hemophilia mutations for which a two-stage assay demonstrated lower factor activity than a one-stage assay; a hemophilia diagnosis would have been missed if only the one-stage method had been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/71,72,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72,74,75</a>].</p><p>Importantly, some forms of von Willebrand disease (VWD; type 2N or 3) have decreased factor VIII activity levels, because von Willebrand factor (VWF) stabilizes circulating factor VIII. All patients with reduced factor VIII activity levels should have testing for VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) to eliminate the possibility of type 3 VWD.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis#H1194654088\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemophilia A and B: Routine management including prophylaxis&quot;, section on 'Prophylaxis versus on-demand therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p>These recommendations are largely consistent with guidelines from the National Hemophilia Foundation Medical and Scientific Advisory Council (MASAC) in the United States and the United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors' Organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179529876\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At birth, diagnosis can be made using cord blood or a venous blood sample. Cord blood testing is preferred if possible to avoid the risk of bleeding with venipuncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Cord blood is tested for factor activity level of the appropriate factor. Values must be compared with age-appropriate normal ranges because healthy newborns have lower levels of factor IX than older children. Results of cord blood testing may not be accurate in newborns with mild hemophilia, and it may be prudent in later infancy to retest those who appear to be unaffected when tested as a newborn.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91041047\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of hemophilia includes other inherited bleeding disorders and other causes of a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Usually these conditions can be readily differentiated by measurement of the appropriate factor level.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>von Willebrand disease</strong> &ndash; Like hemophilia, von Willebrand disease (VWD) is an inherited bleeding disorder that may be associated with a normal or prolonged aPTT; some patients with VWD will also have reductions in factor VIII levels. Unlike hemophilia, VWD transmission is autosomal (autosomal dominant for types 1 and 2; autosomal recessive for type 3). Thus, VWD is equally common in male and female patients, and disease severity is similar in both sexes. Most types of VWD present with a different bleeding pattern from hemophilia (eg, mucosal bleeding seen in VWD; joint bleeding seen in hemophilia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 2</a>). However, some types of VWD (eg, type 2N, type 3) have bleeding patterns similar to hemophilia. Details of diagnostic testing to differentiate VWD from hemophilia are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease&quot;, section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inherited platelet disorders</strong> &ndash; A variety of inherited platelet disorders can cause clinical bleeding symptoms. Like hemophilia, some of these may be associated with normal platelet counts. Unlike hemophilia, inherited platelet disorders should have normal coagulation testing, and most of these disorders are autosomal rather than X-linked. Inherited platelet disorders may be characterized by thrombocytopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormal platelet morphology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89962 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and acquired disorders of platelet function&quot;, section on 'Inherited disorders of platelet function'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-thrombocytopenia-in-children#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of thrombocytopenia in children&quot;, section on 'Genetic causes of defective thrombopoiesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Factor XI deficiency</strong> &ndash; Factor XI deficiency (also called Rosenthal syndrome; hemophilia C) is an inherited bleeding disorder. Like hemophilia A and B, factor XI deficiency is characterized by a prolonged aPTT. Unlike hemophilia A and B, patients with factor XI deficiency tend to exhibit provoked bleeding (eg, bleeding in response to trauma) rather than spontaneous bleeding. Factor XI deficiency is more prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews (Jews from Eastern Europe). Diagnostic testing for factor XI deficiency will reveal low factor XI levels and normal factor VIII and factor IX levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-xi-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factor XI deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Factor XIII deficiency</strong> &ndash; Factor XIII is involved in stabilizing the fibrin clot and protecting it from fibrinolysis. Factor XIII deficiency is an inherited bleeding disorder that can produce severe bleeding in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes, and milder bleeding in heterozygotes. Like hemophilia, factor XIII deficiency can present with intracranial hemorrhage around the time of birth or bleeding associated with umbilical cord separation. Unlike hemophilia, the typical presentation is delayed bleeding after initial hemostasis; impaired wound healing and pregnancy loss may also be seen. Unlike hemophilia, factor XIII deficiency is characterized by a normal aPTT and PT, and normal activity levels of factor VIII, IX, and XI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders#H4349864\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rare inherited coagulation disorders&quot;, section on 'Factor XIII deficiency (F13D)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other factor deficiencies with prolonged aPTT</strong> &ndash; Other inherited conditions such as deficiencies of factor XII, prekallikrein, or high molecular weight kininogen can cause a prolonged aPTT. Unlike hemophilia, these deficiencies are not associated with clinical bleeding. Diagnostic testing will reveal the specific deficiency, with normal factor VIII, IX, and XI levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rare inherited coagulation disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Very rarely, a patient may have combined factor VIII and factor V deficiency due to a defect in a gene affecting cellular transport, rather than a defect in a coagulation factor gene. Unlike hemophilia, however, these patients will have a prolonged PT as well as aPTT. Finding of prolonged PT and aPTT should prompt additional testing such as mixing studies for the PT test and specific factor assays if coagulation testing shows correction with mixing studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rare inherited coagulation disorders&quot;, section on 'Factor V and VIII combined deficiency (F5F8D)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acquired factor inhibitors</strong> &ndash; Acquired inhibitors are autoantibodies that can interfere with the normal activity of coagulation factors. Inhibitors to factor VIII, XIII, and other factors have been reported; these can develop during pregnancy or in patients with an underlying systemic disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, malignancy, or a drug reaction. Acquired inhibitors during pregnancy can cross the placenta and impair hemostasis in the fetus or neonate. Like hemophilia, acquired inhibitors may present with bleeding and a prolonged aPTT. Unlike hemophilia, acquired inhibitors most commonly present in adulthood, and mixing studies fail to show correction of the aPTT when patient plasma is mixed with control plasma, because the inhibitory antibody is present in excess. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired inhibitors of coagulation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests#H956524025\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;, section on 'Use of mixing studies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is due to an acquired autoantibody that prolongs the aPTT in vitro, but clinically manifests as a prothrombotic state rather than impaired hemostasis (ie, patients with APS may have thromboembolism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent pregnancy loss). Rarely, APS may be associated with prolongation of the PT and acquired prothrombin deficiency. Unlike hemophilia, the prolonged aPTT in APS does not show correction when patient plasma is mixed with control plasma; additional laboratory findings of APS are presented separately.

Severity depends largely on the factor activity level, with severe disease defined as &lt;1 percent of normal; moderate disease as 1 to 5 percent, and mild disease as &gt;5 percent. (See <a href=\"#H91040191\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hemophilia A and B&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe hemophilia experience spontaneous bleeding and bleeding in response to minor trauma that is out of proportion to the degree of injury, which can begin as early as birth. Delayed bleeding after trauma is common; it can be massive or may persist as continuous oozing for days or weeks. In contrast, mild hemophilia may only become apparent when there is a significant hemostatic challenge such as trauma or surgery. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Initial presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most infants with severe hemophilia present within the first year to one and a half years of life with easy bruising, hemarthrosis, bleeding due to oral injury, or after an invasive procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Life-threatening bleeding can occur at delivery, with trauma, or spontaneously. Approximately 3 to 5 percent of infants with severe hemophilia develop subgaleal or intracerebral hemorrhage in the perinatal period. (See <a href=\"#H86820608\" class=\"local\">'Age at first bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Once children begin walking, joint and other musculoskeletal bleeding, frenulum and oral injuries, and forehead hematomas become more common. (See <a href=\"#H86820528\" class=\"local\">'Initial site of bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common sites of bleeding include intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), joints and soft tissues, and oral mucosa. ICH is relatively rare compared with other sites, but it is one of the most dangerous and life-threatening events. Hemarthrosis (ie, hemorrhage into a joint) is the most common site for bleeding in ambulatory patients. (See <a href=\"#H3084248\" class=\"local\">'Sites of bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late complications from bleeding include neurologic sequelae of intracranial hemorrhage, and joint destruction from repetitive hemarthroses (ie, hemophilic arthropathy). Complications of factor infusion include the potential for infection, which has declined dramatically since the mid-1980s and is extremely low, and development of inhibitory antibodies to the infused factor. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Late complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female carriers are heterozygous for the genetic defect (ie, they have one normal allele and one abnormal allele) and are expected to have approximately 50 percent of normal factor production, which is generally sufficient to prevent clinical bleeding. However, some hemophilia carriers have symptoms similar to males with mild hemophilia. Potential hemophilia carriers should be tested using genetic testing. If carrier status is confirmed, measurement of factor levels is appropriate to guide management during hemostatic challenges. (See <a href=\"#H91042678\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding in females/carriers'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Carrier detection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic evaluation begins with a thorough review of the patient's personal bleeding history and family history; however, approximately one-third of patients with hemophilia have a negative family history, typically due to a de novo mutation. Laboratory testing includes screening tests of hemostasis, factor activity levels, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic testing (also called molecular testing). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic criteria for hemophilia include confirmation of a factor activity level below 40 percent of normal (below 0.40 international units <span class=\"nowrap\">[IU]/mL),</span> or a hemophilia gene mutation. A normal von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) should also be documented in patients with reduced factor VIII activity levels, to eliminate of the possibility of von Willebrand disease (VWD). (See <a href=\"#H179529698\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carrier females who become pregnant should undergo evaluation of fetal sex using a non-invasive method, such as ultrasound, because only male children are potentially affected. Maternal factor levels should be determined prior to invasive procedures including neuraxial anesthesia. The maternal and fetal risks of vaginal versus Cesarean delivery should be discussed. Generally, confirmatory testing to diagnose or exclude hemophilia in a male child is performed at birth, on cord blood. Circumcision should be deferred until the diagnosis is confirmed or excluded. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Carrier detection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H151067\" class=\"local\">'Obstetrical issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of hemophilia includes other inherited bleeding disorders (eg, VWD, platelet disorders, other factor deficiencies) and acquired coagulation factor inhibitors.
