A member of the OPO, or a provider trained in the consent of families for organ donation, should approach the family as soon as reasonable after the determination of brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The OPO staff will also coordinate evaluation of the donor for suitability for transplant and will communicate with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to match the donor with an appropriate recipient from the waiting list.

There is no official consensus to change this terminology, however. </p><p>DCDD has become an accepted method of increasing the donor pool in some transplant centers and organ procurement organizations (OPO), although the exact definition of circulatory death and the timing of organ procurement remain controversial. Nonheartbeating donors can be classified according to the Maastricht system, which was developed in 1995 and revised in 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I Dead on arrival to hospital</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>II Unsuccessful resuscitation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>III Awaiting cardiac arrest (inpatient withdrawal of support)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV Cardiac arrest after brain-stem death</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>V Cardiac arrest in a hospital inpatient</p><p/><p>Since the first successful transplantation of lungs from a nonheartbeating donor in 2001, ethical and legal frameworks have been put in place to investigate and utilize increasing numbers of allografts from nonheartbeating donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Up to 20 to 30 percent of all lung transplants come from DCDD in Australian and European centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However DCDD accounts for only a small percentage of deceased organ donors in the United States with the majority of lung transplant programs having never performed such transplantation. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) annual data report, from 2011 to 2016, the use of lungs from DCDD donors increased from 1 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Situations in which DCDD may be considered include irreversible brain injury, end stage musculoskeletal disease, and high spinal cord injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. These criteria may be used when the donor does not meet criteria for brain death (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Donation after brain death'</a> above). Other situations include sudden death without significant thoracic or abdominal trauma, known time of cardiac arrest, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers started within 15 minutes of cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The details of protocols and management recommendations for donation after cardiac death have been the subject of a consensus conference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By definition, death precedes organ procurement and requires cardiopulmonary criteria to prove absence of circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of death must meet criteria for irreversible cessation of function; procurement of organs should not cause death of the donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main criterion for cardiac death is absence of circulation, which may be assessed via an indwelling arterial line or Doppler study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiographic (ECG) silence is not a necessary criterion in the absence of circulation, but may be used as a confirmatory test; ECG silence alone is adequate evidence that circulation has ceased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The conference concluded that after cessation of circulation &quot;at least two minutes of observation is required, and more than five minutes is not recommended&quot; for declaration of death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Thoracic Society (ATS) states that ante mortem interventions such as obtaining blood samples, performance of bronchoscopy, injection of heparin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentolamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentolamine</a> and femoral cannulation are ethically appropriate if they contribute to good transplant outcomes and have a low chance of harming a prospective donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of withdrawal of life sustaining treatment, the time limit to cardiac death after treatment withdrawal may be up to two hours and still enable organ recovery. Several studies have developed criteria to help predict the likelihood of circulatory death within 60 to 120 minutes after planned withdrawal of life support, but more research is needed for a better understanding of the optimal timing of withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments and to reliably identify those who will die within two hours after withdrawal.</p><p/><p>The local OPO staff should become involved immediately after the decision is made to withdraw life sustaining treatment. The OPO staff will coordinate communication with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the transplant team, and the family and will coordinate evaluation of the donor's suitability for transplant.

No significant difference was found in perioperative mortality, airway dehiscence, dialysis requirement, postoperative length of stay, or overall survival.</p><p>Strategies to maintain the integrity of the allograft and reduce ischemic times from the moment of cardiac death to transplantation are key to the success of donation after cardiac death. A discussion of potential interventions to preserve lung function is presented separately.

Consensus and experience have identified some ideal and other less than ideal, or &quot;expanded,&quot; donor characteristics that are reviewed here.</p><p>Since the lung donor usually will be donating other organs, coordination between transplant teams is critical, so that all teams are ready to recover organs at nearly the same time. Further information regarding donor organ preservation is presented separately.

While the optimal degree of fit is unknown and the correlation between donor and recipient size need not be perfect, a close size match is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The underlying disease of the recipient may affect this, since the larger thoracic cavity of an emphysematous patient may be more amenable to a larger donor lung, and a smaller lung may fit well in the thoracic cavity of a patient with pulmonary fibrosis.</p><p>The use of oversized donor lungs (ie, slightly larger than predicted by recipient size) may reduce the risk of developing grade 3 primary graft dysfunction (PGD3) at any point within 72 hours of lung transplantation. Among 812 patients who underwent bilateral lung transplantation between 2002 and 2010, use of oversized donor lungs was associated with a lower odds ratio of PGD3 (adjusted OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.88), compared with using undersized lungs, but this effect was limited to recipients without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, given current donor organ shortage and waitlist mortality, it is not practical to intentionally oversize most allografts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-lung-graft-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary lung graft dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The effect of lung size mismatch on the risk of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) was examined in 159 adult bilateral lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Assessment of size matching was based on predicted values for gender and height. At one and six months, recipients with &quot;oversized&quot; lungs had higher expiratory airflow capacity based on higher ratios of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">)/forced</span> vital capacity (FVC), than those with &quot;undersized&quot; lungs. The probability of developing BOS, defined as a decrease of more than 20 percent from the highest post-transplant FEV<sub>1</sub>, was lower among those with oversized lungs. Further study is needed to determine the effects of lung size mismatch. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some cases, donors are ideal matches for recipients in many ways, except for size of the lung. In these cases, an alternative may be to perform a split lung bilateral lobar lung transplant or to downsize a large donor lung by lobectomy or wedge resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

These criteria include: age less than 55 years, clear chest radiograph, arterial oxygen <span class=\"nowrap\">tension/fraction</span> of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>)</span> &gt;300 mmHg at positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5, less than 20 pack year smoking history, absence of chest trauma, no evidence of aspiration or sepsis, no prior cardiopulmonary surgery, and absence of purulent secretions or gastric contents on bronchoscopic visualization prior to procuring the lungs.</p><p>Donors should be excluded if they are infected with HIV, human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus, or have active systemic viral infection (eg, measles, rabies, adenovirus, enterovirus, West Nile, and parvovirus), prion-related disease, or herpetic meningoencephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Certain other infections may also make organ donation less desirable. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Donor infection'</a> below.)</p><p>Any donor satisfying these ideal inclusion and exclusion criteria should be considered for lung donation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Expanded donor criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most potential organ donors do not meet the ideal lung donor criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74075\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74075 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], so many lung transplant programs use expanded criteria to increase the donor pool. When an extended criteria donor is being considered, effective communication between the organ procurement organization (OPO) coordinator and the transplant teams is essential. Each transplant team must know the original and current conditions of the donor. While outcomes for less-than-ideal criteria are acceptable, it is still the choice of the surgeon whether to accept a less-than-ideal donor lung. Some retrospective studies have examined outcomes for these expanded donor criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Advanced donor age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fifty-five years has been regarded as the upper age limit for an &quot;ideal&quot; candidate, based on the belief that accrual of comorbid conditions occurs as age increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In a retrospective study of lung transplant recipients from January 2005 to June 2014 from the UNOS thoracic database, lungs from donors aged &gt;60 years were utilized in 4 percent of recipients and were associated with a slightly worse five year (44 percent versus 52 percent, p&lt;0.001) overall survival, although not among recipients older than 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. No significant difference in survival was noted between recipients of lungs from young versus old donors when bilateral transplantation was performed. </p><p>Other studies have not shown a significant difference in outcomes when donors up to age 65 have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. A large retrospective analysis of 8860 lung allograft recipients from the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (UNOS) database in the post lung allocation score (LAS) era (2005 to 2012) revealed no significant increase in one year graft failure among donors aged 55 to 64 compared with donors aged 18 to 54 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>In a single center retrospective study, no significant survival differences were detected when donor lungs &ge;70 years were pre-selected for various criteria, including smoking status, oxygenation index, opacities on chest radiographs, and implanted in older recipients without pulmonary hypertension or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">ABO compatibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ABO-identical matches are preferred and may lead to a survival advantage over ABO-compatible matches.

Lung transplant in the setting of ABO incompatibility is not recommended.</p><p>In a retrospective database study, the outcomes of 342 single lung recipients from ABO-compatible donors were compared with those of 3230 single lung transplant recipients from ABO identical donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Lungs from ABO-compatible donors were not associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 1.02, 95% CI 0.8-1.22). The two groups did not differ significantly in median length of stay, incidence of post-transplant airway dehiscence, or number of acute rejection episodes. While this study is reassuring regarding the use of ABO-compatible donors when ABO-identical matches are not available, further study is needed to determine the optimal immunosuppression in this setting and to clarify long-term outcomes.</p><p>A potential concern related to use of ABO-compatible lungs is the passenger leukocyte syndrome, in which donor B lymphocytes carried in the lung allograft release antibodies that react with recipient red blood cells, causing acute hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

The groups did not differ in baseline age or arterial blood oxygen tension. In addition, recipients of lungs from donors who had smoked had longer stays in the hospital and intensive care units than did those who received lungs from nonsmokers. On the other hand, receiving transplanted lungs from a donor with a smoking history is associated with a lower unadjusted hazard of death than remaining on the waiting list without a transplant (0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.91). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective analysis of UNOS database from 2005 to 2011, use of lungs from heavy-smoking donors (HSDs; &gt;20 pack-years) was not associated with increased mortality for single lung transplants (n=498), if the donor was not actively smoking (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.59-1.19) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] and double lung transplants (n=766), irrespective of whether the heavy smoking was current or former for the double lung cohort (HR 1.003; 95% CI, 0.867-1.161) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Low-grade skin cancer (not melanoma) and carcinoma-in-situ (for example, of the cervix) have an exceedingly low potential for metastasis and thus should not be exclusionary factors. A history of melanoma is considered an absolute contraindication for organ donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors are unlikely to have spread past the blood-brain barrier. However, high-grade tumors, particularly glioblastomas or medulloblastomas, are at increased risk of metastasis and may represent contraindications to transplant. Craniotomy, ventricular shunts, and radiation to the tumor also increase the chance of tumor spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Donor infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission of infection from the donor to the lung transplant recipient is a significant risk for the recipient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76293 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/24,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,54</a>]. Certain donor infections do not limit transplant, provided the donor and recipient receive adequate treatment. In general, donor infection with gram positive organisms appears to affect outcomes less than gram negative infections. Invasive fungal disease is a contraindication.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bacterial and mycobacterial infections</strong> &ndash; Bacterial infections are the most problematic in the immediate postoperative period. Most centers administer empiric antibiotics to the recipient at the time of transplant and adjust these once results of intraoperative donor tracheal or bronchial aspirates are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Organs from bacteremic donors generally result in few if any transmitted infections when the donor has received pathogen-specific antibiotics for a minimum of 48 hours before procurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chest radiographs of potential donors should be screened for any evidence of active or prior <em>Mycobacterial tuberculosis </em>infection, which would exclude the patient as a transplant donor. Although transmission of <em>M tuberculosis</em> from donors has been reported in the absence of chest radiograph findings, more extensive testing for <em>M tuberculosis</em> is not feasible as it would delay organ procurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HIV, hepatitis C, hepatitis B</strong> &ndash; Transplant professionals and patients need to recognize that even comprehensive donor screening cannot detect all transmissible infections. Potential donors are screened for hepatitis C, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody positivity, and HIV. In addition to serologic testing, Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAT) is used for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV). The risk of HIV, HCV, or HBV transmission from a NAT negative donor organ is low (around 1 percent or less) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Highly active antiviral treatments for HCV have demonstrated high cure rates in transplant recipients and the non-immunosuppressed general population alike. In view of the high cure rates with new antiviral treatments, donors with hepatitis C ELISA positivity but NAT negative should no longer be excluded without discussion with the recipient. Even donors with true hepatitis C infection can be transplanted into a recipient who is hepatitis C positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although the data in lung transplant are limited, extrapolation of data from renal transplant recipients suggest that while infection with a different strain of hepatitis C may occur, this does not substantially affect outcomes among recipients with prior hepatitis C infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis C virus infection in kidney donors&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The risk of virus transmission in the setting of hepatitis B core (HBc) antibody positivity, but with absence of viremia or surface antigen negativity, is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Potential causes of anti-HBc positive, but nucleic acid test (NAT) negative, HBsAg negative, anti-HBs negative panel include (1) resolved infection, (2) false positive anti-HBc, (3) occult chronic infection, or (4) resolving acute infection. For susceptible lung recipients (anti-HBc-, anti-HBs-) of such donors, antiviral prophylaxis for up to one year may be considered, although data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who are seronegative for HIV, but meet high-risk behavioral criteria for HIV infection should not be excluded as organ donors, but the transplant team and potential recipient should be notified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytomegalovirus (CMV)</strong> &ndash; Routine prophylaxis against CMV infection has reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with this infection. While it is preferable to avoid transplanting lungs from CMV positive donors into CMV negative recipients, it is not always possible. CMV negative recipients who receive a lung allograft from a CMV-positive donor require close monitoring in addition to CMV prophylaxis.

Donors with human herpes viruses 6-8, simplex, and varicella may be used with caution.

Diagnostics remain challenging and are available primarily in central reference laboratories. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network <span class=\"nowrap\">(OPTN)/UNOS</span> Ad Hoc Disease Transmission Advisory Committee (DTAC), the American Society of Transplantation (AST), and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons (ASTS) have reviewed the potential risk of recent Zika virus infection on solid organ transplantation.

The deferral period may be adjusted as more is learned about length of time that Zika can persist in tissues or when a diagnostic test becomes available that can determine current or recent infection. It has been suggested that donor organs should not be used from individuals with symptoms suggestive of Zika virus infection and travel to an area of Zika transmission in the prior six months, unless symptoms can be attributed to another condition that does not preclude donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Ex vivo lung perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications such as pulmonary edema, contusions, and vascular thrombosis have typically rendered donor lungs unacceptable for transplantation, thereby reducing the supply of donor lungs. Efforts to improve the quality, and therefore the quantity, of lungs available for transplantation are ongoing. Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP, also known as ex vivo reconditioning) is being explored as a way to increase the number of acceptable lungs and is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Donor lung preservation&quot;, section on 'Normothermic ex vivo perfusion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H745459878\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gene expression microarray technology has been used to find molecular markers that predict primary graft dysfunction (PGD) in transplant recipients. In a case-control study, gene microarrays of 10 donor lungs that developed PGD were compared with 16 controls with a favorable outcome; four upregulated genes, ATP11B, FGFR2, EGLN1, and MCPH1, were associated with development of PGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Such biologic signatures may in the future supplement clinical criteria used at the preimplantation evaluation and selection stage to predict post-transplant complications, such as primary graft dysfunction, and help guide therapy in the immediate post-transplant period.</p><p>Gene therapy is also being investigated as a potential strategy to increase the number of donor lungs. Injured human lungs that were considered to be unsuitable for clinical use were treated with adenoviral mediated human interleukin (IL)-10 gene therapy. After preservation ex-vivo at body temperature, the IL-10 treated lungs showed reduced markers of inflammation and improved function (PaO<sub>2</sub> and pulmonary vascular resistance) compared with control untreated lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of transplanted lungs are donated after brain death, although a small portion are donated after circulatory determination of death (DCDD, also known as cardiac death).

When donor lungs are less than ideal (eg, PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> &lt;300 mmHg, radiographic pulmonary edema, DCDD Maastricht score III or IV), several hours of normothermic ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) may allow safe use of these lungs.
