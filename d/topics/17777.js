Urinary frequency and recurrent bladder infections may also occur. </p><p>In 2014, the new term genitourinary syndrome of menopause was introduced by the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health and the North American Menopause Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This term encompasses all of the atrophic symptoms women may have in the vulvovaginal and bladder-urethral areas from loss of estrogen that occurs with menopause. The spectrum of adverse consequences makes long-term treatment essential in many women, not only for relief of symptoms, but also for the more troublesome problems that may occur, such as sexual dysfunction, postcoital bleeding, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Treatment options include both hormonal and nonhormonal interventions.</p><p>Treatment of symptomatic vaginal atrophy is reviewed here. Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of vaginal atrophy, as well as use of estrogen therapy for other menopausal symptoms, are discussed in detail separately. Recent guidelines from the Endocrine Society cover each of these issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Vulvovaginal symptoms include: vaginal dryness, burning, pruritus, dyspareunia, vaginal discharge, bleeding, or spotting. Urinary tract symptoms include dysuria, urinary frequency, urethral discomfort, or, infrequently, hematuria.

There are few data regarding this use, and it is employed depending upon surgeon preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic organ prolapse or urinary incontinence &ndash; Some clinicians treat women with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse or urinary incontinence with estrogen therapy, although the benefit of this approach is uncertain. However, when pessary use is employed in the management of these conditions, estrogen therapy is beneficial to prevent vaginal abrasions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management#H6514468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management&quot;, section on 'Estrogen therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In addition, treatment is indicated in some patients with hypoestrogenism that is not due to menopause (eg, premenarche, lactation, while taking antiestrogenic medications) if symptoms are present (eg, labial adhesions, dyspareunia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vulvovaginal complaints in the prepubertal child&quot;, section on 'Labial adhesions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of sexual pain in women&quot;, section on 'Postpartum'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1275519465\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This section includes an overview of contraindications; detailed information regarding specific treatments is discussed in the sections below.</p><p>Topical nonhormonal treatments (lubricants, moisturizers) are contraindicated only in women with an allergic or adverse reaction to a particular product. Mechanical approaches to treatment are contraindicated only in women in whom such activities would result in injury.</p><p>Use of vaginal estrogen therapy requires caution in women with, or who are at increased risk for, some estrogen-dependent tumors. This type of therapy is considered a reasonable option in appropriately screened women following treatment for endometrial or ovarian cancer, but is controversial in women with breast cancer. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> is aromatized to estrogen, and thus, similar precautions are warranted if testosterone therapy is used. (See <a href=\"#H2203764\" class=\"local\">'Women with breast cancer'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks#H256689856\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;, section on 'Ovarian cancer'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors#H202082795\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of approach to endometrial cancer survivors&quot;, section on 'Menopausal symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2694711\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For symptoms of vaginal dryness or dyspareunia associated with vaginal atrophy, first-line treatments are nonhormonal vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. If these preparations do not provide adequate symptom relief from the woman's perspective, estrogen therapy may be used for women with no contraindications to such therapy. In addition, sexual activity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> use of vaginal dilators may help maintain a healthy vaginal epithelium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MOISTURIZERS AND LUBRICANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of vaginal dryness can be managed by regular use of vaginal moisturizing agents with supplemental use of vaginal lubricants for sexual intercourse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72389\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72389 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. While these agents may improve coital comfort and increase vaginal moisture, they do not reverse most atrophic vaginal changes. Thus, they are useful mostly for women with mild symptoms and those for whom they provide sufficient comfort during coital activity. </p><p>Vaginal moisturizers are intended for use one or more times per week, not just during sexual activity. Many moisturizer products are available; examples include Replens, Me Again, Vagisil Feminine Moisturizer, Feminease, and K-Y SILK-E. </p><p>There are few data regarding the efficacy of vaginal moisturizers. A small randomized trial and a small observational study that compared Replens and a vaginal estrogen preparation reported that relief of vaginal dryness and restoration of normal vaginal pH were similar for both agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In contrast with estrogen, Replens does not affect the vaginal maturation index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In our experience, however, estrogen is more effective than vaginal moisturizers. </p><p>In addition to using a moisturizer on a regular basis, many women also use a lubricant at the time of coitus to decrease irritation. Water soluble products include Astroglide, Slippery Stuff, and K-Y Jelly. Silicone-based lubricants are also available (Pjur Eros, ID Millennium), as well as one oil-based product (Elegance Women's Lubricant). Some clinicians counsel that lubricants with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a> may result in an increased risk of vulvovaginal candidiasis, but there is no evidence to support this and some data suggest that glycerin (also referred to as glycerol) inhibits candidal growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Women should try various products until they find one that meets their needs.</p><p>There are inconsistent data regarding whether products that result in an acidic pH (in premenopausal women, normal vaginal secretions have a pH of 4.0 to 4.5) are more effective. As an example, a randomized trial of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors with vaginal atrophy found that a gel with added lactic acid (pH 4.0) decreased vaginal irritation, dryness and dyspareunia compared with a gel without lactic acid (pH 7.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, a subsequent trial found no improvement in dyspareunia with a pH-balanced gel compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Further study is needed to validate these results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;, section on 'Vaginal pH'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7630789\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANICAL MEASURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who are sexually active with a partner or through masturbation have fewer symptoms related to vaginal atrophy. As an example, a study of 52 postmenopausal women reported significantly less severe vaginal atrophy (as measured by an index of physical examination findings; microscopic or cytologic evaluation was not performed) in those with higher frequency of intercourse (groups were divided into women with 2.42 versus 0.24 episodes of sexual intercourse per week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Serum estrogen levels were not associated with severity of vaginal atrophy. Since vaginal atrophy results in a loss of tissue elasticity, in addition to lubrication, this benefit likely derives from mechanical stretching of the vulvovaginal tissue or increased vaginal blood flow. &#160;</p><p>If appropriate, the clinician may want to alert the patient that sexual activity may improve vaginal function. However, this may not be possible for women in whom dyspareunia precludes sexual activity or who do not have a sexual partner. The type and frequency of sexual activity required to preserve vaginal elasticity and to prevent dyspareunia or stenosis of the vaginal introitus are not known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7630851\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal dilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have contraindications to estrogen therapy and who desire vaginal intercourse may improve vaginal function with the use of vaginal dilators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This is may be particularly effective for women who avoid intercourse due to pain, since vaginal dilators are available in sets of graduated sizes and a narrow dilator can be used initially. Vaginal dilator use can be taught to a woman by her clinician or she can be referred to a pelvic physical therapist. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">VAGINAL ESTROGEN THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estrogen is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe symptoms of vaginal atrophy. Use of estrogen therapy is appropriate for women with symptoms of vaginal atrophy in the setting of low estrogen levels, provided that there are no contraindications to this therapy (eg, certain women with estrogen-dependent tumors). </p><p>Adequate estrogen therapy leads to restoration of the normal vaginal acidic pH and microflora, thickening of the epithelium, increased vaginal secretions, and decreased vaginal dryness. </p><p>In addition, estrogen therapy is associated with urinary tract benefits. These include a reduction in the incidence of urinary tract infections and overactive bladder symptoms. Urgency incontinence and stress incontinence, however, do not improve with estrogen therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;, section on 'Recurrent urinary tract infection'</a>.) </p><p>Given the proven success of estrogen therapy, treatment failure warrants evaluation for other etiologies of the patient's symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9004127\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal versus systemic estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest low dose vaginal estrogen therapy (vaginal administration of a low dose) rather than systemic estrogen therapy (oral, transdermal, or vaginal administration of a higher dose) for women treated solely for vaginal atrophy symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. For women receiving systemic estrogen therapy for other menopausal effects (eg, vasomotor symptoms), low dose vaginal therapy may be added if relief of atrophic symptoms is insufficient.</p><p>We define low dose vaginal estrogen as &le;50 mcg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> or &le;0.3 mg conjugated <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogens/&le;0</span>.5 g cream. A preparation containing only 10 micrograms of estradiol (Vagifem) is effective and can be used in place of somewhat higher doses (ie, &gt;50 microgram estradiol or &gt;0.5 g of conjugated estrogen) if there is concern about small amounts of systemic absorption. Of note, some vaginal preparations administer higher doses of estrogen (eg, higher doses of vaginal creams) and some are intended to deliver systemic doses (eg, Femring, 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]). (See <a href=\"#H325508\" class=\"local\">'Ring'</a> below and <a href=\"#H325522\" class=\"local\">'Creams'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15719545\" class=\"local\">'Systemic absorption'</a> below.)</p><p>The preference for low dose vaginal estrogen therapy is based upon efficacy and risk of systemic effects. Vaginal estrogen therapy appears to be more effective than systemic therapy for treatment of vaginal atrophy. A meta-analysis of 58 comparative studies of women with urogenital atrophy found that patient report of symptom relief was significantly higher for vaginal versus oral estrogen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The reported efficacy rate is approximately 80 to 90 percent for vaginal therapy and 75 percent for systemic therapy, based upon observational data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;, section on 'Systemic estrogens'</a>.)</p><p>Low dose vaginal therapy also avoids or minimizes systemic estrogen effects. The increased risk of breast cancer with systemic estrogen and progestin and thrombosis with systemic estrogen &ndash;(the risk of thrombosis with progestins is controversial) therapy compared with placebo were best demonstrated by the Women's Health Initiative randomized trial; some of these risks vary depending upon whether a progestin is used in combination with estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-for-women-with-inherited-thrombophilias#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling for women with inherited thrombophilias&quot;, section on 'Progestin-only methods'</a>.)</p><p>Potential risks of low dose vaginal estrogen therapy have not been evaluated in well-designed studies. Women using low dose vaginal estrogen therapy have serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> levels, using commonly available estrogen assays that are similar to those who are not taking exogenous estrogen. Therefore, systemic risks are possible, but unlikely. However, with ultrasensitive estradiol assays, small increments of estradiol are observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The risks associated with higher dose vaginal therapy are uncertain, but generally require co-administration of a progestin to prevent endometrial hyperplasia. (See <a href=\"#H15719545\" class=\"local\">'Systemic absorption'</a> below.) </p><p>On the other hand, the low dose vaginal therapy may not be sufficient for relief of vasomotor symptoms or preservation of bone density. However, one study reported a reduction in bone resorption in postmenopausal women receiving low dose vaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> (7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/24</span> hours), which suggests that a systemic effect is possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Vaginal estrogen therapy intended for treatment of vaginal atrophy is sometimes referred to as local estrogen therapy. The North American Menopause Society has stated that for urogenital atrophy alone, local vaginal estrogen therapy is generally recommended and that women treated with systemic therapy should be asked whether they have persistent atrophy symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H325436\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal estrogen preparations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The agents for vaginal estrogen therapy that are commercially available in the United States are conjugated estrogens (cream) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> (cream, insert, and ring) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58506 \">table 2</a>). In Europe and some other countries, estriol cream is also available. </p><p>The dose and duration of treatment needed to improve symptoms vary across patients, and should be individualized according to the woman's degree of vaginal atrophy symptoms. Low dose vaginal estrogen therapy may be used indefinitely, based upon the low risk of adverse effects, although clinical trials to date have not followed women beyond one year. The duration of higher dose vaginal therapy or systemic estrogen therapy should be guided by the risks and benefits of therapy. </p><p>A systematic review of 19 randomized trials including over 4000 women that investigated local estrogen treatment found that creams, inserts, and rings were all similarly effective in relieving symptoms of vaginal atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Systemic absorption, patient preference, convenience, and cost should guide the choice of preparation. </p><p>In our practice, we use cream for women who have symptomatic vulvar atrophy (eg, fissures), so that cream may also be applied to areas of the vulva affected by atrophy. When the vulvar atrophy improves, we switch to a vaginal insert or ring, depending upon patient preference. For other women, we start the vaginal insert and switch to the ring if long-term therapy is desired and if the patient is comfortable with use of the ring. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H326092\"><span class=\"h3\">Insert</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 10 mcg insert of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> (Vagifem) for vaginal use for relief of vaginal symptoms became available in the United States in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/26,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29,30</a>]. This dose replaced the 25 mcg insert that had been in use; the 25 mcg insert has been discontinued. The insert is placed in the vagina daily for the first two weeks of use, and then twice weekly thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Randomized trials have demonstrated that the 10 mcg insert of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> is effective for relief of vaginal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/26,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29,30</a>]. Although the 10 mcg estrogen dose is significantly more effective than placebo therapy, it appears to be slightly less effective than the 25 mcg dose for initially inducing maturation, providing relief of vaginal symptoms, decreasing pH, and improving urogenital atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> insert is inserted into the vagina daily for two weeks and then twice per week thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The primary endpoint was patient-rated severity of dryness or dyspareunia; no difference was found in this measure across the three groups. A secondary measure was the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), which showed significant improvements from baseline in sexual function domains in women treated with 6.5 mg DHEA, but not with 3.25 mg DHEA or lubricant alone. AI therapy did not impact the patient ratings or FSFI results. Serum hormone concentrations and bone turnover were also measured, and will be reported separately. </p><p>There are no data on the safety of prasterone in women with breast cancer who are on aromatase inhibitors.

Also, since the mechanism of action of prasterone is partially the local aromatization of androgen to estrogen, use in women receiving aromatase inhibitors may not be beneficial. Based on the lack of data on safety and efficacy, we suggest not using prasterone in women with breast cancer who are on aromatase inhibitors.

The ring and the 10 mcg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> insert provide the lowest-dose options for vaginal estrogen therapy.

For women who receive higher doses of conjugated estrogens cream (&gt;0.25 g twice weekly) or any dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> cream, we suggest treatment with a progestin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

The safety of ospemifene has not been demonstrated in women with a prior history or an increased risk of breast cancer or in women with an increased risk of thromboembolism. (See <a href=\"#H2475847\" class=\"local\">'Ospemifene'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A vaginal laser is available for potential treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy. However, there are insufficient data to support its efficacy and safety. (See <a href=\"#H449437730\" class=\"local\">'Laser'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-line treatment of symptoms of vaginal atrophy in women with breast cancer includes non-hormonal options (lubricants, moisturizers). We suggest <strong>not</strong> using vaginal estrogen therapy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasterone-intravaginal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vaginal prasterone</a> therapy for women who are on aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Use of low dose vaginal estrogen or vaginal prasterone in other women with breast cancer who are at a low risk of recurrence is reasonable. This should be only done in collaboration with the patient's oncologist and after explanation of potential risks to the patient.
