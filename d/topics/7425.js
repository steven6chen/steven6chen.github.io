The natural history of a food allergy includes information on the acquisition of the allergy, the likelihood that it will be outgrown, and its usual duration.</p><p>Food allergy most often begins in the first two years of life. Certain food allergies, such as those to cow's milk and hen's egg, are usually outgrown during childhood or adolescence, whereas peanut and tree nut allergies are more likely to persist into adulthood.</p><p>This topic review provides an overview of the natural history of food allergy in children. The clinical manifestations and treatment of food allergy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF FOOD ALLERGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this section, the terms &quot;allergy&quot; and &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; are used interchangeably to refer to an abnormal immunologic reaction to food. Such reactions can be mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) molecules directed against specific food proteins that activate mast cells and basophils or can arise from other cellular processes involving eosinophils or T cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE OF CHILDHOOD FOOD ALLERGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than one-third of parents will report adverse food reactions in their young children, although the rates of verifiable food allergy are much lower. Food sensitization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> allergy are present in 5 to 10 percent of young children, with peak prevalence at approximately one year of age. Studies that measure sensitization to food allergens can overestimate the prevalence of true allergic reactions to foods because not all sensitized children will develop symptoms upon ingestion.</p><p>Most food allergy is acquired in the first or second year of life. The peak prevalence of food allergy is approximately 6 to 8 percent at one year of age, although rates as high as 10 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. It then falls progressively until late childhood, after which the prevalence remains stable at approximately 3 to 4 percent. The prevalence of food allergy in children (aged 0 to 17 years) has slowly increased in the United States, from 3.4 percent in 1997 to 1999 to 5.1 percent in 2009 to 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Parentally perceived food allergy is common in early childhood, with up to one-third of parents reporting one or more adverse food reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. Parentally reported adverse food reactions were assessed with a prospective study of 3623 children followed from birth until the age of two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/6,7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,12</a>]. Parents completed questionnaires at six-month intervals. The cumulative incidence of adverse food reactions was 35 percent by age two years. Cow's milk, fruits (especially citrus and strawberry), and vegetables (especially tomato) accounted for nearly two-thirds of all reported reactions. Cow's milk was the single food item most commonly incriminated, with a cumulative incidence of 12 percent. Other problematic foods reported by parents included egg (4.4 percent), fish (3 percent), nuts (2.1 percent), and cereals (1.4 percent). The overall duration of food reactivity was short, with approximately two-thirds of the reactions resolving within six months of their onset. The probable explanation for the brief duration of most of these reactions is the commonplace nature of irritant, nonimmunologic food reactions in infants and young children. Mild perioral rashes after eating tomatoes or berries are examples, although immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergies to these foods are also possible.</p><p>Variable criteria are used to measure food allergy. In studying IgE-mediated allergy, some researchers examine rates of &quot;sensitization,&quot; or the presence of IgE directed against a specific food, as detected by in vivo (skin testing) or in vitro testing for specific IgE (often called radioallergosorbent testing, or RAST, though nowadays the test uses fluorescence rather than radioactivity and is termed FEIA for fluorescent-enzyme immunoassay). This is distinct from clinical reactivity, which is the development of symptoms on exposure to a food, as assessed by history or challenge. This distinction occurs because not all patients with detectable food-specific IgE antibodies will have a reaction when the food is ingested. Less commonly, patients may have clear histories of food-allergic reactions with low or undetectable levels of food-specific IgE. Thus, studies measuring sensitization to food allergens may overestimate the prevalence of true food allergy.</p><p>The German Multicenter Allergy Study followed the development of sensitization to common food allergens in a large cohort of children, without clinical confirmation of food reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. A total of 216 children from a birth cohort of 4082 children were assessed with serum food-specific IgE testing approximately yearly. The overall annual incidence rates for food sensitization decreased from a peak of 10 percent at age one year to 3 percent at age six years. Sensitization to hen's egg and cow's milk were most common, with peak prevalence rates of approximately 6 percent at age one year, followed by wheat and soy.</p><p>In contrast, the rates of food allergy are significantly lower if allergy is defined by verified clinical reactivity upon ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. As an example, a cohort of 1749 children was followed from birth to determine the prevalence of cow's milk allergy (CMA) during the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The children were evaluated by history, milk elimination, oral challenge, and skin prick tests or serum food-specific IgE testing. A confirmed reactivity rate of 2.2 percent was reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H198908113\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATION WITH SUBSEQUENT ASTHMA AND ALLERGIC RHINITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Young children who are sensitized to foods or have confirmed immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy are more likely than their nonallergic peers to develop allergic rhinitis and asthma later on. This association between early food allergy and later atopic respiratory conditions has been noted in multiple studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/13,16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,18,19</a>]. A child with food allergy has between a 50 and 90 percent chance of subsequently developing asthma. Young children who are sensitized to food in infancy, particularly egg, often develop subsequent sensitization to aeroallergens. In one study, a serum radioallergosorbent testing (RAST) result for egg &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> at age 12 months was 99 percent specific and had a 77 percent positive predictive value for sensitization to respiratory allergens by three years, even in the absence of other risk factors, such as family history of atopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF RESOLUTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of childhood food allergies are lost over time, although the process of resolution varies a great deal among different foods and individual patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms by which food allergy resolves are not fully understood, and it is likely that multiple mechanisms are involved. Food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels tend to fall over time in most patients with food allergy, and this loss of IgE is the best known predictor of the development of clinical tolerance. However, it is also clear that some patients become tolerant even with persistently elevated food-specific IgE levels, and thus, loss of IgE is not a requirement for, or even the primary mechanism of, the resolution of food allergy in these patients. Other humoral changes, including increased levels of allergen-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA), may also play a role. Alternately, cellular changes, such as the induction of T regulatory cells, may be important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strict dietary avoidance of the foods to which a child is allergic has been a mainstay of food allergy management. While prior recommendations suggested that strict avoidance might increase the chance of outgrowing an allergy or hasten resolution, there were few studies to support this idea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>], and more recent studies focused on the introduction of extensively heated milk and egg suggest the opposite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p>Clinician-supervised oral food challenges are often required to determine if an allergy has resolved. Clinical experience suggests that food challenges that result in an allergic reaction do not alter the natural course of resolution of food allergy, and one study demonstrated that neither food-specific IgE levels or skin tests changed with either accidental or intentional exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Studies of oral food challenges reveal that individuals vary with regard to the threshold amount of food that triggers a reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, strict avoidance is generally advised, rather than having patients ingest an allergen in subthreshold amounts, because patients may accidentally consume a larger amount than intended and elicit an allergic reaction.</p><p>Some children who react to whole egg (eg, scrambled) or dairy (eg, liquid milk, yogurt) can tolerate extensively heated forms of these allergens in smaller quantities in foods, such as baked muffins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Data suggest that allowing this &quot;less strict&quot; avoidance hastens the development of tolerance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;, section on 'How strict must avoidance be?'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=egg-allergy-management#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Egg allergy: Management&quot;, section on 'Avoidance'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milk-allergy-management#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Milk allergy: Management&quot;, section on 'Avoidance'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients demonstrate sensitization to a food that they consume (eg, a positive allergen prick skin test or elevated specific serum IgE), but they do not have a clear history of reactions to that food. Several small case series have reported that invoking strict avoidance of the food occasionally results in acute and severe reactions to the self-same food upon reintroduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. This phenomenon may represent a loss of a desensitized state to a food that was maintained while it was being regularly ingested. While there are no formal studies assessing the risk of occurrence of this uncommon outcome, decisions regarding removal of foods from the diet (eg, in patients with suspected food-triggered atopic dermatitis) need to consider this possibility. No foods should be removed from the diet based solely on a positive test result.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING THE FOOD-ALLERGIC CHILD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The food-allergic child must be followed regularly by both the pediatrician and allergist to assure that growth is normal and that adequate nutrition is being provided. The allergist should review all accidental exposures and food reactions in order to assure that avoidance measures are adequate, reactions are recognized promptly and treated appropriately, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjectors are current and available to the child in all settings (if appropriate), and that the patient and caregivers understand the management plan. Just as importantly, accidental exposures that did not result in reactions should be assessed with hopes that the allergy is resolving. It is usually reasonable to proceed with an oral food challenge to determine if the allergy has resolved in a patient who has tolerated a larger accidental exposure, even if in vitro or skin prick test results have not improved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Serial testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The allergist should evaluate the child at regular intervals to determine if the allergy has been outgrown. This is usually done yearly; however, longer or shorter intervals may be more appropriate in some situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. As examples, a child with a reaction to fruit might be evaluated every six months, and an older child with persistent peanut allergy may not need annual testing after the first few years if there is no indication of improvement. In general, the higher the food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), the less likely the child is to become tolerant over time.</p><p>Reevaluation can be accomplished with in vitro testing, skin prick testing, and information on accidental exposures. The optimal method of monitoring specific food allergies has not yet been determined, and various approaches can be used. We use the clinical history and in vitro testing (eg, fluorescent-enzyme immunoassay [FEIA] such as ImmunoCAP) to follow patients in our clinic. We generally do not perform repeat skin testing, as we feel it does not change our management in the majority of cases. However, other centers do use skin testing, especially in making decisions about whether or not to proceed to an oral challenge.</p><p>In vitro testing for allergic disease is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-in-vitro-allergy-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of in vitro allergy tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining if an allergy has resolved</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supervised food challenge is recommended to prove that the condition has been outgrown because negative tests do not guarantee loss of allergy with absolute certainty and positive tests can persist even after an allergy has resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. These must be performed with caution and with full emergency equipment and medications on hand to treat possible reactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If there is no interim history to suggest a recent reaction, then we recommend the following reevaluation for children with specific childhood food allergies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Cow's milk and egg</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgE-mediated allergies to milk and egg are usually lost gradually throughout childhood and adolescence. We retest yearly with CAP-FEIA testing. The rate of decline can help predict the likelihood that a challenge will be negative. We usually offer challenge to milk and egg when the specific IgE level is &le;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L,</span> which gives the patient an approximately 50 percent chance of passing the challenge in our patient population. However, positive predictive values for both specific IgE and skin prick testing may vary depending on the population studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Lower cutoffs may be used for children under two years of age. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cow's milk'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Hen's egg'</a> below.)</p><p>Non-IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy (CMA) tends to be outgrown more quickly, and a careful challenge is warranted by the age of two to three years if there have been no recent reactions from accidental exposures. Reintroduction of food in dietary or food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), in particular, is associated with significant risk. Challenges in patients with FPIES who were very ill upon presentation should be performed under close supervision in a hospital setting. This is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Peanut or tree nut</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend repeat testing yearly with CAP-FEIA testing. Patients with tree nut (TN)- or peanut (PN)-IgE level &le;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> should be offered a supervised challenge. If negative, the patient should be advised to ingest nut at least once a week. The optimal amount of nut that patients should eat monthly is unknown. We therefore suggest that they ingest a serving (eg, the amount in a peanut butter sandwich or nut-containing candy bar). Patients should be followed for at least another year to assure that there are no recurrent symptoms.</p><p>In patients with persistent allergy, or if the CAP-FEIA remains unchanged for several years, testing can be performed less frequently over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Wheat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wheat-specific IgE level predictive of clinical reactivity has not been determined, due to poor performance characteristics of the IgE assay for this allergen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Proposed challenge decision points range from 20 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/34,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,37</a>]. In one survey, 60 percent of patients with a wheat IgE level &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> passed their challenges, and 50 percent of those with a wheat IgE level of &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> passed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Peak wheat-specific IgE has some predictive value in determining the age at which tolerance develops, and higher levels may indicate risk of persistent allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Wheat allergy'</a> below.)</p><p>We suggest that patients with wheat allergy or sensitization undergo serial oral challenges to wheat at least every two years in the absence of an interval history of symptoms triggered by an exposure. Additional variables to take into consideration before proceeding with the challenge include the wheat-specific IgE level and how it compares with the level at the time of the last challenge, the result of the last challenge (eg, did the reaction occur at the beginning or near the end of the challenge, and what was the severity of the reaction?), and the age of the child (eg, resolution may occur at later ages but is more likely to occur in a two-year time span in a younger child).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Soy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend repeat evaluation yearly with CAP-FEIA testing. These allergies are generally outgrown more quickly than those to egg or milk. Challenge can be offered when the results of in vitro testing have reached low levels, although these are not as well defined as for the previous foods, and the situation is probably similar to that for wheat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Other foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yearly in vitro testing is our general recommendation. As mentioned previously, repeat evaluation can be less frequent with time if there is minimal evidence of improvement over several years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY OF SPECIFIC ALLERGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues relating to prevalence, resolution, and recurrences of food allergy are best understood with respect to the specific food. The most reliable information concerns allergies to cow's milk, hen's egg, <span class=\"nowrap\">peanut/tree</span> nuts, and wheat. The natural history of other food allergies, such as allergies to soy and sesame, has been less well studied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Cow's milk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is the most common food allergy among infants and young children. Resolution is gradual throughout childhood and adolescence and is influenced by various factors.</p><p>Up to 50 percent of children with CMA also have concomitant adverse reactions to other foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In addition, 50 to 80 percent have allergic rhinitis and asthma in response to inhaled environmental allergens by puberty.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMA affects approximately 2.5 percent of children during the first two years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/7,16,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16,39</a>]. One of the best studies of CMA prevalence is the large, prospective, Danish study reviewed previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. CMA was confirmed in 2.2 percent of children followed from birth through age three years. Of note, nearly one-half of these cases were non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic conditions, such as dietary protein-induced <span class=\"nowrap\">proctitis/colitis,</span> enteropathy, and enterocolitis. The estimated overall prevalence of CMA in the United States in a national survey was 0.4 percent, based upon serologic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Concomitant allergic rhinitis and asthma and onset of the allergy at &lt;1 month of age may also be risk factors for persistent food allergies.</p><p>Resolution rates for IgE-mediated CMA are significantly lower than those of non-IgE-mediated milk allergy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study followed 98 children (median age 24 months) with CMA (approximately two-thirds with IgE-mediated allergy and one-third with non-IgE mediated allergy) for a median of two years (range: 6 to 72 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Twenty-two percent of those with IgE-mediated allergy became tolerant, whereas 59 percent of those with non-IgE-mediated CMA became tolerant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study followed 139 children with CMA (aged 14 months to 18 years at the end of the study) for an average of seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Sixty-six of the children had IgE-mediated CMA. In the whole group, CMA resolved in 34 percent by age 2 years, 55 percent by age 5, and 68 percent by age 10. However, tolerance was delayed in the subgroup of children with IgE-mediated CMA, with resolution occurring in none of these children by age 2 years, 22 percent by age 5, and 43 percent by age 10.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Danish study previously described, 76 percent of those with IgE-mediated allergy had become cow's milk tolerant, and 100 percent of those with non-IgE-mediated allergy were tolerant by age three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Of note, these rates of resolution were much higher than those in subsequent studies and may be due to the recruitment of affected children from the general population, in whom the range of disease severity is likely to be broad.</p><p/><p>Resolution rates vary in different study populations. Rates of resolution in children with IgE-mediated CMA followed in allergy practices are lower than those of children in the general population, probably because these children are more severely allergic, although other confounders have not been excluded. One large, retrospective study reported resolution rates in 807 children with CMA who were followed by allergy specialists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If resolution was defined as passing a challenge procedure or having a cow's milk-specific IgE (CM-IgE) of &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> and no reactions within the past year, CMA resolved in 19, 42, 64, and 79 percent of children at ages 4, 8, 12, and 16 years, respectively.</p><p>Finally, several clinical features are associated with persistent IgE-mediated CMA, including the presence of concomitant allergic rhinitis, asthma, or moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and onset of the allergy in the first month of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/24,40,41,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,40,41,43</a>].

Sixty-one percent of patients with persistent CMA had asthma compared with 19 percent in the resolution group.

In the retrospective study discussed previously, persistence was more likely in patients with higher initial levels of CM-IgE. Median CM-IgE in the first two years of life was 19 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> in the children with CMA that persisted compared with 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> in those with CMA that eventually resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, CM-IgE levels in persistent CMA tended to increase over the first three to four years of life and then gradually decrease, while those in resolving CMA were stable initially and then gradually declined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F73825\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73825 \">figure 1</a>). Similarly, in a prospective series of 293 children aged 3 to 15 months with milk allergy, 72 percent (88 of 122) with a baseline CM-IgE &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> had resolved milk allergy compared with only 23 percent (19 of 82) of those with baseline CM-IgE &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Another study examined the rate of change in levels of CM-IgE over time, in relation to the patient's age, in children who developed CMA before the age of four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. CM-IgE levels decreased more rapidly in those who developed tolerance. Independent of initial levels, the percentage amount that CM-IgE dropped in one year correlated with the likelihood that the child would pass a food challenge performed at that time.

In the general population, wheat allergy resolves in 80 percent of patients by five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. However, tolerance appears to develop more slowly in a highly atopic population followed at a tertiary care center, as is seen in similar populations with cow's milk and hen's egg allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>A retrospective study examined the natural course of IgE-mediated wheat allergy in 103 children followed at a large referral center from 1993 to 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Oral challenges to wheat were performed in 61 percent during the study period. The median age at which tolerance was acquired was 6.6 years. However, the median age at resolution varied considerably depending upon peak wheat IgE (approximately 2, 4, and 10 years of age for children with peak wheat IgE levels &lt;20, 20 to 50, and &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L,</span> respectively). Overall, tolerance was achieved by 29, 56, and 70 percent at 4, 8, and 14 years of age, respectively. In children aged two to eight years, the median wheat IgE levels associated with resolved allergy ranged from 21 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L,</span> whereas the median levels associated with persistent allergy ranged from 62 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span>. Patients with wheat sensitization (wheat IgE &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> but no history of symptomatic exposure) passed challenges at rates similar to the children discussed above who had a history of symptomatic wheat allergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h3\">Summary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgE-mediated wheat allergy affects 0.4 to 1 percent of the pediatric population. The majority of cases resolve by adolescence. The pediatrician treating the general population can expect high rates of resolution, whereas allergy specialists with referred patient populations should anticipate lower resolution rates. We suggest serial oral challenges to wheat at least every two years, regardless of specific IgE level, in the absence of an interval history of symptoms triggered by an exposure. The decision to proceed with an oral food challenge in these patients is also based upon the severity of any prior reactions and how recent those reactions were. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Wheat'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Other foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of other food allergies is less well studied.</p><p>Earlier studies suggested that soy allergy is typically outgrown in the preschool-age years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/16,78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,78-80</a>]. However, a subsequent, larger, retrospective study performed at a tertiary referral clinic found that only approximately 50 percent of children had outgrown soy allergy by seven years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Soy allergy resolved in 25, 45, and 69 percent by age 4, 6, and 10 years, respectively.</p><p>The limited data available suggests that sesame allergy, similar to peanut and tree nut allergies, is more likely to persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-84</a>]. The reported rate of resolution of sesame allergy ranges from 20 to 30 percent.</p><p>In one series of 30 children with lentil allergy, the median age of onset was 1.5 years, and the allergy had resolved in 50 percent by 3.5 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>As mentioned previously, adverse reactions to fruits, vegetables, and other cereal grains are typically very short-lived in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution/abstract/50,80,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,80,86</a>]. Many of these reactions may represent intolerances or irritant reactions rather than true allergy, and most children will lose their sensitivity to these foods within a period of 6 to 12 months. A minority of children have severe, IgE-mediated allergies to these foods that may persist over time, however.</p><p>There are few studies addressing the natural history of seafood (fish and shellfish) allergies.

By late childhood, the prevalence is 2 to 4 percent and remains stable thereafter. Food-allergic children are at high risk for developing later allergic rhinitis and asthma.

Non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated milk allergy is a transient childhood condition that is almost always outgrown but must be managed carefully as challenge can be hazardous. IgE-mediated milk allergy may persist into adolescence, although it is usually outgrown by adulthood.

It is likely to be a lifelong disorder for most patients, although 20 to 25 percent outgrow peanut and at least 9 percent outgrow tree nut allergies. Recurrence is rare, although a few cases have been documented.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring the food-allergic child'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most allergy experts use a combination of historical information from accidental exposures and periodic in vitro <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin testing. As an example, a challenge may be offered at a higher specific IgE level if there is a history of a recent accidental exposure without a reaction. Alternatively, a challenge will not be offered when the specific IgE is below the designated cutoff level if the patient has had a recent exposure that triggered a reaction. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Serial testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medically supervised food challenge is recommended to confirm that a food allergy has resolved as in vitro and skin tests can remain positive in patients who achieve clinical tolerance and, conversely, tests can become negative in patients who still react upon ingestion, although the latter situation is uncommon. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Determining if an allergy has resolved'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For IgE-mediated CMA, we repeat in vitro milk-specific IgE testing (eg, ImmunoCAP) yearly and offer challenge when the level is &le;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span>. At this level, the pass rate is approximately 50 percent. However, performance of challenges to extensively heated (baked) milk should be considered on an individual basis since many patients with higher IgE levels may tolerate milk protein in this form.
