Prone ventilation is ventilation that is delivered with the patient lying in the prone position. Prone ventilation may be used for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) mostly as a strategy to improve oxygenation when more traditional modes of ventilation fail (eg, lung protective ventilation). </p><p>The physiologic effects of, selection of patients for, and the outcomes associated with prone ventilation are reviewed here. Approaches to mechanical ventilation and supportive care for patients with ARDS are described separately.

Prone ventilation is NOT considered a mode of mechanical ventilation. Volume-controlled and pressure-controlled modes of ventilation are the typical modes of ventilation that are delivered in the prone position. Other modes of ventilation including high frequency ventilation and other methods of improving gas exchange (eg, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) are not generally administered in the prone position but may be used in conjunction with prone positioning. Modes of mechanical ventilation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High-frequency ventilation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS ON OXYGENATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prone position alters the mechanics and physiology of gas exchange to result consistently in improved oxygenation. The improvement of oxygenation during prone ventilation is multifactorial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54334\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54334 \">table 1</a>). Prone positioning improves gas exchange by ameliorating the ventral-dorsal transpulmonary pressure difference, reducing dorsal lung compression, and improving lung perfusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76840 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F108807\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108807 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>Increased functional residual capacity (FRC) has also been proposed, but changes in FRC have not been a dominant finding in most studies of prone ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Changes in the distribution of extravascular lung water and secretions may also play a role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Reducing ventral-dorsal transpulmonary pressure difference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distending pressure across the lung is estimated by the transpulmonary pressure (Ptp), which is defined as the difference between the airway pressure (Paw) and pleural pressure (Ppl); Ptp = Paw &ndash; Ppl. The difference between ventral and dorsal Ptp appears to be favorably affected by prone positioning.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The effects of supine</strong> <strong>positioning</strong> &ndash; When an individual is supine, the dorsal Ppl is greater than ventral Ppl. As a result, the ventral Ptp exceeds the dorsal Ptp and there is greater expansion of the ventral alveoli than the dorsal alveoli. This effect is exaggerated in supine patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), probably because the difference between the dorsal and ventral pleural pressures is increased by the excess lung weight. The result is a tendency towards overinflation of the ventral alveoli and atelectasis of the dorsal alveoli (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60461\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60461 \">image 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The effects of prone positioning</strong> &ndash; Prone positioning reduces the difference between the dorsal and ventral Ptp, making ventilation more homogeneous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], leading to a decrease in ventral alveolar overinflation and dorsal alveolar collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As a result, reduced alveolar distension limits ventilator-associated lung injury from overdistention and cyclic atelectasis. Prone ventilation also recruits (ie, opens) alveoli that had collapsed during the supine ventilation, a process that may continue over time when the patient is lying prone while receiving appropriate positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). The result is improved ventilation and oxygenation, which many patients sustain even after they return to the supine position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/1,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-9</a>].

The latter is caused by the abdominal contents displacing the diaphragm cranially, which can be exacerbated by a loss of diaphragmatic tone due to sedation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paralysis or increased abdominal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Compression by either the heart <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the diaphragm may exaggerate dependent lung collapse in the supine position, increasing hypoxemia (ie, worsening shunt) and ventilator-associated lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The effects of prone positioning</strong> &ndash; During prone ventilation, the heart becomes dependent, lying on the sternum, potentially decreasing medial posterior lung compression. In addition, the diaphragm is displaced caudally (especially in obese patients and when the abdomen is left unsupported), decreasing compression of the posterior-caudal lung parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In addition, increases in cardiac output have been observed and thought to be due to the effect of increased lung recruitment and reduction in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction resulting in increases in right ventricular preload and decreased right ventricular afterload and a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/6,15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15-19</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p>It was previously hypothesized that prone ventilation permits the redistribution of blood flow based on gravitational gradient. However, there is little evidence to support this belief, with most studies indicating that the blood flow pattern changes only modestly upon turning prone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Even with similar degrees of dependent atelectatic alveoli, the shunt fraction is decreased and oxygen tension will generally be higher in the prone patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2165884283\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consistently, most trials demonstrate improved oxygenation with ventilation in the prone position.

Among patients whose oxygenation improves during prone ventilation, some continue to have improved oxygenation for hours after they return to the supine position and many improve each time prone ventilation is repeated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68711\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68711 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/8,9,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,27</a>]. </p><p>Most patients who demonstrate a response do so within the first hour but delayed responses beyond that have been observed.</p><p>For example, in an uncontrolled trial of 13 patients with moderate to severe ARDS, two-thirds of patients had a sustained response defined as a 10 mmHg increase in PaO<sub>2</sub> over the first 30 minutes of prone ventilation that predicted a sustained increase in PaO<sub>2</sub> over the next two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Early randomized trials and meta-analyses initially reported no mortality benefit with prone positioning for patients with ARDS in general [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/32-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-39</a>]. Since then, one large randomized trial (PROSEVA) and several meta-analyses (some of which included PROSEVA and some of which did not) have reported mortality benefits from early, high-dose prone ventilation in the subpopulation of patients with severe ARDS (defined by them as PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> &lt;150 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/26,40-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,40-45</a>]. Separate meta-analyses that included PROSEVA additionally suggested that the improved survival from prone ventilation is only observed in those who concomitantly receive low, but not high, tidal volume ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/37,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,44</a>]. While encouraging, a second randomized trial will be needed to validate this mortality benefit. </p><p>The benefit of prone ventilation in the subpopulation with severe ARDS who are mechanically ventilated with low tidal volumes is best supported by a single large randomized trial of early (within 33 hours of intubation), high-dose (17 consecutive hours) prone ventilation (PROSEVA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This trial of 466 patients receiving low tidal volume mechanical ventilation for severe ARDS (PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> &lt;150 mmHg, FiO<sub>2</sub> &ge;0.6, PEEP &ge;5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), reported that, compared with patients ventilated in the supine position, patients receiving prone ventilation (average time spent prone: 73 percent) had a reduction in 28-day mortality (16 versus 33 percent; hazard ratio [HR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.25-0.63) and 90-day mortality (24 versus 41 percent; HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.29-0.67, respectively). The mortality benefit occurred without excess risk of complications. In addition, patients in the prone group needed less rescue therapy including ECMO (1 versus 26 percent) or inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitric oxide</a> (10 versus 16 percent). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prone procedure'</a> below.)</p><p>Important limitations in this trial (PROSEVA) that may have affected the outcome or limit its generalizability are the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intervention was applied to a highly selective group of patients that represent only a minority of patients with ARDS. Of the 1434 patients with severe ARDS screened, 858 were not eligible on the basis of exclusion criteria alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68536\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68536 \">table 2</a>). An additional 107 patients were excluded prior to randomization due to improvement after a predefined 12 to 24 hour window, organizational issues, or withdrawal by their physician. Thus, the mortality benefit likely applies to a small select group of patient with ARDS. (See <a href=\"#H1026448171\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The list of exclusion criteria was lengthy and included elevated intracranial pressure, spinal or other fracture instability, massive hemoptysis, deep venous thrombosis treated for less than two days, a mean arterial pressure less than 65 mmHg, anterior chest tube with leaks, chronic oxygen-dependent respiratory failure, use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitric oxide</a> or almitrine bismesylate, or ECMO before inclusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68536\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68536 \">table 2</a>). Thus, patient selection for prone positioning appears to be important in determining a good outcome. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite randomization, patient groups were not matched. Patients ventilated in the supine position had higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores and were receiving more pressors, suggesting they were a sicker population of patients that may have biased the outcome. In addition, more patients in the prone group received neuromuscular blocking agents, which may have favorably affected the outcome.

However, for patients with severe ARDS who fail to improve despite use of such ventilatory strategies, we suggest a trial of prone ventilation, provided there is no contraindication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68536\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68536 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Prone ventilation may also be used on a trial basis in patients with ARDS who have refractory hypoxemia that is unresponsive to multiple attempts at optimizing ventilator settings (eg, lung protection plus permissive hypercapnia) or as a bridge to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Prone positioning does not appear to consistently benefit those with mild or moderate ARDS. </p><p>Our view that prone ventilation be reserved as a rescue therapy in this population is based upon one randomized trial that showed a mortality benefit (PROSEVA), where there was a 12 to 24 hour stabilization period using a supine lung protective strategy before the initiation of prone ventilation in patients with severe ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] (see <a href=\"#H2165884283\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above).

In the one randomized study that showed a mortality benefit for prone positioning in severe ARDS (PROSEVA), the mean duration of time in the prone position was 17 hours per day with an average of four sessions in total per patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Usually a response is noted during the first hour of the initial trial but longer periods (eg, 12 to 18 hours) are appropriate to ensure a response, provided no life-threatening hypoxemia is present. Importantly, if prone ventilation fails (eg, no change in the patient's gas exchange or lung mechanics, a worsening of gas exchange or cardiovascular status), the patient should be returned to the supine position and alternate strategies for improving oxygenation (eg, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) should be pursued.

The frequency of pressure ulcers does not appear to be different with prone ventilation but rather occurs in different locations such as the anterior shoulder and chest, knee, and face. Risk factors for pressure ulcers mostly relate to time spent prone but male gender, age &ge;60 years, and body mass index &lt;28.4 may also increase the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation-for-adult-patients-with-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

In that trial, the rate of expected complications (eg, unplanned extubation, endotracheal tube obstruction, hemoptysis, arterial desaturations, bradycardia and severe hypotension) was no different between the groups. Supine patients had a higher rate of cardiac arrest, which could be explained by the higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores in this group.
