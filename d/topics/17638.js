Treatment-emergent CSA is defined as the persistence or emergence of central apneas and hypopneas during the initiation of PAP therapy without a backup respiratory rate for obstructive OSA, despite significant resolution of obstructive respiratory events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Alternative definitions of treatment-emergent CSA have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>], but they all share the presence of new or increased central apneas and hypopneas that prevent the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from normalizing despite the disappearance of obstructive apneas and hypopneas.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, clinical findings, diagnostic criteria, and management of treatment-emergent CSA are reviewed here.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) therapy immediately reduce the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of patients with OSA. However, they do not reduce the AHI of patients with treatment-emergent CSA due to the appearance of central apneas.</p><p>By contrast, the existence of numerous potential mechanisms by which treatment of OSA may induce central apneas suggests that treatment-emergent CSA and OSA are not separate disorders, but rather that the central apneas that characterize treatment-emergent CSA are merely an effect of treating the OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loop gain &ndash; Loop gain refers to the ratio of a corrective ventilatory response to a disturbance. If the response exceeds the disturbance (ie, loop gain &gt;1), then self-sustaining periodic breathing with central apneas may result. Patients with OSA frequently exhibit &quot;high loop gain&quot; or &quot;ventilatory instability&quot; at baseline, which is augmented by PAP therapy. As a result, minor disturbances (eg, arousals from sleep) result in an exuberant corrective ventilatory response (ie, hyperpnea) and then central apnea if the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) falls below the apneic threshold. The central apnea, in turn, prompts a reciprocal corrective response, establishing a pattern of periodic breathing. High loop gain is more prevalent in patients with severe OSA than those with mild OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], as well as in patients who receive BPAP rather than CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermittent hypoxia &ndash; Acute intermittent hypoxia is associated with increased chemoreflex sensitivity and increased propensity to develop central apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This may explain the higher likelihood of developing treatment-emergent CSA during split-night versus full-night PAP titration studies. Likewise, chronic intermittent hypoxia, as in OSA, is associated with increased peripheral chemoreflex activity. Accordingly, patients with OSA are more susceptible to the development of hypocapnic central apnea secondary to increased CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflex sensitivity relative to healthy control subjects. Treatment with nasal CPAP is associated with decreased chemoreflex sensitivity and decreased propensity to develop central apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air leak &ndash; Air leak during PAP titration may be associated with the development of acute central apnea, owing to CO<sub>2</sub> washout from the mask and the anatomic dead space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CO<sub>2</sub>excretion &ndash; Positive airway pressure therapy relieves repetitive upper airway obstruction, which increases the elimination of CO<sub>2</sub>, lowers the PaCO<sub>2</sub>, and induces central apnea if the PaCO<sub>2</sub> falls below the apneic threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/10,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18-20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stretch receptor activation &ndash; PAP therapy activates stretch receptors, which inhibits central respiratory output and causes central apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>While these mechanisms directly link PAP therapy to the development of central apneas, it is important to realize that other factors may contribute in some situations. These include loss of the wakefulness stimulus to breath during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], baseline hypocapnia due to heart failure or high altitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and concomitant hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16270696\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9126221\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment-emergent central sleep apnea (CSA) typically presents as an incidental polysomnographic finding during the initial in-laboratory titration of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy (or bilevel positive airway pressure without a backup respiratory rate) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Specifically, central apneas and hypopneas emerge or increase during the titration, which prevent the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from normalizing despite the disappearance of obstructive apneas and hypopneas. The treatment-emergent apneas almost invariably occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/1,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22,23</a>].</p><p>Less commonly, treatment-emergent CSA begins after several months of PAP therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9126308\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an increased number of central apneas while being treated with PAP may remain asymptomatic or manifest symptoms and signs of disrupted sleep due to the central apneas and accompanying arousals.

In observational studies, central events resolve spontaneously in 50 to 75 percent of patients who return for repeat polysomnography after several months of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/2,4,5,7,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5,7,25,26</a>]. Similar numbers were reported in the CPAP arm of a small randomized trial, in which approximately two-thirds of patients with treatment-emergent CSA achieved an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &lt;10 per hour after 90 days of CPAP therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This proportion improved to 73 percent when limited to patients who were adherent with therapy.</p><p>Confidence in these estimates remains somewhat limited by the retrospective nature of most studies and the significant number of patients lost to follow-up, which might lead to an overestimation of the true rate of spontaneous improvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18678874\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of treatment-emergent central sleep apnea (CSA) is controversial, and treatment recommendations are derived from clinical experience, small observational studies, and a limited number of small randomized trials. Since many patients improve spontaneously after several months of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, expectant management with CPAP is appropriate in most cases.</p><p>In patients who do not improve, options include changing the mode of positive airway pressure to either adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) with a backup rate. If these modes are unavailable or too costly, however, continuing CPAP is preferable to discontinuing the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) altogether.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13424170\"><span class=\"h2\">Expectant management with CPAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with treatment-emergent CSA, we suggest expectant management with CPAP therapy, which includes repeat clinical evaluation and diagnostic sleep testing with patients wearing their device in two to three months. This approach is supported by retrospective and limited prospective data showing that central apneas improve or resolve spontaneously in approximately two-thirds of patients who continue CPAP for 90 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16270712\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p>As part of expectant management, patients should be evaluated for comorbidities and medications that may increase the likelihood of central apneas. This includes optimization of the heart failure regimen in patients with symptomatic heart failure and rigorous assessment of the need for continuing opioid therapy in patients taking opioids.</p><p>Predictors of persistent central apneas on continued CPAP are not well defined, and clinical symptoms may or may not be present. Repeat polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) is therefore required after two to three months to determine whether further changes are necessary, considering that limited data suggest that ASV or bilevel PAP with a backup rate may be more effective in controlling CPAP-emergent central apneas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Clinical symptoms and adherence should be reassessed at this time as well.</p><p>The decision to continue CPAP therapy or change to an alternative mode of ventilation should be made based upon the persistence of CPAP-emergent central apneas, the stability of the patient&rsquo;s medical condition (such as coexistent heart failure), and the severity of sleep-related symptoms. Data in heart failure patients with CSA suggest that improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction and transplant-free survival are dependent upon adequate suppression of central apneas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1043268267\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative modes of ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ASV and BPAP with a backup rate are alternative modes of ventilation in patients with persistent central apneas on CPAP. The data reviewed below suggest that both ASV and BPAP with a backup respiratory rate decrease the frequency of obstructive and central apnea and hypopneas, but ASV may have a slightly larger magnitude of effect. In addition, limited longer-term data suggest that re-emergence of central events may be of concern with BPAP but not ASV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. For these reasons, we generally prefer ASV to BPAP with a backup rate when available and affordable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18678881\"><span class=\"h3\">Adaptive servo-ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small clinical trials have consistently shown that the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is also lowered by ASV in patients with treatment-emergent CSA, with the AHI typically improving to &lt;10 events per hour both acutely and after several months of therapy in a large majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/9,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,29-32</a>]. Our confidence in this evidence is limited, however, because it consists of small trials that measured primarily physiological outcomes rather than patient-important outcomes. In addition, most trials were funded by the makers of the positive airway pressure device being studied. ASV devices may be considerably more expensive than CPAP devices.</p><p>Compared with CPAP, ASV may be more effective at reducing the AHI, but the clinical relevance of this advantage is not yet clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/27,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,33</a>]. In a multicenter trial, 66 patients with treatment-emergent CSA and a residual central apnea index (CAI) &gt;10 events per hour during the CPAP titration study were randomly assigned to ASV or CPAP therapy for 90 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics between the two groups, although more patients in the CPAP arm were male (91 versus 79 percent) and had heart failure (15 versus 3 percent). Six patients failed to complete the study, and the adherence rate (defined as use of the study device for &ge;4 hours per night and on &ge;70 percent of the nights during the study) in the remaining patients was 60 percent. Results included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After 90 days of therapy, the AHI was lower in patients treated with ASV versus CPAP (4.4 versus 9.9 events per hour, p = 0.002), but the absolute difference of 5.5 events per hour was lower than the prespecified clinically relevant difference of 10 events per hour.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proportion of patients who achieved an AHI &lt;10 events per hour was greater for ASV (90 versus 65 percent).

The magnitude of the inspiratory pressure provided by the device is reciprocal to changes in peak flow, determined over a three- to four-minute moving window (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F84026\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef84026 \">figure 1</a>). Thus, peak flows that are lower than the average peak flow induce an increase in the amount of inspiratory pressure; conversely, peak flows that are higher than the average peak flow induce a decrease in the amount of inspiratory pressure. The backup respiratory rate can be set automatically by the device or manually and is an important aspect of ASV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>Of note, ASV should be avoided in patients with CSA associated with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.&nbsp;This is based on results of SERVE-HF, a randomized trial of ASV versus standard medical therapy in patients with predominantly CSA due to symptomatic heart failure and a low ejection fraction (EF &le;45 percent) in which ASV was associated with a 6 percent absolute increase in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality compared with standard medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

This observation requires further study and independent confirmation.</p><p/><p>BPAP delivers positive airway pressure at different, but fixed, levels during inspiration and expiration. The level during inspiration is called the inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and the level during expiration is called the expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). BPAP has two major effects. First, it splints the upper airway open. Second, it increases alveolar ventilation by augmenting the tidal volume. The tidal volume is directly related to the difference between the IPAP and EPAP. As an example, the tidal volume is greater when the IPAP is set at 15 cm H2O and the EPAP at 5 cm H2O (difference of 10 cm H2O), than when the IPAP is set at 10 cm H2O and the EPAP at 5 cm H2O (difference of 5 cm H2O).

(See <a href=\"#H18678839\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment-emergent CSA presents as an incidental polysomnographic finding during the initial in-laboratory titration of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy (or bilevel positive airway pressure [BPAP] without a backup respiratory rate) for OSA. Treatment-emergent central apneas occur almost exclusively during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. (See <a href=\"#H9126221\" class=\"local\">'Presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who continue the same positive airway pressure regimen on which the treatment-emergent CSA was detected may remain asymptomatic or manifest symptoms and signs of disrupted sleep due to the central apneas and accompanying arousals. They may also report symptoms related to recurrent oxyhemoglobin desaturation. There are no physical findings that are specific for treatment-emergent CSA, but most patients have physical features that are typical of patients with OSA. (See <a href=\"#H16270696\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic criteria for treatment-emergent CSA include the following (see <a href=\"#H4855760\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients must have confirmed OSA, defined as predominantly obstructive respiratory events occurring at a frequency of &ge;5 events per hour of sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Upon exposure to positive airway pressure without a backup respiratory rate, all of the following must be present: significant resolution of obstructive events; central hypopnea index &ge;5 events per hour; central apneas and hypopneas make up &ge;50 percent of the total number of apneas and hypopneas; and symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness or disrupted sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive airway pressure therapy should be continued if a patient develops treatment-emergent CSA, because there is extensive evidence that treatment of OSA improves clinical outcomes. In addition, approximately two-thirds of patients will spontaneously improve after several months of CPAP therapy. (See <a href=\"#H16270712\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with treatment-emergent CSA, we suggest continuing CPAP as initial therapy rather than switching to an alternative mode of ventilation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients should undergo repeat polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) while wearing their device in two to three months to determine whether central apneas have resolved. (See <a href=\"#H13424170\" class=\"local\">'Expectant management with CPAP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with persistent central apneas on CPAP, we suggest switching to adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In situations in which ASV is not available or too expensive, BPAP with a backup rate is a reasonable alternative. If neither mode is available, continuing CPAP is preferable to discontinuing therapy altogether. (See <a href=\"#H1043268267\" class=\"local\">'Alternative modes of ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ASV should be avoided in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, based on concerns that it may increase cardiovascular mortality when used to treat CSA in this patient population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-treatment#H615716600\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Patients with ejection fraction &le;45 percent'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BPAP without a backup rate may be harmful in patients with treatment-emergent CSA.
