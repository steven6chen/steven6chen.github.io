As a diagnostic category, CVD includes four major areas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary heart disease (CHD), manifested by myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris, heart failure, and coronary death</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrovascular disease, manifested by stroke and transient ischemic attack</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral artery disease, manifested by intermittent claudication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic atherosclerosis and thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysm</p><p/><p>CHD accounts for approximately one-third to one-half of the total cases of CVD. The lifetime risk of CHD was illustrated in the Framingham Heart Study of 7733 participants, ages 40 to 94, who were initially free of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-possible-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The lifetime risk for individuals at age 40 was 49 percent in men and 32 percent in women. Even those who were free from CHD at age 70 had a non-trivial lifetime risk of developing CHD (35 and 24 percent in men and women, respectively).</p><p>Death rates from CVD, CHD, and stroke have declined in the United States since 1975, and evidence from 2000 to 2008 shows a decline in CHD mortality across all major <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83599\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83599 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83597 \">figure 2</a>). CVD and its related complications remain highly prevalent and expensive to treat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-possible-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. CVD is the leading cause of death in most developed countries, with approximately one million Americans dying annually from CVD. The prevalence of CVD is rapidly increasing in developing countries as well.</p><p>Many risk factors for CVD are modifiable by specific preventive measures. In the worldwide INTERHEART study of patients from 52 countries, nine potentially modifiable factors accounted for over 90 percent of the population-attributable risk of a first MI: smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, lack of daily consumption of fruits and vegetables, regular alcohol consumption, and lack of regular physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-possible-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Most patients with CVD have at least one established or borderline risk factor other than age and gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-possible-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. However, it is clear that there are other risk factors, not all treatable, that may be important. The additive value of screening for these risk factors has not been firmly established, and there is only limited evidence that targeted therapeutic intervention will reduce the risk associated with these factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-possible-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>An overview of the possible emerging CVD risk factors is presented here. An overview of the established risk factors for CVD, data supporting the importance of the individual risk factors (eg, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking), coronary risk factors of particular importance in women and in young patients, and estimation of coronary risk in an individual patient are discussed elsewhere.
