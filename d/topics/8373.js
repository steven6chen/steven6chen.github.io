It is caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene on chromosome 4p and inherited in an autosomal-dominant pattern. The pathophysiology of HD is not fully understood, although it is thought to be related to toxicity of the mutant huntingtin protein. As there is no known cure, treatment is symptomatic and remains supportive.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features and diagnosis of HD. Other aspects of HD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY/GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetics and pathogenesis of HD are reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an expansion of the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide in the huntingtin (HTT) gene (also known as the HD gene) that encodes the protein huntingtin, resulting in an expanded polyglutamine tract. Huntingtin is present in a large number of tissues throughout the body. However, pathology mainly involves the central nervous system, with atrophy of the caudate and putamen (the neostriatum) being most prominent. At the cellular level, protein aggregates are seen both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The pathophysiology of neuron loss is incompletely understood. The huntingtin protein is thought to become toxic with the CAG expansion (&quot;gain of function&quot;) but continues to serve a function that is critical to survival in early development.</p><p>The main determinant of age of onset is the number of CAG repeats in the HTT gene. The normal number of repeats is 28 or less. Repeats between 28 and 35 will not develop symptoms but the next generation is at a small risk to develop expansion which may or may not be into the disease-causing range. Repeats between 36 and 39 are incompletely penetrant &ndash; individuals may develop symptoms but typically with a late age of onset. When repeats are equal or greater than 40, the disease is fully penetrant and symptoms of the disease will occur. Those individuals with the earliest onset tend to have the largest expansion in the number of repeats, while onset late in life correlates with a lower expansion of the repeat number. Rate of disease progression is also inversely related to repeat size. Additional factors predicting age of onset are thought to be environmental <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other genetic determinants.</p><p>As with all trinucleotide disorders, there is genetic instability. Expansion of the repeat number between successive generations, which causes an earlier and more severe phenotype, is termed anticipation. Paternal inheritance results in the largest increase. Thus, children with juvenile onset HD will have typically inherited the pathological allele with expansion from the father. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Anticipation and transmitting parent effect'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 2012 meta-analysis that evaluated HD epidemiology studies published since 1985 made the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The worldwide <strong>prevalence</strong> of HD was 2.7 per 100,000</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In studies from Europe, North America and Australia, the prevalence of HD was 5.7 per 100,000</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In studies from Asia, the prevalence of HD was 0.4 per 100,000</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The worldwide <strong>incidence</strong> of HD was 0.38 per 100,000 per year</p><p/><p>The differences in prevalence among ethnic populations are reflected in the size of the normal allele in the population (ie, in Europeans, the normal cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat size is higher than that found in Asians) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Age of onset ranges from childhood to the eighth decade, but is most common in mid-life. Diagnosis before 20 years of age is considered juvenile HD, or the Westphal variant of HD, and comprises less than 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bradykinetic movement disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Juvenile onset Huntington disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically, HD is characterized by chorea, psychiatric illness, and dementia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57709\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57709 \">table 1</a>). Symptoms begin insidiously with movement abnormalities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with psychiatric and cognitive features. The course is one of slow but relentless deterioration in cognitive and motor function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chorea is a key feature of HD, and the defining symptom at the time of diagnosis. Chorea is a rapid, involuntary, nonrepetitive or arrhythmic movement involving the face, trunk, and limbs. Initially, the movements are mild and may be misinterpreted as restlessness. Patients may be unaware of the movements and incorporate the chorea into purposeful actions, a phenomenon termed parakinesia. In a longitudinal study of HD mutation carriers, nearly one-half of patients with onset of unequivocal motor signs of HD were unaware of motor symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Hypotonia with hyperreflexia is a feature of early disease. Dystonia (prolonged, sustained, abnormal postures) may be seen in the hands with such activities as walking. Mild bradykinesia is also observed.</p><p>Progressive loss of voluntary motor control is a characteristic feature of HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Gradually, the chorea becomes more florid and widespread, interfering with movement. In later stages, chorea also affects the diaphragm, pharynx, and larynx, producing dysarthria, dysphagia, and involuntary vocalizations.</p><p>Motor impersistence (the inability to sustain certain simple voluntary acts) is another common manifestation of HD. As an example, patients may have difficulty with sustained tongue protrusion.</p><p>With disease progression, motor function slowly deteriorates, and chorea may eventually be replaced by a parkinsonian akinetic-rigid state in the advanced stages. Walking becomes unsafe when chorea and parkinsonism prevent adequate compensation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Eye movements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal eye movements can be a prominent finding in HD, particularly in younger adult patients. In patients with early HD, there is delay in the initiation of volitional saccades (quick conjugate eye movements between points of fixation), and saccade velocity is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. This is characterized by the absence of saccadic movement with preservation of smooth pursuit. Optokinetic nystagmus is abnormal in very early stages. In more advanced stages of HD, smooth pursuit, voluntary saccades, and refixation are all impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with HD may present with irritability, depression, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disrupted social relationships up to several years prior to onset of chorea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Depression, paranoia, delusions, and hallucinations can develop at any point in the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. HD is associated with an increased risk of suicide for diagnosed patients and at-risk family members. The suicide rate of affected individuals is 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], while rates of suicidal ideation among HD mutation carriers are as high as 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of depressed mood, irritability, apathy, and anxiety ranges from 33 to 76 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Less frequent symptoms include obsessive-compulsive behavior (10 to 52 percent) and psychosis (3 to 11 percent). Psychiatric symptoms do not correlate with duration of disease, repeat length, or presence of dementia or motor symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive impairment and dementia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive decline is inevitable in HD. Rarely, patients with onset of HD late in life may have motor symptoms only, presumably because the remaining life span is too short for cognitive symptoms to become obvious.</p><p>The dominant cognitive feature of HD is executive dysfunction with diminished ability to make decisions, multi-task, and switch from one set of cognitive goals to another. Patients typically lack insight into their cognitive deficits, and may be unaware of their perceptual, motor, and psychiatric problems related to HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The dementia of HD, like other non-Alzheimer dementias, has been described in the older literature as subcortical, referring to clinical models of cognition that highlight frontostriatal pathways as facilitators of speed and efficiency of thought.</p><p>On formal testing, patients with HD find time-based tasks particularly difficult; examples include word fluency, picture sequencing, and the Wisconsin card sorting test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. When compared with patients who have Alzheimer disease, a type of cortical dementia, patients with HD display greater improvement with cuing during recall tasks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This implies that the difficulty in HD is due to an inefficient search of memory. Despite evidence of cognitive abnormalities early in HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], memory loss is usually a late finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Difficulties with other typically cortical functions, such as aphasia and apraxia, are uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight loss and cachexia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight loss and cachexia are common features of HD, despite efforts to maintain appropriate caloric intake.</p><p>The pathophysiology of weight loss is not well-understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Possible contributors include energy expenditure due to hyperkinetic movements and altered cellular metabolism in muscle or adipose tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Some evidence suggests that weight loss correlates with a higher cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat number in mutant huntingtin (HTT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, adult-onset cases present with either cerebellar-type limb and gait ataxia, myoclonus, seizures, or generalized dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. These presentations tend to occur in patients with a younger age of onset (ie, late adolescence or early adulthood). Older adult patients can sometimes present with signs of parkinsonism without tremor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Juvenile Huntington disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When HD presents before age 20, clinical features include myoclonus, seizures, behavioral problems, and parkinsonism. Chorea is notably absent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61297\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61297 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bradykinetic movement disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Juvenile onset Huntington disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Prediagnosis manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following observations suggest that mutant HTT causes subtle manifestations long before the overt symptoms of HD are recognized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using quantitative neuropsychologic tests, neurologic examination, and brain imaging, small but statistically significant differences have been reported between asymptomatic HD cases and controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-46</a>]. Abnormalities have been found in psychomotor speed, negative emotion recognition, irritability, optokinetic nystagmus, motor performance (eg, rapid alternating hand movements, timing of finger taps), and whole brain volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from studies employing MRI and positron-emission tomography (PET) have shown striatal atrophy and hypometabolism predating any clinical features by up to 20 years in asymptomatic patients with HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. These structural and metabolic changes may explain the early symptoms of HD, and could serve as a biomarker to identify presymptomatic patients who may benefit from therapeutic intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case-control study found that asymptomatic children who were at risk for HD due to CAG repeat expansion length &ge;39 in the HTT gene had small but statistically significant reductions in mean head circumference, body mass index, weight and height compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p>Despite these findings, surveys based on analysis of friends and families of patients with HD indicate that the motor disorder is their first indication of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Defining the first symptoms or signs of HD has been the focus of a number of studies of at-risk and asymptomatic patients with HD. Understanding this stage of the illness may allow future therapeutic trials of neuroprotection to focus on delaying clinical onset in those shown to have the huntingtin mutation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Axial MRI images through the lateral ventricles demonstrate caudate atrophy, defined by the loss of the normal protrusion of the caudate head into the lateral ventricle in late-stage HD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66811\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66811 \">image 1</a>). Caudate atrophy, quantified by simple analysis of linear caudate measurements, correlates with change in cognitive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Functional imaging using positron-emission tomography (PET) and MRI also show abnormal metabolic changes in the caudate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,51,52</a>].</p><p>Using computational MRI methods, progressive regional thinning of the cerebral cortex has been reported in patients with both preclinical and symptomatic HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]. These cortical changes may underlie some of the clinical heterogeneity of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H162443376\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PROGRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of age of onset, HD is a chronic, slowly progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The average length of survival after clinical onset ranges from 10 to 20 years, and some affected individuals live for 30 to 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Although progression occurs gradually along a continuum, HD can be divided into individual stages that encapsulate the expected clinical course.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199814039\"><span class=\"h2\">Early stage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients in the early stage of HD are generally functional and independent with most activities of daily living, often remaining independent and able to work and drive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, symptoms of HD are present, such as slight involuntary movements, mild incoordination, difficulty with complex mental tasks, and some degree of irritability, disinhibition, or depression. Slowed voluntary eye movements can be seen, particularly in younger individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1086419511\"><span class=\"h2\">Middle stage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients in middle stage of HD begin to lose the ability to work, drive, or manage their own affairs without assistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In most cases, they will require some assistance with eating, dressing, and personal care. Cognitive decline worsens with diminished ability to solve problems. There is usually increased chorea and difficulty with voluntary motor movements. Impairments in walking and balance may lead to falls. Other problems may include swallowing dysfunction and weight loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H832028188\"><span class=\"h2\">Late stage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The slow but relentless deterioration in cognitive and motor function causes significant morbidity and early mortality. Patients in the late stage of HD require round-the-clock supervision and care in all activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. The loss of voluntary motor control worsens; the few remaining voluntary movements are often ballistic and high-amplitude, which may cause injury due to falls or limb trauma. Most become bedridden. Dysphagia may require placement of a feeding tube to maintain adequate nutrition. Although often nonverbal, patients in the late stage of HD may retain some comprehension.</p><p>While sharing the need for 24-hour care, patients with late stage HD can differ dramatically in disease expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. As examples, some have prominent, severe behavioral disturbances, some have severe chorea and gait disturbance without significant behavioral involvement, and others have severe unawareness of symptoms.</p><p>The advance stage of HD can last for a decade or longer, depending on the level of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Complications of immobility, such as aspiration pneumonia and other infections, result in death 10 to 40 years after disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of HD is based upon presence of the typical clinical features, a family history of the disease (if known), and genetic confirmation of the expansion. Genetic testing for HD involves targeted mutation analysis for pathogenic expansion of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. With the availability of genetic molecular testing, all suspected HD cases can be easily confirmed. Molecular testing can also help avoid unnecessary investigations.</p><p>In the era of molecular testing, neuroimaging is no longer used in confirming the diagnosis of HD. Nevertheless, neuroimaging studies are generally used to rule out other structural disorders. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A family history of genetically proven HD is a key factor in the diagnosis. Siblings or children of an index case who present with symptoms typical of HD can be confidently diagnosed based on a detailed history and physical exam. A careful review of the family history may reveal misdiagnosed parents or grandparents with psychiatric illness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suicide.</p><p>There is no apparent family history in up to 8 percent of patients with genetically proven HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. This finding may be due to misdiagnosis in a family member, death of the affected parent prior to onset or recognition of symptoms, or unknown family history due to adoption. Occasionally, there is no family history of HD because the disease is caused by a new HTT gene expansion in the affected individual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient with clinical features that raise suspicion for the disorder, the diagnosis of HD is confirmed by targeted mutation analysis finding of a cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide expansion of &ge;36 repeats in the HTT gene. Genetic testing is sensitive (98.8 percent) and specific (100 percent) for HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. It allows for easy confirmation of clinical diagnosis and diagnosis of atypical patients.</p><p>For those without a family history, genetic confirmation of HD has significant consequences for other at-risk family members. Decisions of family planning or implications to children of the index case also need special management. Everyone should have genetic counseling before the decision is made to go forward with testing.</p><p>While any treating clinician can appropriately request molecular confirmation of a clinical diagnosis, predictive testing (ie, testing at-risk asymptomatic individuals to see whether they carry the gene) should only be done in a specialized setting, such as a genetics clinic, with detailed counselling and a multidisciplinary team consisting of neurologists, psychiatrists, and genetic counselors. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Predictive (presymptomatic) genetic screening'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1094825975\"><span class=\"h3\">Who should be tested?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic genetic testing for HD is indicated for symptomatic adult patients with unequivocal motor signs of HD, with or without a family history of HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Diagnostic genetic testing may also be indicated for children with a positive family history of HD who develop features consistent with juvenile-onset HD (eg, children with two or more of the following: declining school performance, seizures, oral motor dysfunction, rigidity, and gait disturbance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. To avoid erroneous assignment of symptoms to HD and premature genetic testing, some experts recommend that a neurologist evaluate the child twice at intervals 6 to 12 months apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. If the neurologic evaluations confirm persistent or progressive symptoms attributable to HD, genetic testing for HD would be appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bradykinetic movement disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Juvenile onset Huntington disease'</a>.)</p><p>Predictive genetic testing is an option for individuals who are at risk for developing HD, a category which includes asymptomatic individuals with a positive family history of HD, and patients with a positive family history who have prodromal symptoms (eg, irritability, anxiety, depression, or cognitive impairment) that suggest the impending onset of symptomatic HD. Pretest genetic counseling is recommended before pursuing predictive genetic testing.

In such cases, several genetically heterogeneous disorders that are phenotypically similar to HD (ie, HD phenocopy syndromes) should be considered, such as neurodegenerative disease caused by repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington disease-like syndrome 2 (HDL2), spinocerebellar ataxia type 17, familial prion disease, and Friedreich ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. C9orf72 appears to be the most frequent cause of HD phenocopy syndromes. These disorders are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Hereditary disorders and HD phenocopy syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p>Therefore, in a patient with suspected HD (eg, presenting with chorea or dementia, with or without a family history) where the HTT gene test is negative, genetic testing for repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene should be obtained as the next step, followed by testing for spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F94117\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94117 \">algorithm 1</a>). Evaluation for additional causes of HD mimics should be directed by individual clinical characteristics.</p><p>The yield of further genetic screening in such patients is low. This point is illustrated by the findings from a case series of 285 patients with clinical syndromes consistent with HD who were negative for the CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Additional screening for mutations associated with hereditary disorders that phenotypically resemble HD confirmed a genetic diagnosis in eight patients (3 percent), including seven with one of the Huntington disease-like syndromes and one with Friedreich ataxia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Predictive (presymptomatic) genetic screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our clinical experience, approximately 15 percent of asymptomatic individuals with a family history of HD wish to undergo testing to determine whether they carry the disease-causing HTT repeat expansion. Common reasons for requesting testing include making decisions for child bearing, career and educational choices, or retirement planning.</p><p>Presymptomatic testing should only be performed by specialists at a multidisciplinary clinic where pre-test guidance, test interpretation, and post-test psychological support can be provided regardless of test outcome. Patients should be informed that genetic testing does not allow one to determine the age of onset or other clinical factors because of the variability inherent in HTT gene expression. In addition, it should be noted that predictive genetic testing is associated with a risk of adverse psychosocial effects related to the patient&rsquo;s mood, self-perception, family and social relationships, and insurability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>The combined risk of suicide, attempted suicide, and psychiatric hospitalization after predictive testing for HD is approximately 1 percent with appropriate support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The risk is highest for those who are unemployed or have a prior psychiatric history. Persons who test negative for HD are also at an increased risk of depression.</p><p>In patients who carry the disease-causing CAG expansion in the HTT gene, prenatal testing is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], although rarely used. Prenatal testing is only done in situations where the mother would consider termination of the pregnancy should the fetus test positive. Otherwise, prenatal testing is the same as testing an asymptomatic child, which is not recommended.</p><p>Despite increased understanding of the causes of age of onset, we do not recommend the use of family history or determination of CAG repeat length to make clinical predictions for individual patients, as these indicators are not sufficiently accurate for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], particularly at the lower repeat sizes. This point is illustrated by finding that the time of disease onset for one pair of monozygotic twins differed by more than seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of HD begin insidiously with movement abnormalities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with psychiatric and cognitive features. Chorea is a key feature of HD, and the defining sign at the time of diagnosis. Psychiatric problems can include irritability, depression, dysphoria, agitation, apathy, anxiety, paranoia, delusions, and hallucinations. The dementia of HD is characterized by executive dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With disease progression, motor function slowly deteriorates. Chorea may eventually be replaced in advanced stages of HD by a parkinsonian akinetic-rigid state. The slow but relentless deterioration in cognitive and motor function causes significant morbidity and early mortality.

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HD is based upon presence of the typical clinical features, a family history of the disease, and confirmatory genetic testing for the disease-causing trinucleotide (cytosine-adenine-guanine [CAG]) repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. However, there is no apparent family history in up to 8 percent of patients with genetically proven HD. Approximately one percent of patients with a typical HD phenotype test negative for the HTT gene repeat expansion. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic genetic testing for HD is indicated for symptomatic adult patients with unequivocal motor signs of HD, and may be appropriate for children with a positive family history of HD and persistent or progressive features consistent with juvenile HD. Predictive genetic testing is an option for individuals who are at risk for developing HD, a category which includes asymptomatic individuals with a positive family history of HD.
