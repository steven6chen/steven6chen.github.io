Other names for benign prostatic hyperplasia include benign prostatic hypertrophy, an enlarged prostate, and BPH. BPH occurs only in men; approximately 8 percent of men aged 31 to 40 have BPH. In men over age 80, more than 80 percent have BPH.</p><p>Many men with BPH have no symptoms. In men with symptoms, the most common include needing to urinate frequently (during the day and night), a weak urine stream, and leaking or dribbling of urine. These symptoms are called lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). For men with bothersome symptoms, treatment with one or more medicines or surgery is available.</p><p>More detailed information about BPH is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-treatment-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transurethral procedures for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THE PROSTATE GLAND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prostate is a small gland that is part of the male reproductive system. It sits just below the bladder and in front of the rectum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65675 \">figure 1</a>). The prostate is normally about the size of a walnut.</p><p>The prostate is composed of two lobes, covered by an outer layer of tissue. The prostate surrounds the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder through the penis and outside the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BPH CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not clear why some men develop symptoms of BPH or lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and others do not. The prostate normally enlarges to some degree in all men with advancing age, although not all men require treatment. Several hormones are required for BPH to develop, but these hormones alone do not cause the condition.</p><p>Some experts believe that a family history of the condition increases a man's risk of developing BPH. Frequency of sex and having a vasectomy do not increase a man's chances of developing BPH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">BPH SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of BPH usually begin after age 50. The most common symptoms of BPH include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent urination, especially at night</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hesitant, interrupted, or weak stream of urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need to urinate frequently</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leaking or dribbling of urine</p><p/><p>These symptoms tend to appear over time and may gradually worsen over the years. However, some men have an enlarged prostate that causes few or no symptoms, while other men have symptoms of BPH that later improve or stay the same. Some men are not bothered by their symptoms, while others are bothered a great deal.</p><p>In a small percentage of men, untreated BPH can cause urinary retention, meaning that the man is unable to empty the bladder. The risk of urinary retention increases with age and as symptoms worsen.</p><p>Symptoms of BPH also can be caused by other conditions, including prostate or bladder cancer, kidney stones, and overactive bladder. Overactive bladder causes a strong, frequent, uncomfortable need to urinate immediately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">BPH DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To know if BPH or another problem is causing your symptoms, a doctor or nurse will ask you questions, perform an exam, and do blood and urine tests. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectal exam &ndash; Your doctor or nurse will need to perform a rectal examination to feel the size and shape of the prostate gland. A rectal exam can help to determine if there are signs of prostate cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80412\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80412 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis &ndash; You might be asked for a urine sample to see if you have a bladder infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; A blood test to check the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is recommended. PSA is a protein produced by prostate cells; the PSA level may be increased in men with BPH. Men who have prostate cancer often have a highly disproportionately elevated PSA level, although prostate cancer is also found in men who do not have an elevated PSA.</p><p/><p>Having BPH does not increase your risk for prostate cancer. However, it is possible to have both BPH and prostate cancer at the same time. If your PSA test is higher than normal, you will need further testing to be sure that you do not have prostate cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Prostate cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Urodynamic study</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bladder test, known as a urodynamic study, might be recommended for some men who have signs or symptoms of BPH. This test can give information about how well the bladder and urethra are working.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">BPH TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments for BPH can help to reduce urinary symptoms. Treatment options include medicines and surgery.</p><p>Men with mild BPH might not need treatment. In this case, most experts recommend a &quot;wait and watch&quot; approach. This means that you will watch your symptoms over time. In some cases, BPH symptoms improve without treatment. However, men with moderate to severe symptoms usually require treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two types of medicine used to treat BPH: alpha blockers and alpha-reductase inhibitors. Most men with BPH who start taking a medicine will need to take it forever unless they have some type of prostate surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-treatment-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Alpha blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These medications relax the muscle of the prostate and bladder neck, which allows urine to flow more easily. There are at least five medications in this category: terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), tamsulosin (Flomax), alfuzosin (Uroxatral), and silodosin (Rapaflo). Terazosin and doxazosin were initially developed to treat high blood pressure but were later found to be useful for men with BPH.</p><p>Alpha blockers begin to work quickly and are usually recommended as a first-line treatment for men with mild to moderate symptoms.</p><p>The most important side effects of alpha blockers are dizziness and low blood pressure after sitting or standing up. Terazosin and doxazosin are usually taken at bedtime (to reduce lightheadedness). The dose can be increased over time if needed.</p><p>You should not take terazosin and doxazosin if you take a medicine for erectile dysfunction (ED), such as sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), tadalafil (Cialis), or avanafil (Stendra). Tamsulosin and alfuzosin usually do not interact with ED medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Alpha-reductase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alpha-reductase inhibitors are medicines that can stop the prostate from growing further or even cause it to shrink. Finasteride (Proscar) and dutasteride (Avodart) are alpha-reductase inhibitors.</p><p>This type of medicine works better in men with a larger prostate. It can reduce the risk of urinary retention (not being able to empty the bladder) and the need for surgery. Most men see an improvement within six months of starting treatment.</p><p>A small percentage of men who take alpha-reductase inhibitors have decreased sex drive, difficulty with erection or ejaculation, or symptoms of depression. Sometimes, these problems are significant enough to cause men to interrupt BPH treatment. They resolve when the medication is stopped.</p><p>PSA levels decrease by about 50 percent in men who take finasteride or dutasteride. This is important to remember if you have PSA testing to screen for prostate cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Prostate cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Combination treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A combination of an alpha blocker and an alpha-reductase inhibitor might be recommended for certain men. This may benefit men:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With severe symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a large prostate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Who do not improve with the highest dose of an alpha blocker</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Herbal medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Herbal therapies for BPH, such as saw palmetto, are commonly used in Europe for treatment of BPH. However, the best studies of saw palmetto have shown no benefit in reducing the symptoms of BPH. For this reason, we do not recommend the use of saw palmetto or other herbal medicines to treat BPH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-saw-palmetto\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of saw palmetto&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All men with BPH should avoid medicines that can worsen symptoms or cause urinary retention. These include certain antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine [Benadryl]) and decongestants (eg, pseudoephedrine [found in some cold medicines]).</p><p>Lifestyle changes are also recommended if you are bothered by having to go to the bathroom frequently. This includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop drinking fluids a few hours before bedtime or going out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid or drink less fluids that can make you go more often, like caffeine and alcohol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double void. This means that after you empty your bladder, you wait a moment and try to go again. Do not strain or push to empty.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Transurethral procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If medicines do not relieve your symptoms of BPH, a treatment to remove or destroy some of the prostate tissue around the urethra may be recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58306\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58306 \">figure 3</a>). Most procedures are performed through the urethra using a special scope. Each treatment has advantages and disadvantages, and the best treatment depends upon the size and location of the excess prostate tissue, your surgeon's expertise, and your preferences. Your doctor can help you choose the best course of treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transurethral procedures for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resection of the prostate &ndash; Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has been used extensively in the past and remains a common transurethral procedure for BPH. The urologist inserts special instruments through the urethra to remove pieces of the enlarged prostate. The procedure is done while you are asleep and takes 60 to 90 minutes. Most men stay in the hospital overnight after TURP. Complications can include bleeding, sexual dysfunction (most commonly problems with ejaculation), and problems with urination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ablation of the prostate &ndash; These procedures ablate (destroy) the prostate tissue using electrical, light, or heat energy. Compared with TURP, these procedures have less bleeding and may be preferred for men with medical problems, particularly men who must take blood-thinning medications (eg, warfarin).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Plasma vaporization &ndash; Plasma vaporization is similar to standard TURP except that it uses a special probe that destroys the prostate tissue between two electrodes. This procedure is also called the &quot;button procedure.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laser ablation or enucleation &ndash; Light energy in the form of a laser can also be used to ablate or remove prostate tissue. Terms used to describe common laser ablation techniques include photoselective vaporization (PVP) and Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP, also THuLEP; uses Thullium laser).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimally invasive procedures &ndash; Several minimally invasive procedures are designed to treat smaller volumes of prostate enlargement. They can be performed as same-day procedures, usually under local anesthesia, and are less likely to cause sexual dysfunction. However, patients are more likely to develop recurrent symptoms, which may require the procedures to be repeated in the future.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Incision of the prostate &ndash; With transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP), prostate tissue is not removed but the urethra is widened (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65675 \">figure 1</a>). TUIP is sometimes recommended for men who cannot empty their bladder but do not have a very large prostate, especially if they have other medical problems. Another treatment for BPH is sometimes needed a few years after TUIP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Radiofrequency ablation &ndash; Radiofrequency ablation uses heat applied to specific areas of the enlarged prostate to burn them away. It may also be an alternative for men who prefer a procedure that has a lower risk of urine leakage and sexual side effects. However, men treated with this procedure are more likely than men who have a more extensive procedure to need another BPH procedure over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Microwave thermotherapy &ndash; Microwave thermotherapy also uses heat to destroy excess prostate tissue. Thermotherapy does not cure BPH or problems emptying the bladder (urinary retention), but it does improve symptoms of needing to rush to the bathroom frequently, the need to strain, and slow urine flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prostatic lift &ndash; The prostatic lift (eg, Urolift) procedure uses a device that is introduced into the urethra to increase the size of the urethral opening and reduce obstruction to urine flow. Then, one or more small implants are placed to keep the urethra open. The prostatic lift technique may be an option for men who are poor candidates for other procedures. Longer term follow-up will be needed to determine the durability of the results.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Other procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other surgical procedures may be available for men with BPH.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removal of the prostate &ndash; Surgery to remove the prostate (prostatectomy) might be recommended for men who are healthy and have a very large prostate (over 100 g). This procedure can be done as an open simple prostatectomy or by robotic assisted (DaVinci) laparoscopic simple prostatectomy. Recovery is much easier for the patient after the robotic-assisted laparoscopic procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suprapubic catheter &ndash; A catheter placed directly into the bladder might be used as a temporary measure to manage bladder outlet obstruction prior to surgery; or, in some circumstances (uncommon), it may be a permanent option.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=4849\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
