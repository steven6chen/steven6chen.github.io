DES consist of a standard metallic stent, a polymer coating, and an anti-restenotic drug (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> or a derivative of sirolimus or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>) that is mixed within the polymer and is released over a period of weeks to months after implantation to reduce the local proliferative healing response. DES types currently approved for use in the United States are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65603 \">table 1</a>). The sirolimus-eluting stent is no longer manufactured and several stents have been redesigned since their initial approval.</p><p>This topic will present the mechanisms of benefit of DES and discuss a few procedural and safety issues.

In contrast, late lumen loss after stenting is due solely to in-stent neointimal hyperplasia, as the main benefit of stents is to prevent recoil and negative remodeling. Stents retain a larger acute lumen diameter (than balloon angioplasty) that offsets the reduction in lumen diameter from neointimal hyperplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracoronary-stent-restenosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracoronary stent restenosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>The restenosis benefit of drug-eluting stents (DES) compared to bare metal stent (BMS) results from inhibition of in-stent neointimal hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], which is reflected as a lesser degree of late in-stent lumen loss at six to nine months (0.1 to 0.4 versus 0.9 to 1.0 mm with BMS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].

Sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) were first generation devices developed to prevent the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and other cell types seen with restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. Sirolimus is incorporated into investigational stents, including polymer-free and bioabsorbable polymer devices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Paclitaxel</a> interferes with the function of the microtubules responsible for proper chromosome segregation during cell division. It was first used as an antineoplastic agent. Paclitaxel-eluting stents were also first-generation devices developed to prevent the proliferation of smooth muscle and other cell types seen with restenosis. Paclitaxel coronary DES use is rare; however, paclitaxel is used in drug-coated balloons and on peripheral artery stents. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Everolimus</a> is a semi-synthetic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> derivative in which the hydroxyl group at position C40 of sirolimus has been alkylated with a 2-hydroxyethyl group and that was shown in early small studies to be effective at preventing restenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It is slightly more lipophilic than sirolimus, and therefore it is more rapidly absorbed into the arterial wall.

It is an equipotent analogue of sirolimus in vitro and in vivo was specifically developed for delivery from DES.

With regard to their safety, the preponderance of evidence suggests that DES have similar rates of death and myocardial infarction (MI) to BMS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of intracoronary bare metal stents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The relative rates of stent thrombosis, which can manifest in either MI or death, between DES and BMS have been evaluated and the cumulative risk of stent thrombosis is similar. Stent thrombosis develops in approximately 1 percent of patients during the first year after placement, with half of these events occurring in the first 30 days. Very late stent thrombosis (beyond one year) occurs at an annual rate of less than 1 percent with higher rates in routine practice settings versus lower-risk clinical trial populations; this rate was higher with first generation DES compared with BMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] while the risk with second generation DES is similar to or possibly lower than BMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

In a review of the United States Food and Drug Administration database through 2004, there were 262 unique cases that included hypersensitivity symptoms after placement of first generation <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Placement of a drug-eluting stent was thought to be a probable or possible cause in only 10 cases. This report also identified 17 cases not in the database, including four autopsies that were probably or certainly caused by the stent; nine of these patients had symptoms that lasted more than four weeks. Intrastent eosinophilic inflammation, thrombosis, and lack of intimal healing were noted in the autopsied cases. Hypersensitivity reactions to the newer DES, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> or zotarolimus-eluting stents, are suspected to be much less common; however, a case has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>There have been several reported cases of acute interstitial pneumonitis, a type of hypersensitivity reaction, which led to death within 20 days after placement a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> eluting stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. While (paclitaxel) causality cannot be proven with certainty in these three cases, it is plausible given the report of cases in patients who have received the drug to treat cancer. A single case of zotarolimus-eluting stent-induced hypersensitivity pneumonitis has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In a retrospective study of 1197 patients who underwent stenting with DES, CAA were found at follow-up angiography in 15 (1.25 percent); the mean time between placement and CAA diagnosis was 313 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Risk factors for the development of CAA included DES placement during acute myocardial infarction or in an occluded vessel, longer or multiple DES, and residual dissection.

In the RENAL-DES study, 512 coronary lesions in 215 patients with multivessel disease and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> were randomly assigned to treatment with an everolimus-eluting stent (EES; a second generation stent) or a BMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

These concepts are supported by clinical and intravascular ultrasound observations. </p><p>A central principle in the deployment of DES is to cover the entire lesion as well as sites of balloon predilation to cover all areas of balloon barotrauma. Multiple overlapping stents are sometimes required for diffusely diseased segments that cannot be treated adequately with a single stent. On the other hand, overlapping stents and longer total stent length are associated with an increased risk for restenosis.
