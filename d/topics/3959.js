After kidney transplantation, active CMV infection and disease are associated with increased risk of allograft failure and death; thus, CMV prevention strategies are commonly used in such patients. Preventive therapy decreases reactivation in the setting of latent infection in the transplant recipient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acquisition of acute infection in CMV-seronegative recipients of seropositive grafts.

However, the clinical manifestations of CMV are nonspecific and overlap with many infectious and noninfectious illnesses. Thus, among all transplant recipients, laboratory confirmation is required to establish the diagnosis. Occasionally, a biopsy with histopathologic examination of tissue is necessary to diagnose tissue-invasive CMV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-cytomegalovirus-disease-in-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Among transplant recipients, we confirm the diagnosis of CMV infection or disease with nucleic acid testing (NAT). NAT using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of CMV DNA is the diagnostic modality of choice for most transplant clinicians. PCR has broad linear range, low limits of detection, and low risk of contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-cytomegalovirus-disease-in-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. PCR is primarily used to evaluate blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or, among patients who have a funduscopic exam that is compatible with CMV retinitis, ocular or vitreal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-cytomegalovirus-disease-in-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, various clinical specimens can be subjected to PCR.</p><p>Many commercial and laboratory-developed PCRs for CMV are used. Their results are not interchangeable, given differences in sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction, primers, targets, and PCR protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-cytomegalovirus-disease-in-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Efforts to standardize test results across different platforms are underway, enabled by the release of an international reference standard for the quantification of CMV nucleic acid by the World Health Organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-cytomegalovirus-disease-in-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Standardized assay results are reported as international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> whereas nonstandardized assay results are reported as <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span>.

Clinical judgment must be used when evaluating PCR results. In general, viral loads are highest among patients with tissue-invasive CMV disease. In a study using a standardized CMV assay, patients with CMV syndrome had mean baseline viral loads of 9120 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> whereas patients with tissue-invasive CMV disease had mean baseline viral loads of 20,893 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-cytomegalovirus-disease-in-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Other noninvasive tests are less helpful in the diagnosis of CMV infection or disease. Shell vial and plaque assay cultures are occasionally used to detect CMV in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens in transplant centers where validation of molecular assays on respiratory samples has not yet been performed. Shell vial viral culture consists of the detection of viral infection of human fibroblast cells using monoclonal antibodies against immediate-early antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-cytomegalovirus-disease-in-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Traditional viral cultures are rarely used to diagnose CMV. Viral culture has low sensitivity, long turnaround time, and high cost.</p><p>As noted above, histopathologic examination of biopsied tissue may be necessary to diagnose tissue-invasive CMV disease in patients who have localizing signs or symptoms and negative CMV assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-cytomegalovirus-disease-in-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. CMV disease can occasionally be localized to the gastrointestinal tract in a patient who has negative assays for CMV in the blood or other compartments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-cytomegalovirus-disease-in-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Strategies to control virus progression include decreasing immunosuppression, adding antivirals, and a combination of both.</p><p>Many centers add an antiviral agent upon recognition of CMV reactivation (even in asymptomatic patients), especially in high-risk patients, although cut-offs to trigger therapy in this setting are not well defined and likely vary according to methods of PCR testing. Our practice is to stop the antimetabolite immunosuppressant (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>) first, before adding the antiviral drug in patients who are without symptoms of disease or syndrome. We repeat the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) one week after stopping the antimetabolite to assess response and add an antiviral if there is continued evidence of viremia. If the patient continues to have evidence of active viral replication, we start antiviral treatment even in the absence of symptoms. PCR should be checked weekly.</p><p>As mentioned above, there are centers that are more aggressive with antiviral therapy in the setting with active viremia, even without symptoms of disease. Decision points to dictate aggressiveness in this setting should include consideration of the intensity of immunosuppression (especially with cellular-depleting induction immunosuppressive therapies and treatment for rejection) and risks for disease, as dictated by serostatus, with CMV-seronegative (CMV R-) recipients having the highest risk for rapid progression to disease.

We monitor the blood for CMV replication with PCR at weekly intervals for four weeks to ensure that CMV does not reactivate at the lower antimetabolite dose. If CMV infection recurs, we discontinue the antimetabolite indefinitely.

The selection of antiviral treatment is determined by the severity of illness, initial viral load, ability to tolerate oral medication, and the ability to administer intravenous (IV) therapies at home. The selection of antiviral therapy is <strong>not</strong> stratified depending on whether the patient has CMV syndrome or tissue-invasive CMV disease (see <a href=\"#H2546391737\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above).

CMV syndrome is defined as the presence of detectable viral replication in blood accompanied by attributable symptoms and signs (eg, fever, malaise, arthralgias, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) in the absence of tissue-invasive disease. Tissue-invasive CMV disease is defined as the demonstration of CMV in tissue biopsy specimens by histopathology in the presence of clinical symptoms and signs of end-organ disease (eg, enteritis, colitis, hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, meningitis, encephalitis, and retinitis).

Ganciclovir has been shown to be effective among renal transplant patients with severe CMV infections.

Oral valganciclovir has been shown to be as effective as ganciclovir in patients with mild to moderate CMV infection and spares patients from the risks and cost of central venous access. The dose of valganciclovir is 900 mg orally twice daily (adjusted for renal function).

The typical duration of full treatment doses of antiviral therapy is 21 days but can range from 14 to 28 days or longer. Once symptoms and viremia have resolved, we treat all patients with a one- to three-month course of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> at 900 mg once daily (adjusted for renal function) to prevent relapse; this reduced dose of valganciclovir is sometimes referred to as secondary prophylaxis.
