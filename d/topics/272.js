Despite improvements in renal replacement therapy (RRT) during the last several decades, the mortality rate associated with AKI in critically ill patients remains high. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kidney and patient outcomes after acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute RRT is commonly indicated for patients with AKI. Available modalities for acute RRT include peritoneal dialysis, intermittent hemodialysis and variations of intermittent hemodialysis (such as hemofiltration and slow equilibrium dialysis [SLED]), and continuous RRT (CRRT).</p><p>This topic reviews the acute hemodialysis prescription for patients with AKI. The indications for acute dialysis are discussed elsewhere.

The vast majority of dialyzers contain synthetic membranes. We use dialyzers with noncellulose synthetic membranes for acute hemodialysis. Cellulose membranes and, to a lesser degree, substituted cellulose membranes, are relatively bioincompatible, which means that they tend to initiate an inflammatory cascade and activate complement resulting in the generation of the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Synthetic membranes are more biocompatible than the cellulose membranes and may be associated with fewer infectious complications and an increased probability of improved restoration of renal function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure#H3048702934\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis-related factors that may influence recovery of renal function in acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;, section on 'Characteristics of the dialysis membrane'</a>.)</p><p>There are a variety of noncellulose synthetic membranes available including polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polysulfone, polycarbonate, polyamide, and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) membranes. Except for PAN membranes, all are effective and safe. We do not use PAN membranes (which are not available in the United States) for acute intermittent hemodialysis, although this membrane is used in some continuous renal replacement systems. PAN membranes can activate the kallikrein-kinin cascade, leading to the generation of bradykinin, which is a mediator of pulmonary vasoconstriction, and systemic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If patients <strong>are</strong> being dialyzed with a PAN membrane, they should not receive angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Anaphylactoid reactions have been described with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and PAN membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Reactions may be related to increased bradykinin levels. When ACE inhibitors (which are also kinase inhibitors) are used during dialysis with PAN membranes, bradykinin levels are even further elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. By contrast, angiotensin receptor blockers are not kinase inhibitors and have not been associated with anaphylaxis with PAN membranes.</p><p>ACE inhibitor-associated anaphylactoid reactions are far less common with surface-treated <span class=\"nowrap\">PAN/AN69</span> membranes but have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The synthetic membranes listed above are high-flux membranes. High-flux membranes have greater permeability for larger molecules, which may enhance removal of toxins and improve outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, a benefit to high-flux membranes has not been demonstrated by clinical studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure#H3048702934\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis-related factors that may influence recovery of renal function in acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;, section on 'Characteristics of the dialysis membrane'</a>.)</p><p>Low-flux cellulose dialyzers are either conventional (ie, low efficiency) or high efficiency. If conventional-efficiency low-flux cellulose dialyzers are used, the dialysis time may need to be increased beyond that which is commonly recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury in adults: Indications, timing, and dialysis dose&quot;, section on 'Intermittent hemodialysis'</a>.)</p><p>If a high-efficiency cellulose dialyzer is used, the urea clearance is similar to high-flux membranes, providing blood flow is adequate. However, the increased clearance that is provided by the larger surface area is not observed if blood flow is limited. Thus, among patients who have a poorly functioning central venous catheter, high-efficiency membranes provide no additional benefit and should not be used. (See <a href=\"#H4049774965\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis dose'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Blood flow rate'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIALYSATE COMPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dialysate solution composition consists of potassium, sodium, bicarbonate (or other buffer), calcium, magnesium, chloride, and glucose. Unlike chronic hemodialysis (in which the dialysate composition is generally the same for every treatment), the dialysate composition in acute hemodialysis is routinely altered each treatment to correct the metabolic abnormalities that can rapidly develop during acute kidney injury (AKI). This is particularly true when dialysis is initiated specifically for the treatment of potassium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acid-base derangements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Potassium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe hyperkalemia are often treated medically prior to dialysis. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no rigorous outcomes data that inform the selection of dialysate potassium concentration. Recommendations are based upon understanding of the physical principles underlying dialysis, clinical observations, and on the limited studies performed in maintenance dialysis population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p>The typical potassium concentration in the dialysate for acute hemodialysis ranges from 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. The prescribed dialysate potassium concentration is based upon the predialysis serum potassium value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It is important to determine the predialysis serum potassium level at the start of the hemodialysis session. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Pre- and post-hemodialysis laboratory value monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Although there is no general consensus concerning the optimal strategy, the following is our approach to adjusting the dialysate potassium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The serum potassium concentrations noted below are rather arbitrary, and other approaches are likely to be equally effective and safe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435492614\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with serum potassium &lt;4.5 mEq/L</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the predialysis serum potassium level is &lt;4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> we use a dialysate potassium concentration of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This concentration prevents the development of hypokalemia.</p><p>Some clinicians prefer a slightly lower net dialysate potassium concentration if the serum potassium is 4 to 4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. However, we suggest not using a 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> dialysate, since this requires adding potassium to stock dialysate concentrate, which is not precise and introduces the risk of contamination.</p><p>Another approach that safely provides a lower dialysate concentration is to alternate dialysate concentrations of 3 and 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> on an evenly timed basis to achieve an effective total dialysate concentration of 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. This approach requires intense attention to detail.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435492621\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with serum potassium between 4.5 and 5.5 mEq/L</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the predialysis serum potassium level is between 4.5 and 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> we use a dialysate potassium of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p>However, if the patient has an ongoing reason for hyperkalemia (eg, marked rhabdomyolysis), then we may use a lower dialysate potassium of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> to decrease the risk of the patient developing hyperkalemia prior to the next dialysis session. Among such patients, the serum potassium may be low normal following dialysis, however, and we usually do not do this among patients who are at risk for arrhythmias related to potassium removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. For patients at increased risk of arrhythmias, some nephrologists even avoid using a dialysate potassium &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. However, the increased safety of a 3 compared with a 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> potassium dialysate in this situation has not been shown. Patients who have ongoing risks of hyperkalemia and are at risk for arrhythmias may benefit from continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) rather than intermittent hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Telemetry'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435492635\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with serum potassium between 5.5 and 8 mEq/L</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with a predialysis potassium level between 5.5 and 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> we use a 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> dialysate potassium bath. As noted above, some nephrologists do not use a dialysate potassium &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> for patients who are at risk for arrhythmias. Such patients include those with coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> use, hypertension, and advanced age.

However, for such patients, some nephrologists use a 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> potassium dialysate, which is generally effective.</p><p>As noted above, some nephrologists do not use a dialysate potassium &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> for patients at risk for arrhythmia, even with severe hyperkalemia. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Telemetry'</a> below.)</p><p>All patients who are being dialyzed with a dialysate potassium concentration of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> should be monitored on telemetry for arrhythmias, and we check the serum potassium every 30 to 60 minutes during dialysis. Once the serum potassium is between 6 and 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> the dialysate potassium concentration can be changed to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> for the remainder of the hemodialysis session; this is less likely to cause hypokalemia and avoids a large blood-dialysate potassium difference, which may contribute to the risk of arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>We do not use a zero potassium bath, even in severe hyperkalemia, although it is most effective in reducing the serum potassium in a short period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. A zero potassium bath has been associated with an increased risk of hypokalemia and dialysis-induced arrhythmias, although the data are not very good [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2097742398\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficiency of potassium removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of potassium removal by dialysis is affected by multiple variables. Potassium is transferred from serum into the dialysate during dialysis. Serum potassium decreases quickly during the initial one to two hours of the treatment. Later during the dialysis session and afterward, there is flux of potassium from the intracellular space to the serum.</p><p>The amount of potassium removal is equal to the amount removed by ultrafiltration (convection) and the amount removed by diffusion. The rate of diffusion is proportional to the gradient between the serum and dialysate concentrations. The administration of insulin, intravenous (IV) glucose, beta agonists, or bicarbonate either concurrently or prior to hemodialysis all lower the rate of potassium removal during dialysis because they cause intracellular translocation of potassium, which lowers the serum potassium concentration. Such therapies, if used, should be stopped once dialysis is initiated. The approach to hyperkalemia prior to dialysis is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The dialysate glucose concentration may modulate potassium removal since the glucose load enhances insulin secretion, which drives potassium into the cells. In one study, dialysis against a standard dialysate glucose concentration (ie, 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> resulted in less potassium removal compared with glucose-free dialysate solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Thus, in cases of severe hyperkalemia where potassium removal is critical, a lower dialysate glucose concentration may theoretically be used to facilitate potassium removal. However, this is usually not done in practice. (See <a href=\"#H369367948\" class=\"local\">'Glucose'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Telemetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that patients with underlying cardiac disorders who undergo acute hemodialysis be placed on a cardiac rhythm monitor during the dialysis session. Dialysis-induced reductions in the serum potassium can provoke ventricular arrhythmias. The risk is increased by the presence of coronary artery disease, LVH, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> use, hypertension, and advanced age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/13-17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17,21</a>].</p><p>Other measures to reduce the risk of arrhythmias include close monitoring of the serum potassium and avoidance of very low dialysate potassium, as noted above.

Rapid correction of severe chronic hyponatremia can lead to osmotic demyelination (pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis). Uremia may provide some protection against osmotic demyelination. However, there is a case report of osmotic demyelination following dialysis of severely hyponatremic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Definitions of chronicity and the recommended rate of correction are the same as that in the nondialysis general population.

The expected rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration can be estimated from the rate of sodium infusion into the patient (which is the product of the concentration gradient between blood and dialysate and the blood flow rate) divided by total body water. However, hourly measurements of the serum sodium concentration during the course of dialysis are mandatory, and administration of small amounts of 5 percent dextrose in water (D5W) may still be required to assure that correction does not exceed 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> during the dialysis treatment.</p><p>The goal is to correct the hyponatremia over the course of multiple hemodialysis sessions that are performed over a period of several days.</p><p>CRRT may also be used to safely correct hyponatremia.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Our approach is based on our clinical experience, and we stress that there are no published data to support these recommendations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H460768643\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to metabolic acidosis depends on severity.</p><p>For patients with mild or moderate metabolic acidosis (ie, serum bicarbonate 10 to 23 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and an acidemic pH) or with no acid-base disorder, we generally use a standard dialysate bicarbonate concentration of approximately 30 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p>For patients with severe metabolic acidosis (ie, serum bicarbonate &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and a severely acidemic pH), we use a dialysate bicarbonate solution of approximately 35 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. For such patients, an extended duration of hemodialysis may be necessary. The use of this high-dialysate bicarbonate concentration may result in the slower removal of potassium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and may also increase opioid distribution into the central nervous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2542459249\"><span class=\"h3\">Alkalosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of the alkalemia and the process generating the alkalosis are the main determinants of the dialysate bicarbonate concentration. In particular, the clinician should investigate whether there is ongoing generation versus a one-time insult causing the alkalosis. A one-time insult can be resolved with a single hemodialysis treatment, whereas ongoing generation of alkalosis may require frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> long hemodialysis sessions with a lower bicarbonate dialysate.</p><p>Both the blood pH and serum bicarbonate should be determined to appropriately assess the degree of alkalosis.</p><p>If the predialysis serum bicarbonate level is &gt;28 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or respiratory alkalosis is present, we use a bicarbonate concentration 25 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. We do not use a dialysate bicarbonate lower than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p>If this dialysate does not address ongoing alkalosis, we administer 0.9 percent NaCl while removing volume as necessary. The administration of chloride often corrects the alkalosis, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not completely clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1278373252\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients on mechanical ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients who are unable to increase their ventilation, the administered bicarbonate with dialysis may result in higher CO<sub>2</sub> values. The pCO<sub>2</sub> of the dialysate with bicarbonate dialysate can be as high as 100 Torr. If the patient&rsquo;s pulmonary function is intact, hyperventilation provoked by the increased pCO<sub>2</sub> may decrease hypoxia. However, if the patient is on ventilatory support, the ventilator settings may need to be adjusted to correct hypercapnia. In a patient that is not completely dependent on the ventilator, the hypercapnia may serve as a stimulus for improved ventilation and facilitate weaning and extubation.</p><p>In addition, in patients being mechanically ventilated using low-tidal volume ventilation, an increased dialysate bicarbonate concentration may be required to increase the serum bicarbonate concentration to compensate for the respiratory acidosis resulting from &quot;permissive hypercapnia.&quot; In contrast, in patients being mechanically hyperventilated to compensate for metabolic acidosis, the minute ventilation (respiratory rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tidal volume) may need to be reduced to avoid severe alkalemia as the metabolic acidosis is corrected with dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dialysate calcium ranges from 2 to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and is adjusted based on the serum calcium. The plasma ionized calcium should be measured prior to starting dialysis. Since total plasma calcium levels are poorly predictive of the ionized level (which is the clinically active value), the plasma ionized calcium level should be measured prior to hemodialysis in patients with significant hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia. If the ionized calcium cannot be obtained, the measured total plasma calcium level should be corrected based upon the serum albumin level since the total plasma calcium concentration will change in parallel to the albumin concentration; this correction, however, will not account for changes in acid-base status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=relation-between-total-and-ionized-serum-calcium-concentrations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Relation between total and ionized serum calcium concentrations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are limited published literature to inform the selection of dialysate calcium. Most of the literature is in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) setting and concerns the role of calcium in <span class=\"nowrap\">bone/mineral</span> metabolism or in cardiovascular disease. In patients with AKI, or hospitalized ESRD patients in whom acute dialysis is required, immediate cardiac concerns predominate, and the outcomes data derived from outpatients are less pertinent. The major concern in acute hemodialysis is that lower bath calcium concentrations may prolong and increase the variability of the QTc interval, both risk factors for sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Volume status and the desired UF requirement are determined in part by physical examination and hemodynamic indices. In general, no one, specific test or parameter is sufficient in isolation.</p><p>The following two overriding principles should be recognized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to volume overload is different for chronic dialysis patients and for critically ill AKI patients. The target weight of a chronic dialysis patient is usually determined empirically as the weight at which clinical signs of extracellular fluid expansion are absent and below which clinical signs of extracellular depletion arise. In contrast, among critically ill AKI patients, the volume expansion that is frequently observed is often necessary to maintain optimal circulatory and oxygen transport status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relationship between blood volume and hypotension is different in chronic dialysis patients and critically ill AKI patients. Among critically ill AKI patients, the relationship between volume status and hemodynamic stability is unpredictable. As an example, blood volume monitoring, which is a biofeedback system that automatically adjusts UF rate and dialysate sodium content in response to a fall in circulating intravascular volume, reduces the occurrence of intradialytic hypotension in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] but is ineffective for preventing hypotension in critically ill AKI patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. This lack of a predictable relationship between volume status and hemodynamic stability means that UF goals for a given patient should be assessed not only in terms of fluid mass balance or the mandatory removal of obligatory fluid loads, but also in terms of the effect of intervention on the patient's broader clinical condition and hemodynamic status.</p><p/><p>In hemodynamically stable patients, the estimation of target intravascular volume can be made in the usual fashion utilized for chronic dialysis patients. However, in hemodynamically unstable patients, target intravascular volume should be titrated to invasive or noninvasive monitoring (such as bioimpedance analysis, pulse contour analysis [PiCCO], echocardiography, or inferior vena cava diameter measurement), which should guide the UF goals for a given intermittent hemodialysis session.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544528141\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrafiltration-related hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UF during hemodialysis can result in significant intradialytic hypotension.

Increasing the duration of each session decreases the UF rate required to meet UF goals per session.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sodium and UF modeling &ndash;</strong> Sodium modeling is a method by which a higher dialysate sodium concentration is used at the beginning of hemodialysis and progressively decreased throughout the session to avoid abruptly lowering the plasma osmolarity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. UF modeling is an automated method by which the set UF rate is higher early in the hemodialysis procedure and lower later in the procedure or some modification of this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Combination sodium and UF modeling has been studied but has not been conclusively shown to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient#H715661805\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;, section on 'Prevention of recurrent episodes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sodium modeling may decrease hemodynamic instability during acute hemodialysis. This was demonstrated in a randomized, crossover study of 10 AKI patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The study used either a fixed dialysate sodium regimen (140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> and fixed UF rate or a variable sodium dialysate (160 to 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> and variable UF rate (such that half of the fluid was removed during the first third of the treatment and the remaining half over the last two-thirds). Compared with the fixed regimen, sodium and UF modeling was associated with greater hemodynamic stability and fewer interventions involving nursing and volume replacement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Multiple sodium modeling prescriptions are programmed in most hemodialysis machines, though the availability of specific programs may differ in machines used in Europe versus the US. Patients may respond to only one or all available prescriptions. Thus, trials are required to find the best sodium modeling prescription in AKI patients on hemodialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We prefer either of the following two specific strategies:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With one <span class=\"nowrap\">high/low-sodium</span> modeling prescription, a high-dialysate sodium (eg, 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> alternates with a low-dialysate sodium (eg, 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> with each level set for an equal amount of time. The average of the <span class=\"nowrap\">high/low-sodium</span> levels (eg, 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> is the dialysate sodium usually prescribed in hemodynamically stable patients with normal serum sodium levels. During the low-sodium period, the UF rate is minimized or stopped. UF only occurs during the high-sodium period to draw out intracellular water due to the extracellular hypernatremia. This program is widely available in Europe but not in some machines in the US.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Another sodium modeling prescription is to set the initial dialysate sodium at a high level (eg, 150 to 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>. The dialysate sodium level is then decreased in stepwise, exponential, or linear decrements (depending on clinical effect) to a final low level (eg, 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>. To maintain isonatremia, the time-average concentration of dialysate sodium should be the same or marginally lower than the predialysis serum sodium concentration (approximately within 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>. With a linear sodium profile, for example, the duration (and degree) of dialysis spent below the isonatremic concentration must be approximately equal to that spent above it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Anecdotal experience has suggested that, in addition to the above approaches, using a slightly higher sodium of 143 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or so throughout the entire dialysis rather than 137 to 138 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> may be effective in increasing hemodynamic stability. This will raise the plasma sodium concentration, at least temporarily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although sodium modeling may be associated with improved hemodynamic stability acutely, if dialytic support is prolonged, sodium modeling may be associated with a positive sodium balance due to diffusion of sodium from dialysate to blood because of the higher sodium concentration in the dialysate used during sodium modelling. This may lead to difficulty in blood pressure and edema management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cool-temperature dialysis &ndash;</strong> Cool-temperature dialysis may increase hemodynamic stability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">With cool-temperature dialysis, the patient's blood temperature is maintained precisely at a target value by a series of feedback loops controlling thermal transfer to and from the dialysate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

In many cases, however, renal recovery is both slow and sporadic.</p><p>For those AKI patients who are otherwise medically recovered from their acute illness, renal function alone is usually sufficient to guide dialysis requirements.

In this setting, we generally use the serum creatinine, rather than the BUN, because the creatinine is less confounded by the effects of metabolism.</p><p>For patients who are acutely ill, the decision to discontinue dialysis should not be made solely on the presence or degree of renal recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/55,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,58</a>]. The decision should consider the patient&rsquo;s overall condition (including presence of increased catabolism, fluid overload, ongoing hemodynamic instability, and ongoing requirement for nephrotoxic drugs or large volumes of fluid). It should be noted that the recovery of electrolyte homeostasis does not always parallel the recovery of GFR, so electrolyte abnormalities may also determine the need for dialytic support during the AKI recovery phase. As GFR improves, water homeostasis may not have been restored, and an osmotic diuresis may result in polyuria that must be managed.</p><p>Over half of AKI patients will be able to successfully stop dialysis on their first attempt, and others will need reinitiation of treatment, albeit at lower doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/50,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,61,62</a>].

We generally tailor our approach to the individual patient and expected patient response. For those with clinically obvious and rapid renal recovery, abrupt cessation of dialysis is appropriate and well tolerated, as long as adequate monitoring is in place.</p><p>However, for those who are still acutely ill or who have had a very slow or sporadic recovery, we generally wean dialysis by decreasing the frequency of treatments as tolerated, which is usually over several weeks. This approach may also be optimal for those with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) or those with other important comorbidities such as congestive heart failure, where renal recovery might be compromised.</p><p>Patients with high interdialytic weight gains (despite improved GFR) may benefit from a trial of loop diuretic therapy while the dialysis duration or frequency is being decreased.</p><p>The addition of diuretics does not enhance kidney function recovery or improve renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>], but may increase urine output and sodium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>] and allow for a lower dose of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>Two clinical trials and one observational study have shown that the addition of high-dose diuretics in patients with AKI does not improve weaning from renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-hemodialysis-prescription/abstract/62,67,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,67,69</a>].

Acute renal replacement therapy (RRT), including acute intermittent hemodialysis, is commonly indicated for patients with AKI. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The components of the acute dialysis prescription include the choice of hemodialysis membrane, dialysate composition and temperature, blood flow rate, amount and rate of ultrafiltration (UF), choice of anticoagulation, and total dialysis dose. (See <a href=\"#H369366441\" class=\"local\">'Components of the acute hemodialysis prescription'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use biocompatible high-flux membranes for acute hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Hemodialyzer membranes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysate components include potassium, sodium, bicarbonate buffer, calcium, magnesium, chloride, and glucose. The dialysate composition is routinely altered to correct the metabolic abnormalities that can rapidly develop during AKI. Specific parameters are provided. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Dialysate composition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the first dialysis treatment, the blood flow rate depends on the degree of azotemia. If the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> we use a blood flow rate of &le;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> for the first treatment or two (of 2 to 2.5 hours each). Otherwise, we use a dialysis blood flow rate of 400 mL per minute. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Blood flow rate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The UF requirement is determined by physical examination and hemodynamic indices. In hemodynamically unstable patients, target intravascular volume should be titrated to invasive or noninvasive monitoring. In general, no one specific test or parameter is sufficient in isolation. (See <a href=\"#H544528135\" class=\"local\">'Determining goal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>UF may cause intradialytic hypotension. Intradialytic hypotension can be treated by reducing or discontinuing UF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reducing the blood flow rate. Other measures that may reduce intradialytic hypotension and help deliver effective hemodialysis include increasing the frequency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> duration of treatments, sodium and UF modeling, cool-temperature dialysis, and higher dialysate calcium concentration. (See <a href=\"#H544528141\" class=\"local\">'Ultrafiltration-related hypotension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients who survive AKI recover renal function. Dialysis should not be continued for longer than is necessary. For patients who are still acutely ill, the decision to discontinue dialysis should be determined by the degree of recovery of renal function and by the patient&rsquo;s overall condition (including presence of increased catabolism, fluid overload, ongoing hemodynamic instability, and ongoing requirement for nephrotoxic drugs or large volumes of fluid). (See <a href=\"#H650477106\" class=\"local\">'Management during recovery of renal function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1725023\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Mark R Marshall, MD and Phillip Ramos, MD, MSCI, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p><p>We are saddened by the death of Gerald Schulman, MD, FASN, who passed away in August 2016.
