Vitamin B12 is in foods that come from animals, including eggs, meat, poultry, and fish. Vegetarians need to take extra vitamin B12, but they do not have pernicious anemia.</p><p>In pernicious anemia, your stomach does not make an important protein that your body needs to absorb <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a>. The protein is called &quot;intrinsic factor.&quot; This happens when your infection-fighting system (immune system) attacks the intrinsic factor protein or the cells in the stomach that make it. As a result, even if you eat foods containing vitamin B12, your body does not absorb the vitamin.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Vitamin B12</a> is an important vitamin for making blood cells. People with pernicious anemia might have too few red blood cells (called &quot;anemia&quot;), too few white blood cells (which fight infection), or too few platelets (which help the blood to clot).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Vitamin B12</a> is also important for your brain and nerves. People with pernicious anemia can have depression, problems thinking, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, trouble with balance, or weakness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14571507\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of pernicious anemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with mild pernicious anemia might not have any symptoms. But people can get symptoms if the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a> level is low enough.</p><p>Symptoms can be due to anemia, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pale skin or a pale color in the tissue that lines the inside of the eyelids &ndash; You can see this tissue (called &quot;conjunctiva&quot;) by gently pulling down your lower eyelid. The tissue will appear pale instead of its normal, pinkish-red color.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fast heartbeat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache and muscle pains</p><p/><p>Symptoms related to a low white blood count might include getting infections more often than usual.</p><p>Symptoms related to a low platelet count might include bruising or bleeding. </p><p>People with pernicious anemia might also have changes in how their brain and nerves work. That's because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a> is important in helping the brain and nerves work normally. These changes might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with memory and confusion, which can become severe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood problems, such as being cranky or grouchy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tingling or burning feelings on the skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness in the arms or legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble with balance</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14571522\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for pernicious anemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors use different blood tests to check for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a> levels and the immune problem that causes pernicious anemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14571537\"><span class=\"h1\">How is pernicious anemia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pernicious anemia is treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a> supplements. Most people will get an injection (shot) of vitamin B12 every day for 1 week. After that, a typical way to get the shot is once per week for 4 weeks, followed by monthly shots of vitamin B12 for the rest of your life.</p><p>In some cases, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a> can be taken in different forms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pill that you swallow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tablet that you dissolve under your tongue</p><p/><p>These treatments must also be taken for life.</p><p>No matter what form of treatment you use, it is very important to keep taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a>. If you stop, your vitamin B12 level can become low again, and you can develop serious symptoms.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
