Compared with nondiabetics, diabetics are more likely to have CHD, to have multivessel disease when it occurs, and to have episodes of silent ischemia. As a result of these and other factors, diabetics with CHD have a worse outcome and poorer long-term survival compared to nondiabetics with CHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevalence of and risk factors for coronary heart disease in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk and treatment of acute myocardial infarction, both ST elevation (Q wave) and non-ST elevation (non Q-wave), in the diabetic patient will be reviewed here. The use of coronary revascularization in diabetic patients with stable or unstable angina is discussed separately.

Type 2 diabetics without a prior infarction were at the same risk for MI (20 and 19 percent, respectively) and coronary mortality (15 versus 16 percent) as nondiabetics with a prior MI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80251\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80251 \">figure 1</a>). The risk of infarction was greatest in diabetics with a prior MI and lowest in nondiabetics without a prior MI (45 and 4 percent, respectively). These findings were independent of other risk factors such as total cholesterol, hypertension, and smoking.</p><p>Other evidence that diabetes is a CHD equivalent comes from the Heart Protection Study, in which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> therapy reduced the risk of major vascular events in diabetic patients, including those with no known history of MI, and those with a normal baseline serum low density lipoprotein concentration.

This issue is discussed in detail separately, but the following observation provides an illustration of the evidence supporting this association. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevalence of and risk factors for coronary heart disease in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'CHD before diabetes'</a>.)</p><p>A prospective study evaluated 181 patients with an acute MI and no previous diagnosis of diabetes in whom the fasting blood glucose and two-hour blood glucose after a standard load were serially measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Previously undiagnosed diabetes was present in 31 percent at hospital discharge and 25 percent three months later using oral glucose tolerance test criteria; the respective values were 10 and 13 percent when only the fasting blood glucose was used. Based upon the hemoglobin A1C concentration, the metabolic abnormality preceded the infarction and the hyperglycemia could not be attributed to stress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INCREASED CLINICAL SEVERITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) are often more severe than in nondiabetics, particularly in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. As an example, diabetics present in acute pulmonary edema significantly more often than nondiabetics (11 versus 4 percent in TAMI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

This is usually achieved by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic therapy.</p><p>In contrast, immediate reperfusion does not appear to be beneficial in patients with an acute non-ST (non-Q wave) elevation MI (NSTEMI). The lack of benefit in this setting is probably due to the high rate of early (within minutes to hours) spontaneous restoration of blood flow in the infarct-related artery. Coronary arteriography, performed in the acute period following NSTEMI, demonstrates that the infarct-related artery is not occluded in 60 to 85 percent of cases. </p><p>However, because of improved long-term outcomes, almost all patients with a NSTEMI are candidates for early angiography (performed within 4 to 48 hours after presentation) followed by revascularization if appropriate. This topic will not be discussed further here since the presence or absence of diabetes does not influence decision making.

The best data come from a meta-analysis of pooled patient data from 19 randomized trials that enrolled 6315 patients, 14 percent of whom had diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The following statistically significant findings were noted at 30 days:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality was higher in patients with diabetes compared to those without (9.4 versus 5.9 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality was lower after primary PCI than fibrinolysis (unadjusted odds ratio 0.49, 95% CI 0.31-0.79).

The outcomes were significantly better with stenting and the relative benefit was similar in diabetics and nondiabetics (odds ratio 0.56 and 0.52, respectively). However, at six months, the rate of the primary end point (a composite of death, reinfarction, disabling stroke, or ischemia-driven revascularization of the target vessel) was higher in the diabetic patients (eg, 14.1 versus 9.7 percent with stenting).</p><p>One possible contributor to the worse outcomes in diabetics is microvascular disease. This issue was addressed in a report of two substudies from the CADILLAC trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Two markers of tissue perfusion were evaluated: TIMI myocardial perfusion (blush) grade on angiography and ST segment resolution.

Similar findings in diabetics (reduced myocardial blush grade and impaired ST segment resolution after primary PCI) were noted in another report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Thrombolytic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subgroup analysis of some of the large thrombolytic trials has yielded interesting data about the outcomes of diabetic patients with an acute STEMI. First, diabetics appear to derive the same or more benefit from thrombolysis as nondiabetics. This was demonstrated in the ISIS-2 trial in which diabetic patients receiving streptokinase had a greater improvement compared to placebo than nondiabetics (31 versus 23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Second, although diabetic patients benefit from thrombolytic therapy, they have more severe pre-existing disease and have a worse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7,12,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,20,21</a>]. A report from GISSI-2 trial evaluated 11,667 patients, all of whom received thrombolytic therapy; 32 percent of women and 16 percent of men had diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The in-hospital mortality was moderately increased in diabetic men (8.7 and 10.1 percent for type 1 and 2 diabetes, respectively, versus 5.8 percent for nondiabetic patients) and was markedly increased in type 1 diabetic women (24 versus 16 and 14 percent for type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic women, respectively).</p><p>In an analysis from the GUSTO-I trial (over 40,000 patients who received thrombolysis, approximately 15 percent of whom were diabetic), diabetic patients were more likely to be elderly and to have hypertension and heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>]. They also had a higher number of prior infarctions and more coronary artery bypass graft procedures. There were no significant differences between diabetics and nondiabetics in the infarct-related arterial patency rates (TIMI flow grade III) at 90 minutes (40 versus 38 percent), reocclusion rates (9.2 versus 5.3 percent), or left ventricular ejection fraction at 90 minutes or five to seven days. Despite these similarities, the diabetic patients had a significantly higher mortality rate at 30 days (11.3 versus 5.9 percent) and one year (14.5 versus 8.9 percent). After adjustment for clinical and angiographic variables, diabetes remained an independent determinant of short- and long-term mortality.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effect on retinopathy &ndash; The presence of hemorrhagic diabetic retinopathy has been classified in the past as an absolute contraindication for thrombolytic therapy because of the risk for retinal hemorrhage. Among 6011 patients with diabetes in the GUSTO-I trial, it was estimated that about 2000 had nonproliferative retinopathy and about 300 had proliferative retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Only one patient had an ocular hemorrhage, which was an eyelid hematoma. Although the risk of ocular hemorrhage was not as completely evaluated in other major thrombolytic trials, an appreciable number of diabetics were included without reports of major intraocular bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, intraocular hemorrhage from thrombolytic therapy is rare and diabetic retinopathy should <strong>not</strong> be considered a contraindication to thrombolytic therapy in acute MI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiplatelet drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with an acute MI, including those with diabetes, are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> indefinitely and a P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker for a minimum of one year to prevent recurrent MI or death.

However, these concerns have been overstated, and analysis of outcomes of diabetic subgroups in several postinfarction beta blocker trials have shown an overall benefit from the use of beta blockers that is at least equivalent to and may be greater than that seen in nondiabetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].
