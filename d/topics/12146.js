Precipitated opioid withdrawal can occur when a patient who is physiologically dependent upon opioids and who has or recently had opioids in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> system is administered an opioid antagonist (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a>, or nalmefene) or an opioid partial agonist (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a>). Signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal include drug craving, anxiety, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, diaphoresis, and tachycardia. Untreated opioid withdrawal frequently results in relapse to opioid use.</p><p>Patients in opioid withdrawal or seeking to stop an opioid to which they are physiologically dependent can undergo medically supervised opioid withdrawal (also known as detoxification), in which medication is used to reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>This topic describes the clinical manifestations, course, assessment and diagnosis of opioid withdrawal.

However, in those previously tolerant to opioids, briefer periods of relapse may trigger withdrawal after shorter periods of use followed by cessation. Withdrawal will only occur in those who have developed tolerance to the opioid.</p><p>Following cessation of opioid use, the precise onset and completion of withdrawal, the order of symptoms, and which symptoms are most prominent can vary prominently among individuals and across opioid drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. As examples, the duration of the syndrome can range from four to five days for intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> to two to three weeks for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>. A rough rule of thumb is that onset of symptoms occurs after two to three times the half-life of the withdrawn opioid.

Treatment can be provided at several levels of care, including outpatient, intensive outpatient, partial hospital, residential (medically-supervised) programs, or inpatient (medically-managed) services. The best-established system for assisting the clinician in determining the appropriate level of care is the American Society of Addiction Medicine's (ASAM) Treatment Criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In general, higher (or more intensive) levels of care are provided to patients with more severe <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complex conditions, such as those with co-occurring medical disease or mental disorders.

Untreated opioid withdrawal frequently results in relapse to opioid use. (See <a href=\"#H2009707767\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms and signs of unmedicated opioid withdrawal include (see <a href=\"#H3443629360\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gastrointestinal distress &ndash; Abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Flu-like symptoms &ndash; Lacrimation, rhinorrhea, diaphoresis, shivering, piloerection, and goose bumps</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sympathetic nerve and central nervous system arousal &ndash; Mydriasis, mild hypertension and tachycardia, anxiety and irritability, insomnia, agitation, restless leg syndrome, general restlessness, tremor, and, less frequently, low grade temperature and tactile sensitivity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other &ndash; Yawning, sneezing, anorexia, dizziness, <span class=\"nowrap\">myalgias/arthralgias,</span> and leg cramps </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Co-occurring psychiatric disorders that are seen in greater frequency in patients with physiologic dependence on opioids include panic disorder and other anxiety disorders, mood disorders, suicidality, acute and posttraumatic stress disorders, and other substance use disorders. (See <a href=\"#H2686621800\" class=\"local\">'Co-occurring conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following cessation of opioid use, the precise onset and completion of withdrawal, the order of symptoms, and which symptoms are most prominent can vary prominently among individuals and across opioid drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. As examples, the duration of the syndrome can range from four to five days for intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> to two to three weeks for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>. A table describes times to onset and peak withdrawal, and duration of withdrawal for various opioids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F105766\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105766 \">table 2</a>). Unmedicated opioid withdrawal can be quite uncomfortable but rarely life threatening. (See <a href=\"#H2878809650\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An initial evaluation of patients at risk of opioid withdrawal should include a substance use history, psychiatric assessment and history, mental status examination, medical history and physical examination, laboratory testing, level of care determination, and, if physiologic dependence is in doubt, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> challenge test. (See <a href=\"#H1308590390\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For each substance abused, document the amount used, frequency, route, duration, and time of last use. The use of other substances along with opioids can influence the level of care needed and choice of subsequent maintenance medications. Duration of last use influences the likelihood of physiologic dependence and withdrawal symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3249667807\" class=\"local\">'Substance use history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients experiencing opioid withdrawal or seeking to stop an opioid to which they are physiologically dependent can undergo medically supervised opioid withdrawal (also known as detoxification), in which medication is used to reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Supervised withdrawal alone does not generally result in sustained abstinence from opioids, so treatment planning should also include a transition to maintenance treatment when the withdrawal syndrome has subsided.
