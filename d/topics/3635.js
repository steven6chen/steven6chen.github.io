In the last two decades, multiple classification systems have been used for these conditions. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kiel classification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>World Health Organization (WHO) classification 2001 </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>WHO-EORTC classification 2005</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>WHO classification 2008</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Revised WHO classification 2016</p><p/><p>In the early 1980s, mycosis fungoides (MF), S&eacute;zary syndrome (SS), and some related disorders, collectively termed cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), were the only types of cutaneous lymphomas that were recognized. Cutaneous lymphomas other than <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> were firmly believed to represent skin manifestations of a systemic lymphoma and treated accordingly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-primary-cutaneous-lymphomas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The development and application of immunophenotyping and cytogenetic and molecular testing had a major impact on the diagnosis and classification of cutaneous lymphomas. Collaborative studies by dermatologists and pathologists using these new diagnostic techniques demonstrated that malignant lymphomas other than <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> can present primarily in the skin without detectable extracutaneous disease. Based upon these studies, several new types of CTCL and cutaneous B cell lymphomas (CBCL) were defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-primary-cutaneous-lymphomas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It became clear that primary cutaneous lymphomas had distinctive immunophenotypic and genetic features, a different clinical behavior, and often a much better prognosis than histologically similar nodal lymphomas with secondary skin involvement. </p><p>Since in the past primary CTCL and CBCL were not recognized by the classification systems used by hematopathologists for nodal lymphomas (eg, Kiel classification, Working Formulation), they were often inappropriately treated as systemic lymphomas with unnecessarily aggressive therapeutic regimens. This observation prompted the EORTC Cutaneous Lymphoma Group to formulate a separate classification for primary cutaneous lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-primary-cutaneous-lymphomas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The 1997 EORTC classification simply listed the different types of CTCL and CBCL that had been defined as separate entities in the decade before. It included a limited number of well-defined types of CTCL and CBCL and some provisional entities. A distinction was made among cutaneous lymphomas with indolent, intermediate, or aggressive clinical behavior. The clinical significance of this classification has been validated by several large studies including more than 1300 patients with a primary cutaneous lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-primary-cutaneous-lymphomas/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>The third edition of the WHO classification for tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, published in 2001, included most types of CTCL but did not recognize different types of CBCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-primary-cutaneous-lymphomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The combined efforts of the EORTC Cutaneous Lymphoma Group and the WHO group resulted in a new consensus classification for primary cutaneous lymphomas, the 2005 WHO-EORTC classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-primary-cutaneous-lymphomas/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Several large studies have validated the clinical significance of this new classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-primary-cutaneous-lymphomas/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p>The fourth edition of the WHO classification, published in 2008, and its 2016 revision have adopted the terminology and definitions of the WHO-EORTC classification with only minor modifications and now include all types of CTCL and CBCL relevant for dermatologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-primary-cutaneous-lymphomas/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The relative frequency and prognosis of the different types of CTCL and CBCL included in the 2016 revision of the WHO classification are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109862\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109862 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will briefly discuss the types of primary cutaneous T cell and B cell cutaneous lymphomas included in the 2016 revision of the WHO classification of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms.

Approximately 25 percent of ATLL patients present with skin lesions mimicking MF or S&eacute;zary syndrome.

Unlike systemic ALCL, the vast majority of C-ALCL are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative and do not show the t(2;5) chromosomal translocation.

Although these variants do not have therapeutic or prognostic implications, it important that pathologists recognize them and include LyP in the differential diagnosis of certain types of CTCL.

Studies have shown clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypic differences between cases of SPTCL with an alpha-beta T cell phenotype and those with a gamma-delta T cell phenotype, suggesting that they may represent different entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-primary-cutaneous-lymphomas/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. While most SPTCL with an alpha-beta T cell phenotype show an indolent clinical behavior, SPTCL with a gamma-delta T cell phenotype runs a very aggressive clinical course, similar to other types of gamma-delta T cell lymphoma.</p><p>Therefore, in both the 2005 WHO-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classification and the 2016 revised WHO classification, the term SPTCL is only used for cases with an alpha-beta T cell phenotype, whereas cases with a gamma-delta T cell phenotype are included in the category of primary cutaneous gamma-delta T cell lymphoma (PCGD-TCL).

PCFCL generally presents with localized lesions on the head, particularly the scalp, or trunk. PCFCL may show a follicular, a follicular and diffuse, or a diffuse growth pattern. In contrast to nodal follicular lymphomas, most PCFCL with a follicular growth pattern are B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-negative and lack the t(14;18) translocation.
