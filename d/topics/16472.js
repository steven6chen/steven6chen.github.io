In a surgical series of 60 patients with SDH, 25 patients underwent craniotomies, 24 were treated with burr holes, eight had craniotomies with dural grafting, and three had decompressive craniectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a subgroup of severely affected patients with GCS scores of 4 to 6, patients treated with burr holes had a significantly worse outcome (with increased mortality and decreased functional recovery rates) than those treated with craniotomy.</p><p>These results should be interpreted with great caution given methodologic limitations of this study, including small patient numbers, nonrandomized treatment allocation, and differences between treatment groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence from observational studies suggests that surgery within two to four hours after the onset of neurologic deterioration in patients with SDH is associated with a lower mortality than delayed surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/1,2,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,13-15</a>]. These studies reported mortality rates between 30 and 47 percent if surgery was performed within two to four hours of deterioration, generally characterized by a decreasing GCS score or emergence of new focal findings such as pupillary asymmetry or posturing. However, mortality rates were 80 to 90 percent when intervention was delayed beyond two to four hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In contrast, most studies evaluating the time between injury and surgery have reported no significant relationship with outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/5,8,10,11,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,10,11,16,17</a>], and some reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/3,10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,18</a>] found that early intervention appeared to have a worse outcome than delayed surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, these data are probably confounded by selection bias, since patients who had immediate surgery tended to have more severe injuries and lower initial GCS scores than those in whom intervention was delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No randomized trials have compared surgery with conservative management for patients with SDH, but limited observational data suggest that stable patients with acute SDH who have small hematomas can be managed nonoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/6,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19,20</a>]. Hematoma enlargement and neurologic deterioration requiring surgery may occur hours to weeks after injury in such patients. Thus, close observation, intracranial pressure monitoring, and serial brain imaging is an important aspect of nonoperative management.</p><p>Supporting evidence is found in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 23 conscious patients with acute isolated SDH who were initially managed nonoperatively, six patients deteriorated neurologically and required surgical hematoma evacuation at a mean of 15 days after injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Compared with those who did not have surgery, patients requiring surgery had significantly larger hematoma volume (53 versus 32 cm^3). An initial hematoma thickness &gt;10 mm was present in all six patients requiring surgery compared with none in the nonoperative group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 31 patients with traumatic SDH who were initially managed nonoperatively, six experienced neurologic deterioration requiring surgical hematoma evacuation within three days of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a subgroup of patients with a GCS score of &lt;15, midline shift &gt;5 mm on head CT was significantly associated with neurologic worsening, leading to surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series of 65 comatose patients with acute SDH, 15 patients were selected for nonoperative management because they were clinically stable or improved from the time of injury to evaluation, had hematoma thickness &lt;10 mm and midline shift &lt;5 mm on initial head CT, and had no evidence of uncompensated intracranial pressure elevation with invasive monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Two patients in the nonoperative group had delayed surgical evacuation after developing parenchymal hematomas and intracranial pressure elevation. A functional outcome was achieved in 13 of 50 patients (26 percent) initially treated with surgery and in 10 of 15 patients (67 percent) initially managed nonoperatively.</p><p/><p>For patients with traumatic head injury, serial follow-up head CT scans should be obtained during the first 36 hours after injury, as there is a high incidence of clot expansion during this interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Hematoma expansion may be even more likely when the patient presents with diminished consciousness, a low Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score, or with additional intracranial injuries on CT scan such as mass effect, intraventricular hemorrhage, or epidural hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Given these data, we suggest that the first follow-up head CT scan should be obtained within six to eight hours of the initial scan for patients with acute traumatic SDH who are managed nonoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Deciding who needs surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appropriateness and timing of intervention is governed by such factors as the acuity of hemorrhage, initial presentation, neurologic decline, age of the patient, and CT characteristics of the hematoma.

Age may also influence the decision to perform surgery, as advanced age appears to be a poor prognostic indicator in patients with acute SDH. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic indicators'</a> above.)</p><p>Guidelines from an expert panel published in 2006 recommend surgical evacuation for patients with acute SDH who have clot thickness &gt;10 mm or midline shift &gt;5 mm, regardless of the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, surgery is recommended if the GCS score has decreased by &ge;2 points from the time of injury to hospital admission <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the patient presents with asymmetric or fixed and dilated pupils.</p><p>The guidelines recommend nonoperative management in an intensive care unit with intracranial pressure monitoring for patients who present with coma (defined as a GCS score &lt;9), provided they are neurologically stable and have clot thickness &lt;10 mm, midline shift &lt;5 mm, no pupillary abnormalities, and no intracranial hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Surgery is recommend for these patients if the intracranial pressure is consistently &gt;20 mmHg.</p><p>The guidelines further recommend that surgery be performed as soon as possible for patients with indications for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Craniotomy is the recommended surgical technique for patients with acute SDH and coma (defined as GCS score &lt;9).</p><p>Similar to the guidelines, we recommend urgent (within two to four hours) surgical hematoma evacuation for patients with acute SDH and the potential for recovery who are admitted with signs attributable to brain herniation or elevated intracranial pressure, such as asymmetric or fixed and dilated pupils. In addition, we recommend urgent surgical hematoma evacuation for patients with acute SDH, with or without coma, who have evidence of neurologic deterioration since the time of injury, and we suggest urgent surgical hematoma evacuation for patients with clot thickness &ge;10 mm or midline shift &ge;5 mm on initial brain scan.</p><p>We suggest nonoperative management for patients with acute SDH not meeting these criteria. Thus, nonoperative management is appropriate for patients, with or without coma at presentation, who are clinically stable or improving, have no signs of brain herniation, and have clot thickness &lt;10 mm and midline shift &lt;5 mm on initial head CT. Small asymptomatic SDHs can be managed conservatively without surgery, as these usually resolve spontaneously with gradual absorption over weeks.</p><p>Patients with diminished consciousness or coma who are managed nonoperatively should be observed in an intensive care unit with intracranial pressure monitoring and serial head CT scans. For such patients, we recommend urgent surgical evacuation if there is clinical evidence of neurologic deterioration, or if intracranial pressure is persistently &gt;20 mmHg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic SDH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urgent surgical hematoma evacuation is necessary for patients with chronic SDH and the potential for recovery who develop signs attributable to brain herniation or elevated intracranial pressure, such as asymmetric or fixed and dilated pupils.</p><p>There are no expert guidelines for the management of symptomatic chronic SDH. We recommend surgical evacuation of chronic SDH in patients with potential for recovery if there is evidence of moderate to severe cognitive impairment or progressive neurologic deterioration attributable to the chronic SDH. In addition, we suggest surgical evacuation of chronic SDH in patients with clot thickness &ge;10 mm or midline shift &ge;5 mm on brain scan.</p><p>Although data are sparse, some authors advocate conservative management for elderly patients with chronic SDH but no evidence of increased ICP, even when the SDH is thought to be causing or contributing to cognitive impairment. In one small series, five patients older than 70 years with chronic SDH following minor head trauma were observed over approximately one month. These patients were clinically characterized by headache and decreased cognition on the Mini Mental Status Exam at the outset of the study. Serial head CT scans revealed complete disappearance or marked reduction in SDH size by 30 to 45 days, and clinical recovery was complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>For liquefied chronic SDH that fails to resolve spontaneously, one or more burr holes can be placed to allow drainage of the hematoma. A flexible catheter (Jackson-Pratt drain) is usually placed in the subdural space for several days until the drainage subsides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A randomized, controlled trial found that the use of a drain after burr hole placement prevented SDH recurrence (9 versus 24 percent) and reduced 6-month mortality (9 versus 18 percent) without an excess in medical or surgical complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A craniotomy with resection of membranes that surround the clot should be performed to prevent reaccumulation of fluid in cases of chronic SDH that rebleed after burr hole drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p>A subdural evacuating port system is a more recently developed, less invasive alternative to craniectomy and burr hole decompression that appears safe and similarly effective in small observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Reversing anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coexistent anticoagulation in patients with either traumatic or spontaneous SDH is not uncommon and must be reversed before surgical intervention. Ideally, anticoagulation should also be reversed for those patients who are managed nonoperatively. However the potential benefit of reversing anticoagulation (a reduced risk of hematoma enlargement) must be weighed against the risk related to the underlying need for anticoagulation in this group (eg, atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valve). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-warfarin-associated-bleeding-or-supratherapeutic-inr\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of warfarin-associated bleeding or supratherapeutic INR&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Options for reversal of oral anticoagulant therapy include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a>, 3 and 4 factor unactivated prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), factor VIII inhibitor activity bypassing agent (FEIBA), and fresh frozen plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. These agents vary in the onset and duration of their effect, as well as potential complications. They have been better studied for the treatment of anticoagulant-associated intracerebral hemorrhage than for subdural hematoma, but have not been compared to each other in clinical trials for either indication.</p><p>Our approach to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> reversal is similar to that recommended for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage associated with oral anticoagulant therapy.

This is outlined in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-warfarin-associated-bleeding-or-supratherapeutic-inr#H744870\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of warfarin-associated bleeding or supratherapeutic INR&quot;, section on 'Serious/life-threatening bleeding'</a>). The dose of PCC is based on the factor IX content of the preparation; after initial infusion of 500 to 1000 international units at a rate of 100 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/min,</span> subsequent infusion of PCC should be at a rate of &le;25 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/min</span>.</p><p>In addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, several novel oral anticoagulants are now in common use and may be encountered in the setting of subdural hematoma. These include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>, a direct thrombin inhibitor, and the Xa inhibitors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edoxaban</a>. The specific reversal strategy, efficacy of reversal, and monitoring for these agents varies according to their mechanism of action. In cases of significant SDH in which anticoagulant reversal is clinically warranted, 4 factor PCC can be used for Xa inhibitor reversal.

Definitive therapy is usually hematoma evacuation; medical resuscitation techniques include head elevation, hyperventilation, and osmotic diuresis with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> or hypertonic saline. The management of elevated intracranial pressure is reviewed elsewhere.

The use of postoperative drainage is associated with a lower risk of secondary recurrence. Older age, thicker hematoma width, and bilateral presentation have been linked to higher rates of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/40-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-45</a>]. Ongoing antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy also likely increase the risk of recurrent SDH as has been found with SDH risk in general, although this has not been consistently found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-prognosis-and-management/abstract/44,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46,47</a>].</p><p>Whether patients can resume antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy after SDH is a common question. Clinical decision making relies on analysis of risks and benefits in individual patients, and general recommendations cannot be made. Important considerations include the indication for antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. The underlying etiology, severity, and acute versus chronic presentation of SDH also likely impact the risk. As an example, the risk benefit analysis might favor resumption of antiplatelet therapy in a patient with active coronary disease after a SDH related to a traumatic injury that was not likely to recur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1812979090\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Age and neurologic status, as assessed with the Glasgow coma scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854 \">table 1</a>), are important prognostic indicators. Head CT findings that correlate with poor outcome after SDH (in some but not all studies) include hematoma thickness and volume, the presence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> degree of midline brain shift and reduced patency of the basal cisterns. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urgent surgical hematoma evacuation is necessary for patients with acute or chronic SDH and the potential for recovery who are admitted with signs attributable to brain herniation or elevated intracranial pressure, such as asymmetric or fixed and dilated pupils. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with acute SDH, with or without coma, who have evidence of neurologic deterioration since the time of injury and the potential for recovery, we recommend urgent surgical hematoma evacuation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). In addition, we suggest urgent surgical hematoma evacuation rather than nonoperative management for patients with clot thickness &ge;10 mm or midline shift &ge;5 mm on initial brain scan (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest nonoperative management for patients not meeting these criteria (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Thus, nonoperative management is suggested for patients with acute SDH, including those with coma at presentation, who are clinically stable or improving, have no signs of brain herniation, and have clot thickness &lt;10 mm and midline shift &lt;5 mm on initial head CT. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Acute SDH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute SDH and diminished consciousness or coma who are managed nonoperatively should be observed in an intensive care unit with intracranial pressure monitoring and serial head CT scans. We suggest that the first follow-up head CT scan should be obtained within six to eight hours of the initial scan for patients with acute traumatic SDH. If a nonoperatively managed patient develops clinical signs of neurologic deterioration, or if intracranial pressure is persistently &gt;20 mmHg, we recommend urgent surgical evacuation within two to four hours of deterioration (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Nonoperative management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Acute SDH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with chronic SDH and the potential for recovery, we recommend surgical hematoma evacuation if there is evidence of moderate to severe cognitive impairment or progressive neurologic deterioration attributable to the chronic SDH (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). In addition, we suggest surgical hematoma evacuation rather than nonoperative management if there is clot thickness &ge;10 mm or midline shift &ge;5 mm on brain scan (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
