They can have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble thinking clearly, focusing, or remembering</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression, anxiety, or a related condition called post-traumatic stress disorder (often called PTSD)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle weakness, trouble walking, or trouble moving certain body parts</p><p/><p>A form of PICS can also affect the family members of people who have been treated in the ICU. When it affects a family member, the condition is called &quot;PICS-F.&quot; (The &quot;F&quot; stands for &quot;family.&quot;) Among family members, the main symptoms are depression, anxiety, and PTSD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H203246794\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor will probably be able to tell if you have PICS based on your symptoms. Still, there's a chance he or she will want to order tests to make sure something else is not causing your symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H203246807\"><span class=\"h1\">How is PICS treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, treatment involves addressing whichever symptoms are present. Often that means combining a few different treatments.</p><p>If you have muscle weakness or trouble moving, your doctor will likely recommend that you work with a physical therapist. A physical therapist can help you learn exercises and ways to move your body that will help you regain some strength and mobility. If you have depression or anxiety, your doctor might prescribe medicines to relieve the symptoms and suggest that you speak to a counselor. If you have trouble thinking clearly, you might get special memory training to help you improve your focus and follow through with tasks.</p><p>When it comes to PICS, doctors have found that treatments that help with one type of symptom often also help with the other types. For example, people who regain the ability to move by working with a physical therapist often feel less depressed, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H203246820\"><span class=\"h1\">Can PICS be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. If you are being treated in an ICU, try to get out of bed and move around as soon as your doctors say it's OK to do so. Even if you feel weak or sick, it's important to move around as soon as you possibly can.</p><p>If you are taking care of a loved one in the ICU, try to keep a diary of the things that happen each day. Having a diary might help your loved one feel less confused after he or she is released from the ICU. It might also be helpful to try to do normal, everyday things with your loved one &ndash; even if you don't think he or she is aware of you. Speak to, read aloud to, or massage your loved one, and do other things to make him or her comfortable. If you are having a hard time dealing with the illness, see your own doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H203246833\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Getting over PICS can take months to years, but many people do get better. If you have PICS, stick with the treatments your doctor suggests. They take a while to work and you might not get totally back to normal, but many of the symptoms will likely improve.</p><p>If you have PICS-F, know that you are not alone. Many people have a hard time seeing a loved one suffer. Work with a counselor and ask your own doctor for input. Your symptoms might continue even after your loved one is released from the ICU. Make sure you take care of yourself, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H203246846\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-respiratory-distress-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Adult respiratory distress syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=going-home-from-the-hospital-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Going home from the hospital (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-directives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Advance directives (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-traumatic-stress-disorder-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Post-traumatic stress disorder (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
