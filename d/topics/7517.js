Pneumonia is the most common type of infection in lung transplant recipients. Bacterial, viral, fungal, and mycobacterial infections all occur at an increased frequency after lung transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial infections following lung transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cytomegalovirus infection in lung transplant recipients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of non-<em>Candida</em> fungal infections are acquired through inhalation. Pretransplant colonization, particularly with filamentous molds (eg, <em>Aspergillus</em> spp), also increases the risk of posttransplant pulmonary fungal infection. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to the direct morbidity and mortality caused by infectious complications, they may also lead to loss of allograft function and contribute to the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, in a cohort of 201 lung transplant recipients in which 54 (27 percent) were colonized with <em>Aspergillus</em> spp, such colonization was found to be an independent risk factor for BOS on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 1.81, 95% CI 1.03-3.19) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Candidemia usually occurs during the first month following lung transplantation as a result of intensive care unit exposure and recent surgery. Aspergillosis occurs a median of 3.2 months following lung transplantation, with 72 percent of cases occurring within the first six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Non-<em>Aspergillus </em>molds (eg, <em>Scedosporium, Purpureocillium, Scopulariopsis) </em>are frequently isolated from respiratory samples from lung transplant recipients receiving inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-amphotericin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal amphotericin B</a> prophylaxis (pretransplant 11.9 percent, posttransplant 16.9 percent), but only a minority (2.4 percent) developed an invasive fungal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Non-<em>Aspergillus</em> molds may present later than <em>Aspergillus</em> (median 419 days posttransplant compared with 363 days posttransplant) and are associated with significantly higher mortality (60.5 versus 39.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The hospital environment itself can also be considered a risk factor for the development of fungal infection after lung transplantation, and center-specific outbreaks have been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>A general discussion of the pattern of infections seen following solid organ transplantation is discussed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58770\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58770 \">figure 1</a>).

Rarer manifestations include vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, endophthalmitis, empyema, retroperitoneal or intraabdominal abscess, pericarditis, and skin lesions. In a literature review that included 78 lung transplant recipients with aspergillosis, disseminated infection occurred in 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the increased risk of pulmonary fungal infections in lung transplant recipients, many centers employ frequent early surveillance bronchoscopies to examine the anastomosis as well as fungal staining and culture of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70685\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70685 \">table 2</a>). Practices for surveillance bronchoscopy vary widely by transplant center. At centers that routinely perform bronchoscopy, the primary purpose is to evaluate for allograft rejection although BAL provides an opportunity for extensive microbiologic sampling of the allograft. In addition, diagnostic bronchoscopies performed based upon clinical need (respiratory symptoms, radiographic abnormalities) are useful for the diagnosis of fungal infection.</p><p>The diagnosis of tracheobronchial aspergillosis is made by visualization of erythema, pseudomembranes, or ulcerations on bronchoscopy with confirmation by histopathology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fungal culture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62427\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62427 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Chest computed tomography (CT) can be helpful in patients with tracheobronchial aspergillosis, particularly when there are signs of lung involvement.</p><p>Although definitive diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis requires a biopsy demonstrating tissue invasion, evidence of a mold in the airway is suggestive of invasive infection in the right clinical context, such as when there are chest CT findings that are consistent with invasive infection. In lung transplant recipients, BAL <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transbronchial lung biopsy is helpful in proving the diagnosis, but cultures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fungal stains are positive in only 50 to 70 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. CT scan findings range from consolidation (40 percent) to cavitary lesions (30 percent) to nodular or mass-like lesions (30 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74744\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74744 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Detection of fungal antigens such as galactomannan has been used to increase sensitivity of detecting <em>Aspergillus </em>from BAL fluid. However, a positive BAL galactomannan is not specific for invasive disease, because poor airway clearance can be associated with colonization alone. (See <a href=\"#H1838389\" class=\"local\">'Galactomannan, beta-D-glucan, and PCR'</a> below.)</p><p>CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the CNS is advised in lung transplant recipients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis to evaluate for dissemination.

When used, prophylaxis is focused on reducing the risk of pulmonary mold infections, such as invasive aspergillosis.

However, at least one center that practices this approach in the early postoperative period reported a relatively high incidence of fungal pleural space infections, suggesting that a disadvantage of inhaled therapy is the failure to prevent systemic fungal infections, including pleural space infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>An alternative approach involves using systemic therapy with an azole with activity against molds, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a>.

In a meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials that included 1245 immunocompromised patients without HIV infection who had undergone autologous hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplantation or had a hematologic malignancy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis was associated with a 91 percent reduction in the occurrence of PCP (relative risk [RR] 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.32) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Mortality due to PCP was also significantly reduced (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03-0.94), although all-cause mortality was not. No differences in efficacy were found between once-daily and thrice-weekly administration schedules for TMP-SMX. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>Although PCP prophylaxis is highly effective, some cases have still been reported in the setting of prophylaxis. For example, in a series of 609 bronchoscopies performed (surveillance and clinically indicated) in lung and heart-lung transplant recipients at a single center from 1994 to 2002, 23 samples were positive for <em>P. jirovecii</em>, 15 of which were from patients receiving prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Seven of these 15 patients were taking inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a>, which is less effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>. Furthermore, two samples were positive in samples obtained from surveillance bronchoscopies, which could have represented colonization rather than infection.</p><p>TMP-SMX is recommended for all patients who can tolerate it, given its excellent efficacy and its broad spectrum against a range of organisms in addition to <em>P. jirovecii</em> (eg, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, <em>Listeria </em>spp, <em>Nocardia </em>spp, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The usual dosing of TMP-SMX for lung transplant recipients is one double-strength tablet daily or three times per week, continued indefinitely. Daily dosing is needed for patients at increased risk of toxoplasmosis (donor <span class=\"nowrap\">seropositive/recipient</span> seronegative). For those who are intolerant of TMP-SMX, desensitization should be attempted when possible. Alternative regimens are discussed separately.
