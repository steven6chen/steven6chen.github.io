(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Rhythm versus rate control'</a> below.)</p><p>For those patients in whom a rhythm control strategy is chosen, the main goal of therapy is to reduce symptoms by decreasing the frequency and duration of episodes as well as the symptoms during recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. As antiarrhythmic drugs are associated with a potential for serious adverse side effects, particularly the induction of proarrhythmia, they should be prescribed only by practitioners familiar with their use. Patients should be fully informed of both the benefits and risks associated with the use of these drugs. (See <a href=\"#H523855015\" class=\"local\">'Drug-related arrhythmias and mortality'</a> below.)</p><p>Rhythm control can be achieved with either antiarrhythmic drug therapy or nonpharmacologic methods. This topic provides recommendations for the former. The clinical trials describing the efficacy and toxicity (including proarrhythmia) of the different antiarrhythmic drugs are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-trials\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation: Clinical trials&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nonpharmacologic methods to maintain sinus rhythm (including surgery and radiofrequency ablation or cryoballoon ablation) in selected patients who are refractory to conventional therapy are discussed elsewhere.

Our recommendations for the use of these two strategies are found elsewhere.

Examples include hyperthyroidism, hypertension, heart failure, sleep apnea, and excess alcohol intake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Chronic disease associations'</a>.)</p><p>Maintenance antiarrhythmic drug therapy is not recommended after cardioversion in a patient with a transient or reversible cause (such as cardiac surgery, pericarditis, or pulmonary embolism). An option in such patients is beta blocker therapy after restoration of sinus rhythm, which may provide modest protection against recurrent AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, short-term antiarrhythmic therapy can be considered in this situation as the underlying cause is treated in patients who are highly symptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523851008\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic anticoagulation is required with either rhythm or rate control in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. An exception to this need for maintenance anticoagulation occurs in patients without structural heart disease who are at low risk for embolization; such patients can be treated with no long-term antithrombotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, anticoagulation is required for at least three weeks prior to, during, and for at least four weeks after cardioversion in patients with AF duration of longer than 48 hours. After four weeks of anticoagulation, individuals who do not require long-term anticoagulation can discontinue the medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of embolization prior to and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523851208\"><span class=\"h2\">AV nodal blocker therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocker is usually started before, or simultaneously with, antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients who have demonstrated a moderate to rapid ventricular rate (&ge;110 beats per minute) during AF. Slowing of the rate generally improves symptoms prior to the restoration of sinus rhythm. This therapy is continued while the patient is in sinus rhythm to protect against a rapid ventricular rate (greater than 110 bpm) should AF recur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Nonpharmacologic therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A beta blocker, or rate-slowing calcium channel blocker such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, is often used if there are no contraindications, since the withdrawal of vagal tone and increase in sympathetic tone with exercise often render <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> relatively ineffective for controlling the heart rate. Beta blockers may be preferred, since they also modestly protect against recurrence of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Although verapamil may protect against AF-induced electrical remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>], it has not been shown to prevent recurrence of AF during long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> is often used in patients with AF associated with systolic heart failure because of its beneficial effect on symptom control. Such patients are also typically treated with a beta blocker because of the associated improvement in survival. The negative inotropic activity of calcium channel blockers makes them less desirable in such patients. Digoxin may also be helpful when blood pressure is a limiting factor to uptitration of other nodal agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, AV nodal blockade is useful to prevent a 1:1 response should atrial flutter occur after cardioversion or when class IA or IC drugs are used. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 1</a>), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, may suppress most, but not all, reentrant circuits. Although the atrial myocardium may not be capable of sustaining AF in this setting, it may be able to generate and sustain atrial flutter. In addition, the profound sodium channel blocking effects of the class IC drugs can markedly slow atrial conduction, making atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction a significant risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523851252\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible role of angiotensin inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possible role of angiotensin inhibition to prevent recurrent AF is discussed elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients with relatively infrequent episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can be managed with antiarrhythmic therapy given only at the time of the episode.
