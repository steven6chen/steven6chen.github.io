Early identification and effective treatment of hearing loss improves language, communication, and cognitive skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>The treatment of hearing loss in children is reviewed here. The etiology and evaluation of hearing loss in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-loss-in-children-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing loss in children: Etiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing impairment in children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, all children with permanent hearing loss should be managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes audiologists, otolaryngologists, speech pathologists, geneticists, and educational specialists. In addition, these children should be referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist, because they rely on sight for communication and learning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The hearing-impaired child should also be referred to the appropriate educational agency. In some states, referral is mandatory within a limited time after identification. The local school district or early childhood intervention agency is equipped to provide educational guidance for the special needs of hearing-impaired children. This may include preferential seating or the use of frequency modulated systems at school. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Assistive listening devices'</a> below.)</p><p>Educational options vary according to the degree of hearing loss and cognitive ability of the child. Development of communication skills is the basic goal of early education programs for hearing-impaired children. Most agencies work with the team of professionals to establish an individual treatment plan for each child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF UNDERLYING CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to treat underlying etiology if possible. Some conditions associated with hearing loss are amenable to surgical intervention:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent acute otitis media and middle ear effusion &ndash; Tympanostomy tube placement may improve hearing for children with middle ear effusion, eustachian tube dysfunction, or recurrent acute otitis media. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tympanostomy tube placement, postoperative care, and complications in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-prevention-of-recurrence#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Prevention of recurrence&quot;, section on 'Tympanostomy tubes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management#H170941175\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Tympanostomy tubes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors and cholesteatomas require surgical excision or mastoidectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholesteatoma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholesteatoma in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perilymph fistula &ndash; Children with fluctuating or progressive sensorineural hearing loss may occasionally benefit from surgical exploration for and repair of a perilymph fistula. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-etiology-and-differential-diagnosis-of-vertigo#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, etiology, and differential diagnosis of vertigo&quot;, section on 'Perilymphatic fistula'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Some conditions that cause conductive hearing loss can be treated with either surgery or amplification (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the ear&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Otosclerosis or other ossicular chain abnormalities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stenosis of the external auditory canal (EAC)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some cases of atresia of the EAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HEARING AIDS AND ASSISTIVE DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The next step in the management of hearing loss, after the underlying etiology is addressed when possible, is hearing amplification. The initial stage in providing successful hearing amplification is for the audiologist and the parents, child, and other family members to agree that the child has hearing loss and will benefit from a hearing aid. A second opinion is sometimes necessary to convince the parents of this fact. Parents should know that hearing aids do not necessarily restore hearing to normal, but improved hearing is expected. Amplification before the age of six months improves language outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hearing aids</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A range of hearing aid styles, types, and costs is available. The choice of a hearing aid for each child is made on an individual basis in consultation with an audiologist and the parents. The best hearing aid for the child is determined by the results of the formal audiologic evaluation, the age of the child, the level and type of hearing loss, and <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> preference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Fitting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In young children, it may be difficult to know whether a hearing aid is correctly fit or too loud. Measurement of sound intensity in the ear canal with a tiny microphone (Real Ear) can address this problem. Computer programs are available that use real ear measurements or simulated real ear measurements to help the audiologist determine whether a particular device is appropriate for a given child. The desired sensation level approach estimates a frequency gain target that amplifies speech to audible levels across a broad frequency range and is beneficial in fitting hearing aids for very young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Style</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The styles of hearing aids available include bone conduction, behind the ear, in the ear, and completely in the canal instruments. Bone conduction hearing aids are used for children who have atretic ears or chronic otorrhea. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Bone conduction hearing devices'</a> below.)</p><p>Most hearing aids fit for children are behind the ear instruments, because the ear mold that is coupled to the ear is easily remade as the child grows. In the ear and in the canal instruments are more cosmetically appealing to teenagers. These devices are appropriate only for hearing loss less than 60 decibels (dB).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Electronic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electronic circuitry and signal processing options also must be considered when selecting a hearing aid. Circuitry can be analog, digital, or digitally programmable. The advantages of digital and programmable hearing aids over conventional analog hearing aids include better sound quality, increased precision, improved speech recognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], and flexibility of settings. The disadvantage is higher cost. Most digital hearing aids are not appropriate for children with profound hearing loss; however, several programmable aids provide adequate gain for children with severe to profound losses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Assistive listening devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assistive listening systems are designed to improve hearing perception, especially in noisy environments. They consist of a microphone for the speaker, a frequency modulated (FM) transmitter, and a receiver worn by the listener. These are available as standalone units, or the FM receiver can be attached to a hearing aid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Assistive listening systems provide gain (amplification) and improve signal to noise ratio by eliminating background noise. Most FM assistive devices are used for educational purposes, but they can help in other listening situations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling and education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parents should be encouraged to purchase an extended warranty or insurance plan for hearing aids. Most manufacturers offer extended warranties at reasonable prices. Some insurance companies specialize in coverage for hearing aids.</p><p>The fitting of hearing aids and assistive devices can be a stressful time for parents of hearing-impaired children. They may need counseling and support in addition to written information on hearing loss, hearing aids, and troubleshooting tips. Regular follow-up sessions with the audiologist are necessary to establish aided benefit and to check the fit of the hearing aids and ear mold.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">BONE CONDUCTION HEARING DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients who are unable to benefit from a standard air conduction device (a conventional hearing aid) may benefit from a device that transmits sound directly through the skull. Bone conduction hearing aids can be held against the skull with a steel-spring or soft headband. Improvements in design have led to instruments that are more comfortable and provide better sound. However, an implantable bone conduction hearing aid still has significant advantages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>].</p><p>The main implantable system available is a bone-anchored implantable hearing aid system, known as BAHA. A small titanium screw is inserted and osseointegrates with the bone of the skull over several months. An abutment is attached to the screw such that a small portion of the abutment sticks out through the skin and forms an attachment point for a removable bone conduction hearing aid. The sound quality is superior to that of traditional bone conduction hearing aids. Other implantable systems that directly vibrate the ossicles in the middle ear have become available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Potential indications for an implantable system include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital atresia of the ear canal such that it does not exist or cannot accommodate a standard hearing aid (provided that the nerve is functional) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the ear&quot;, section on 'Aural atresia (external auditory canal atresia)'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic infection of the middle or outer ear that is exacerbated by a standard hearing aid</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic reactions to standard hearing aids</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single-sided deafness as may occur after removal of a vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma), from trauma, or from a viral or vascular insult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]</p><p/><p>Children are typically approximately six years of age before BAHA is feasible, because 3 to 4 mm of bone is needed to ensure osseointegration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The BAHA may be implanted either unilaterally or bilaterally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A systematic review of observational studies of BAHA in both children and adults found greater audiologic benefits (eg, hearing sensitivity in quiet, speech perception in quiet and in noise, and <span class=\"nowrap\">localization/lateralization)</span> in patients with bilateral compared with unilateral placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">COCHLEAR IMPLANTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2639442650\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cochlear implants are surgically-implanted prosthetic devices that electrically stimulate the cochlear nerve to provide hearing. The device consists of a battery-powered external processor (that looks like a hearing aid), a receiver coil implanted below the scalp, and an electrode inserted directly into the cochlea through a surgical opening.</p><p>The criteria for selecting cochlear implantation include severe to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and little or no benefit from hearing aid use after six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>] in patients who desire access to audition and spoken language.</p><p>Cochlear implant devices (including those from Advanced Bionics, Med-El, and Clarion) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in children as young as 12 months, although off-label use has occurred for infants &lt;12 months old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A meta-analysis suggests that the role of cochlear implantation in children less than 12 months of age remains unclear, since the literature is lacking in prospective studies or long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In children with postmeningitic deafness, whose course is often complicated by formation of scar tissue and ossification within the cochlea, earlier cochlear implantation may be warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].The advantage of early auditory stimulation during the &quot;critical period&quot; of hearing development needs to be balanced against the risks of the procedure.</p><p>Bilateral cochlear implants have been advocated as they allow a child to hear better in conditions with background noise (such as restaurants), localize sound, and hear sound coming from either side without having to turn the head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Arguments against bilateral implantation have included increased surgical and anesthetic risk, risk to residual hearing, and saving one ear for future technologies. If chosen, bilateral implants are either performed simultaneously in the same operation or sequentially in separate surgeries. Studies demonstrate benefit from bilateral implantation with any length of time between surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]; however, improved response at the brainstem and greater expressive language development is noted in patients with minimized duration between implants, with the greatest response seen in patients with simultaneous implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/35,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,39,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative evaluation for a cochlear implant includes computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the temporal bone to evaluate the patency of the cochlea, identify congenital malformations, and assess surgical anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Audiometric testing should be well documented. Other important prerequisites include access to an education program that stresses auditory and verbal skills and highly-motivated parents who have realistic expectations. Because of the increased risk of meningitis in children with cochlear implants, immunization against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Haemophilus influenza</em> is recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cochlear-implant-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cochlear implant infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cochlear implantation in children provides auditory detection over much of the speech signal and results in improved auditory discrimination and speech production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In one study, the language achievement of 29 prelingually deaf children three or more years after cochlear implantation was compared with the achievement of 29 prelingually deaf children who were treated with hearing aids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The children with cochlear implants had better language comprehension and production skills.</p><p>Children whose deafness occurs after age two years, who are deaf for short periods of time, who use oral communication, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who are implanted at an earlier age have the best language outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/41,43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43-46</a>]. As an example, the speech perception and production skills of three groups of children were analyzed after cochlear implantation: 70 children who were congenitally deaf, 22 children who were deafened by meningitis before two years of age, and 14 children who were deafened by meningitis after two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The speech perception skills of the groups of children who were deafened after age two were better than those of the other two groups. No difference was found in speech perception or production skills between the two groups of children whose deafness began before age two years.</p><p>Speech perception was measured three, four, and five years after cochlear implantation in 40 children who were born deaf or who became deaf before three years of age and who had no measurable speech perception before implantation with the most powerful hearing aids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Speech perception improved with time (27, 35, and 45 mean words per minute at three, four, and five years of follow-up, respectively). Improvement in speech perception was greater for children who were younger at the time of implantation and who used oral, rather than total, communication (eg, including signing).</p><p>The language outcome may be poorer in children with underlying motor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cognitive disabilities, such as those with congenital cytomegalovirus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], and in those with hypoplastic inner ear malformations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cochlear nerve deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Severe inner ear dysplasia is also associated with a poorer audiologic outcome and increased surgical difficulty, including a higher rate of intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid gushers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>Educational and employment achievements were examined in a series of 100 prelingually deaf children who received cochlear implants before six years of age and were followed for at least four years after implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Most children without additional disabilities were in mainstream schools. Approximately one-quarter experienced delayed reading and writing skills, and approximately one-half repeated a grade. Despite this, the educational and employment levels ultimately achieved in this group were comparable with that of their peers with normal hearing.</p><p>Cochlear implant failure, due to medical complications (infection or wound dehiscence) or device failure, is rare and is associated with a history of meningitis as the cause of deafness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-treatment/abstract/54-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-58</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Hearing aids and assistive devices'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone conduction hearing aids are devices that transmit sound directly through the skull. Bone conduction hearing aids are used in certain patients who are unable to benefit from a standard air conduction device (a conventional hearing aid), such as those with congenital aural atresia. These devices are held against the skull or bone anchored. The latter method is preferred in most cases, although children are typically approximately six years of age before the bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) is feasible because 3 to 4 mm of bone is needed to ensure osseointegration. The BAHA may be implanted either unilaterally or bilaterally. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Bone conduction hearing devices'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cochlear implants electrically stimulate the cochlear nerve to provide hearing. For patients with profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss who have had little or no benefit from hearing aid use after six months, we recommend cochlear implants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest bilateral, rather than unilateral, implantation and minimizing the time between implants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
