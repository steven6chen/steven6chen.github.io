It is found worldwide, with a prevalence of approximately one case in 30,000 live births in most populations. Impaired biliary copper excretion leads to accumulation of copper in several organs, most notably the liver, brain, and cornea. Over time, the liver is progressively damaged and eventually becomes cirrhotic. The rate at which this occurs varies between patients. A small percent of patients (approximately 5 percent) develop acute liver failure, most often in the setting of advanced fibrosis of the liver. In addition, patients may develop neurologic complications, which can be severe.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history of Wilson disease. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of Wilson disease, as well as a detailed discussion of the individual tests used to diagnose Wilson disease, are discussed separately.

Hemolysis is also a common finding in patients with acute liver failure due to Wilson disease, but sometimes may occur episodically independent of liver failure.</p><p>Patients may present with a wide variety of symptoms (especially those with neurologic symptoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Even within a given family, patients often present with different symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

For patients with Wilson disease, a critical copper excretory pathway fails to develop or is dysfunctional, and copper accumulation begins at birth and continues throughout life, gradually producing clinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The majority of patients with Wilson disease are diagnosed between the ages of 5 and 35 years (mean age of 13 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], though this disorder has been diagnosed in younger patients and in patients in their 70s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/1,12,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,16,17</a>].

Children diagnosed through family screening because of an affected sibling are often asymptomatic. In other patients, liver disease may progress silently, often until adolescence, when complications of cirrhosis or acute liver failure may develop. In some cases, neurologic or psychiatric manifestations may precede overt liver disease.</p><p>Unlike children, who are more likely to present with hepatic manifestations, older patients (mid-teens and older) are more likely to present with neurologic manifestations.

Hepatic manifestations range widely and include asymptomatic biochemical abnormalities and steatosis, acute hepatitis and acute liver failure (with an associated Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia), chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis.

The degree of transaminase elevation in patients with Wilson disease is usually less compared with patients with acute viral hepatitis. In some patients, the symptoms will resolve spontaneously (though Wilson disease is still present and requires treatment), whereas others may rapidly deteriorate and develop acute liver failure. Acute liver failure refers to the rapid (typically in less than 8 to 12 weeks) development of severe acute liver injury with impaired synthetic function with coagulopathy and encephalopathy in a person who previously had a normal liver. In Wilson disease, the development of acute liver failure differs in that it is development of acute-on-chronic liver disease, as most patients have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis at the time of development of acute liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The tremor is a low-frequency, high-amplitude tremor that is most prominent when the patient's arms are held outstretched laterally or with the arms extended in front of the patient with the palms facing downward and the elbows flexed. The tremor increases in amplitude with increased duration of posture holding. The name comes from the fact that the movement of the patient's arms may be reminiscent of a bird's flapping wings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A unilateral rest tremor may be present, but is rarely seen in isolation.

The movements are involuntary and non-patterned with variable speed, timing, and direction, flowing from one body part to another. In less severe cases, this can result in an appearance of fidgetiness.

When severe and with proximal muscle involvement, choreic movements may result in violent, uncontrolled flailing movements of the extremities (ballism). Athetosis refers to slower writhing movements with a sinuous quality. The term choreoathetosis is used when typical choreic movements coexist with athetosis.

The cancers included cholangiocarcinoma (three patients), poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of undetermined primary site (five patients) and HCC (three patients). The incidence of cancer appeared to be related to the duration of disease. No cancers were seen in patients followed for less than 10 years, compared with an incidence of 4.2 percent in those followed for 10 to 19 years, 5.3 percent for those followed for 20 to 29 years, and 15 percent for those followed for 30 to 39 years.</p><p>Whether the risk of cancer was increased compared with the general population is difficult to determine from this report since it did not include a control group. The higher incidence of cancer in those followed for longer may have been at least in part related to their older age and longer duration of follow-up. On the other hand, the types of cancer seen (occurring in organs affected by copper deposition) support a possible association with Wilson disease.</p><p>The risk for developing HCC in patients with Wilson disease was also examined in two studies from Europe. In the first study, the prevalence of hepatobiliary malignancies in 1186 patients with Wilson disease was 1.2 percent, and the incidence was 0.28 per 1000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In the second study, 130 patients were followed for a mean of 15 years, and two patients with HCC were found: one at time of diagnosis and the other after 50 years of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The estimated annual HCC risk was 0.09 percent for patients overall and was 0.14 percent for patients with cirrhosis. In both of these studies, the annual incidence of HCC did not reach thresholds for which screening and surveillance for HCC are recommended (cost-effectiveness models suggest that in patients with cirrhosis, surveillance becomes cost-effective once the annual incidence of HCC exceeds 1.5 to 2 percent). However, given the ability to change survival with detection of early lesions, it may still be useful to do screening and surveillance by ultrasound, but the cost-effectiveness is not certain.
