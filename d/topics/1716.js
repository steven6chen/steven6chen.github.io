The pain may be sharp and shooting, burning, or aching, and may be felt anywhere in the back.</p><p>Although back pain may be a sign of a more concerning problem, especially in children younger than 10 years, most episodes of back pain in children are not serious and resolve without treatment.</p><p>This topic will review the most common causes of back pain in children, treatments that can be tried at home, and a guide to when the child should see his or her health care provider. Back pain in adults is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low back pain in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BACK PAIN CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of low back pain in children is muscle sprain and strain. This can occur while playing, from carrying a heavy backpack, or after a fall.</p><p>Less common causes include abnormalities in the spinal bones (vertebrae), infections, arthritis, and, rarely, cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SEEK HELP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contact your child's health care provider if your child has one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain that is severe, occurs at night or wakes the child from sleep, or worsens over time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain accompanied by fever (temperature &gt;100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain accompanied by weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain in a child under five years of age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg weakness, walking with a limp, or refusing to walk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain that developed after a recent injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Past history of cancer or tuberculosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change in bowel or bladder control (eg, new accidents)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain that prevents the child from participating in normal activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain that is accompanied by morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">BACK PAIN DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To determine the most likely cause of a child's back pain, the health care provider will ask questions and will perform a physical examination. Blood tests and x-rays or other imaging tests are not always needed, especially if the back pain began recently. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the child with back pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">BACK PAIN TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child has back pain but has none of the warning signs described above (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'When to seek help'</a> above), it is reasonable to try some home treatments initially. However, if the child's pain does not improve, call the child's health care provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonprescription pain medications, such as acetaminophen (sample brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) may help to reduce a child's back pain. These medications are particularly helpful for back pain caused by overuse, strains, and sprains.</p><p>These medications should be given according to the child's weight, rather than age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Heat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Applying heat can help with back pain during the first few days after overuse or an injury. You may use a heating pad, hot water bottle, or other hot pack. Be careful to avoid burning the skin with a pack or pad that is too hot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Remaining active</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Staying active can help to relieve muscle spasms and prevents weakening of the muscles. On the other hand, back pain caused by overexertion may not improve without rest. Thus, high-impact activities (running, jumping, or other activities that cause pain) should be avoided while the child has pain. It is fine for the child to continue with regular day-to-day activities and light exercise that does not cause pain.</p><p>Bed rest is not recommended. Children who prefer to remain completely inactive should be evaluated by a health care provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Stretching and strengthening exercises</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the pain begins to improve, your child's health care provider may recommend specific stretching and strengthening exercises. A physical therapist can help to design a program tailored to your child.</p><p>Activities such as walking, swimming, bicycling, and other low-impact activities are also recommended. The child should temporarily avoid activities that involve twisting or bending, are high impact, or that make the back hurt more.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child's health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your child's medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=97145\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
