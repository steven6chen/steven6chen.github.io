The risk to the fetus depends on a number of factors, including the timing of the excess maternal androgen production, the severity of the increase, and the condition causing the increase. However, normal women do not experience symptoms or signs of hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism) as a result of this physiologic rise in androgen concentrations, probably due to the overwhelming increases in estrogens associated with pregnancy that mitigate this small degree of unsustained hyperandrogenemia during the end of gestation. This topic will review the causes and clinical features of gestational hyperandrogenism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59214\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59214 \">table 1</a>). The approach to the patient with gestational hyperandrogenism is discussed separately.

The two most common causes of gestational hyperandrogenism are luteomas and theca-lutein cysts of the ovary.</p><p>An increase in androgen production in a pregnant woman can cause virilization in both the woman and fetus. The extent of fetal virilization varies, depending on the time of onset of the increased maternal androgen production, its severity, and unknown factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66532\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66532 \">table 3</a>). For example, fetal virilization is common in virilized pregnant women with luteomas but extremely rare in those with theca-lutein cysts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H761030994\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of androgen exposure and fetal risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Female external genital development occurs between <strong>7 and 12 weeks</strong> of gestation; androgen exposure during this period may result in partial or complete labial fusion and clitoral hypertrophy.

Female external genital development occurs between <strong>7 and 12 weeks</strong> of gestation; excessive androgen exposure during this period may result in partial or complete labial fusion and clitoral hypertrophy. After the 12<sup>th</sup> week of gestation, clitoral hypertrophy remains a risk, but the risk of labial fusion no longer occurs. Male fetuses are not affected.</p><p>In the past, several cases of fetal virilization occurred after exposure to very high doses of progestins, most notably, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> (40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> which was used early in pregnancy to prevent miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. However, exposure to progestins is no longer considered to be a risk for fetal virilization, as high progestin doses are no longer used. For example, the dose of norethindrone in a standard oral estrogen-progestin contraceptive is typically 1 mg, and androgen-associated adverse effects have not been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3433683555\"><span class=\"h2\">Nontumorous ovarian causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most common causes of gestational hyperandrogenism are ovarian luteomas and theca-lutein cysts of the ovary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3048168246\"><span class=\"h3\">Luteomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian luteomas are hyperplastic masses of large lutein cells, not true tumors, which regress and disappear within two to three weeks after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The incidence of these lesions is probably greater than reported because most are unnoticed, either because they secrete lower levels of potent androgens or the minimal effects of larger amounts of weaker androgens (like androstenedione) that escape detection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-gestational-hyperandrogenism#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with gestational hyperandrogenism&quot;, section on 'Luteomas'</a>.)</p><p>These subclinical luteomas may be discovered incidentally at the time of cesarean section or laparotomy for an unrelated indication such as uterine hemorrhage or postpartum tubal ligation. In contrast, some women with pregnancy luteomas present with mass-related symptoms from ureteral compression, obstructive uropathy, or ovarian torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The incidence may be greater in black than white women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Luteomas are so called because of their yellow or yellow-brown solid masses, often with dark red areas of hemorrhage that are composed of masses of large lutein cells resembling corpora lutea. They are usually from 6 to 10 cm in diameter (range 1 to 25 cm) and, while sharply circumscribed, are not encapsulated. Bilateral luteomas occur in approximately 45 to 50 percent of cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66532\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66532 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/1,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12</a>]. The possible stimulatory role of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on hormone secretion by these masses is described below. (See <a href=\"#H2299785376\" class=\"local\">'Role of hCG in androgen excess'</a> below.)</p><p>As compared with normal pregnant women, those with luteomas have much higher serum concentrations of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/1,11,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,13-15</a>]. Studies of tumor tissue have revealed synthesis and secretion of substantial quantities of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione. In patients with pregnancy luteomas, extreme elevations in testosterone concentrations have been described (11,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> in one case report that fall quickly to 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> by three weeks postpartum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Although serum testosterone concentrations normalize postpartum in women with luteomas, virilizing symptoms such as deepening of the voice and clitoromegaly are not reversible.</p><p>High maternal serum androgen concentrations are not always associated with fetal virilization. Maternal hirsutism or virilization is present in approximately 30 to 35 percent of reported cases of pregnancy luteoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>], indicating either that serum androgen concentrations are often only mildly elevated or that androgen action is blunted. The latter could occur because the increase in serum free testosterone is blunted by the increase in serum SHBG concentrations that occur during pregnancy, so that less testosterone is available to peripheral tissues, or because the tissue effects of testosterone are blunted by the actions of estrogen. Alternatively, some luteomas may secrete weaker androgens like androstenedione (versus testosterone or dihydrotestosterone).</p><p>Case reports of two women with luteomas of pregnancy who were not virilized yet and who had very high serum testosterone concentrations (2650 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [92 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L]</span> and 2830 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [98 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L]</span> when normal gestational concentrations are 50 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [1.7 to 4.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> illustrate the heterogeneity of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Among women with luteomas, approximately 80 percent of female infants born to virilized mothers are virilized, whereas the fetuses are not virilized if the mother is not.<strong> </strong>When estimating the risk of virilization of a fetus in utero, several factors merit consideration, including the sex of the fetus, the duration of exposure to androgens, and, most importantly, the stage of pregnancy during which the exposure took place (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66532\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66532 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Cord serum androgen concentrations have been measured in only a few infants whose mothers had marked hyperandrogenism due to luteomas of pregnancy. Three infants, a male and two nonvirilized females, had normal cord serum androgen concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. Two other infants had high cord serum testosterone concentrations; one was a virilized female infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and the other was a premature nonvirilized male infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Based upon these very limited data, the risk of virilization of a female infant appears to be correlated with serum testosterone concentrations in the fetus but not the mother. Maternal hyperandrogenemia is therefore a necessary, but not sufficient, cause of virilization of a female infant, indicating that other factors, such as placental androgen degradation, must be important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2046177768\"><span class=\"h3\">Theca-lutein cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Theca-lutein cysts, also known as hyperreactio luteinalis, are a type of <a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/articles/functional-ovarian-cyst&amp;token=7O6KNp+aNdiylnAwIF2rhQCKsOgJrYw3AwWCzUe2fuUIoGvpzBs00FkWE8F3Uqo/yiHpCkTAnReGXbzdWTKDyQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7448\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">functional ovarian cyst</a> that are typically bilateral and multiple. The incidence of gestational theca-lutein cysts is highest (10 to 22 percent) in women with trophoblastic disease. The frequency is also increased in women with multiple or isoimmunized gestations and diabetes mellitus. These figures refer to women who had multicystic ovaries that were easily palpable at pelvic examination or were seen at laparotomy. However, the true incidence is probably higher; it has been suggested that similar cysts can be found on pathologic examination of the ovaries in most women with trophoblastic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of Rhesus D alloimmunization in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mothers with preexisting hirsutism such as those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are more likely to have theca-lutein cysts as the source of their androgen excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Women with PCOS have higher serum androgen concentrations during pregnancy than normal women but not high enough to cause virilization (unless they also develop theca-lutein cysts).</p><p>The size of ovaries containing theca-lutein cysts in pregnant women has ranged from normal to 10 to 15 cm; large cysts can cause troublesome pressure symptoms. The ovarian cortex usually shows focal hyalinization, with multiple cysts below the surface and stromal congestion and edema. The cyst fluid ranges from clear to amber to blood-tinged, and the cysts have thin smooth yellow-tinged walls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Approximately 30 percent of pregnant women with theca-lutein cysts have hirsutism or are virilized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66532\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66532 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/1,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21-23</a>]. Many, if not all, virilized women have high serum testosterone and androstenedione concentrations, and cord serum testosterone concentrations in infants of virilized mothers are either normal or high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. However, despite the presence of maternal virilization and, in some cases, elevated cord serum testosterone concentrations, only one case of a virilized female infant has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]; all other female infants have been normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66532\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66532 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/1,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26,27</a>].

This concept is supported by the regression of tumor mass and prompt decline in serum androgens and urinary 17-ketosteroid excretion to normal after delivery as well as the high occurrence of multiple luteomas with excessive hCG administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Typically, most luteomas are diagnosed late in pregnancy, ie, considerably later than the time of peak hCG production, which occurs after 60 to 90 days of gestation; furthermore, theca-lutein cysts, not luteomas, are the characteristic ovarian lesion among women who produce excessive amounts of this hormone, such as those with trophoblastic disease. Thus, some hCG may be necessary for hormone production by luteomas, but there must be another factor(s) causing growth and androgen production in late gestation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Theca-lutein cysts</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Those women likely to have theca-lutein cysts (diabetic or isoimmunized pregnant women or women with multiple gestation or trophoblastic disease) tend to have increased hCG production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].
