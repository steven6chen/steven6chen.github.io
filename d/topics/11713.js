A typical urticarial lesion is an intensely pruritic, erythematous plaque (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78544\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78544 \">picture 1</a>). Urticaria is sometimes accompanied by angioedema, which is swelling deeper in the skin. A presumptive trigger, such as a drug, food ingestion, insect sting, or infection, may be identifiable in patients with new-onset urticaria, although no specific cause is found in many cases, particularly when the condition persists for weeks or months. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Etiologies'</a> below.)</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, etiologies, diagnosis, and management of new-onset urticaria will be reviewed here.

More than two-thirds of cases of new-onset urticaria prove to be self-limited (acute) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-urticaria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The lesions of acute and chronic urticaria are identical in appearance, so when the problem first develops, it is not possible to differentiate the two disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-urticaria/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urticaria affects up to 20 percent of the population at some point in their lives and occurs across the age spectrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-urticaria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urticarial lesions are circumscribed, raised, erythematous plaques, often with central pallor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F90166\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90166 \">picture 2</a>). Lesions may be round, oval, or serpiginous in shape and vary in size from less than 1 centimeter to several centimeters in diameter. They are intensely itchy. Pruritus may disrupt work, school, or sleep. Symptoms often seem most severe at night.</p><p>Individual lesions are transient, usually appearing and enlarging over the course of minutes to hours and then disappearing within 24 hours. Lesions may coalesce as they enlarge. Urticarial lesions are not normally painful and resolve without leaving residual ecchymotic marks on the skin, unless there is trauma from scratching. If lesions are long-lasting, painful, or leave residual bruising, the diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H10818951\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Any area of the body may be affected, although areas in which clothing compresses the skin (eg, under waistbands) or skin rubs together (axillae) are sometimes affected more dramatically. Typically, compressed areas become more severely affected once the restricting clothing has been removed.</p><p>Angioedema, when associated with urticaria, usually affects the face and lips, extremities, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genitals. Angioedema <strong>without</strong> urticaria should prompt consideration of other angioedema disorders, such as drug-induced angioedema (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors), idiopathic angioedema, and hereditary and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency.

Basophils have also been identified in lesional biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-urticaria/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Mast cells and basophils release multiple mediators upon activation including histamine (which causes itching) and vasodilatory mediators (which cause localized swelling in the uppermost layers of the skin). The same process gives rise to angioedema when mast cells deeper in the dermis and subcutaneous tissues are activated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cells: Development, identification, and physiologic roles&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential causes of new-onset urticaria are numerous, although no specific etiology can be identified in many patients. Acute urticaria is more likely to have an identifiable etiology compared with chronic urticaria.

Immune activation, involving immune complex formation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complement activation, is a proposed mechanism, although the exact pathogenesis is unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In one study, common viral illnesses and bacterial infections (eg, urinary tract infections) were the leading identifiable trigger for acute urticaria in 57 children between the ages of one and three years who presented to an emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-urticaria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Many of these children had also received antibiotics, so it was not clear in these patients if the infection, the drug, or the combination had triggered urticaria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In another study, 88 children presenting to an emergency department with delayed cutaneous reactions while taking beta-lactam antibiotics were evaluated. Of these, 47 of 88 had urticarial eruptions.

Two-thirds had one or more positive viral studies, demonstrating infections with picornavirus (most common), coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and several others. When the children were later challenged with the culprit antibiotic, only 4 had recurrent urticaria. Thus, urticaria was related to the viral infection or the combination of the viral infection and the antibiotic in most, and only 4 of 88 had a drug allergy.

American practice parameters state that a limited evaluation &quot;may be considered&quot; in such patients, primarily for the purpose of detecting underlying disorders earlier in the one-third of patients in whom urticaria will prove persistent (ie, initial presentation of chronic urticaria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-urticaria/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In this setting, complete blood count with differential, urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and liver function tests are suggested. However, the author's approach is to obtain these tests in patients with persistent symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients in whom a specific etiology is suspected, laboratory studies and further evaluation should be directed at establishing or excluding that cause.

If the history does suggest a possible allergy, serum tests for allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies are appropriate, if commercially available. For example, if a patient who does not normally eat seafood but did so at a special occasion develops hives within 10 minutes of eating a crab cake, it would be reasonable to obtain a crab-specific IgE test, particularly if there were no other new foods ingested and the patient is avoiding seafood for fear of a repeat reaction. However, the interpretation of allergy tests can require some expertise. A positive result is suggestive, although not diagnostic, of allergy, and a negative result does not exclude allergy. Because of this, we suggest that patients suspected of having an allergy be referred to an <span class=\"nowrap\">allergist/immunologist</span> for further evaluation when possible. Skin tests with fresh food, which should be performed by an allergy specialist, is probably the most convenient, inexpensive, and sensitive way to detect food hypersensitivity.

However, viral exanthems are generally not pruritic and usually consist of erythematous maculopapular eruptions that persist for days. Fever is often present.

However, a brief course (ie, usually a week or less) of systemic glucocorticoids may be added to antihistamine therapy for patients with prominent angioedema or if symptoms persist beyond a few days. Glucocorticoids do not inhibit mast cell degranulation but may act by suppressing a variety of contributing inflammatory mechanisms.</p><p>A small number of trials have examined the utility of glucocorticoids in the management of acute urticaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-urticaria/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>].

In this randomized trial, 100 adults presenting to the emergency department with urticaria of &le;24 hours duration without angioedema, anaphylaxis, or fever, were treated with the H1 antihistamine levocetirizine (5 mg once daily for five days) plus either placebo or prednisone (40 mg once daily for four days) and followed by phone for several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-urticaria/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The primary endpoint was complete relief of itching two days after the start of therapy, and secondary endpoints included resolution of skin lesions, relapses, and adverse events. Most subjects had resolution of itch by day 2, with a slightly lower percentage itch-free in the prednisone group (79 versus 67 percent). Similarly, by day 2, skin lesions had resolved entirely in 78 and 70 percent of those in the placebo and prednisone groups, respectively. Thus, the addition of prednisone to levocetirizine did not speed resolution of acute urticaria. Between one-quarter and one-third of patients experienced relapse in both groups, generally within the first few days of therapy. Another smaller randomized trial found that glucocorticoids were helpful when added to antihistamines, although the antihistamine regimen used in that study (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a> 25 mg orally every four to eight hours) may have been more difficult to adhere to [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-onset-urticaria/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Our approach is to treat all patients with H1 antihistamines, adding H2 antihistamines for more severe symptoms and reserving oral glucocorticoids for those patients with prominent angioedema or persistent symptoms despite antihistamines.</p><p>The optimal agent and dose have not been determined for acute urticaria, but we typically administer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> 30 to 60 mg daily, with tapering of the dose over five to seven days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisolone</a> 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (maximum 60 mg daily), with tapering of the dose over five to seven days</p><p/><p>Antihistamine therapy should be continued during and after the course of glucocorticoids because some patients experience an exacerbation as the glucocorticoids are tapered or discontinued. If symptoms do not recur over several days after stopping glucocorticoids, then antihistamines can be discontinued also. For patients whose symptoms recur when medications are discontinued, antihistamines should be reinstituted and used at the lowest effective dose.

Urticarial lesions are intensely pruritic, circumscribed, raised, erythematous plaques, often with central pallor. Morphology and size can vary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F90166\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90166 \">picture 2</a>). Uncomplicated urticarial lesions are pruritic cutaneous plaques that develop over minutes to hours and resolve in hours without residual markings.

Acute urticaria is defined as periodic outbreaks of urticarial lesions that resolve within six weeks, and two-thirds of all urticaria falls into this category. (See <a href=\"#H25448761\" class=\"local\">'Categorization of urticaria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A presumptive trigger, such as common viral and bacterial infections, medications, food ingestion, or insect sting, can sometimes be identified for new-onset urticaria. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Etiologies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasionally, urticaria may be the presenting feature of another systemic disorder, such as urticarial vasculitis, mastocytosis, or systemic lupus erythematous. There are specific clinical features that should prompt an evaluation for these conditions. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Systemic disorders that may include urticaria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of urticaria is made clinically. A careful history should be performed to exclude possible anaphylaxis, identify a possible trigger, and determine if there are signs or symptoms to suggest urticarial vasculitis or an underlying systemic disorder. If the history does not suggest a specific trigger or underlying systemic illness, then laboratory tests are usually normal and not helpful. Some guidelines advocate obtaining a complete blood count with differential, urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and liver function tests at initial presentation, while others suggest testing only if symptoms persist.
