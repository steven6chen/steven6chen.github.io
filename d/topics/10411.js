It is categorized as physiologic (occurring normally during infancy, puberty, and older age) or pathologic (due to drugs or disorders such as androgen deficiency, testicular tumors, hyperthyroidism, and chronic kidney disease). In adult men seeking consultation for gynecomastia, approximately 40 percent of cases of gynecomastia are due to persistent pubertal gynecomastia or medications and 25 percent are idiopathic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53468\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53468 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>True gynecomastia should be differentiated from pseudogynecomastia, which refers to fat deposition without glandular proliferation. Gynecomastia must also be differentiated from breast carcinoma, which is far less common.</p><p>The management of gynecomastia will be reviewed here.

In up to 20 percent, pubertal gynecomastia persists into adulthood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64368 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The simplest method to prevent or manage gynecomastia is to avoid or discontinue drugs that cause it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71421\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71421 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H215957494\" class=\"local\">'Stop offending drugs'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gynecomastia of recent onset (&lt;6 months) often regresses spontaneously, so observation alone is the initial step for many patients, especially those with pubertal gynecomastia or following the correction of the cause, such as discontinuation of a medication known to be associated with gynecomastia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20245823\" class=\"local\">'Observation only'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential indications for early medical therapy include significant breast enlargement (&gt;4 cm in diameter in young men), pain, tenderness, and embarrassment that interfere with the patient's normal daily activities (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> below). Surgical intervention might be needed in patients with persistent gynecomastia, including those with pubertal gynecomastia that persists into late adolescence or early adulthood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gynecomastia is the most symptomatic (pain and tenderness) and treatable in its early stages (first six months). After approximately 12 months, fibrotic tissue eventually replaces glandular tissue and tenderness resolves. Pharmacologic therapy is unlikely to be beneficial once fibrous tissue is present. Surgery effectively removes excess breast tissue at any time, but it is delayed until the underlying cause of gynecomastia has been addressed (to avoid recurrence after surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe gynecomastia, with large pendulous breasts and skin redundancy, is unlikely to respond to pharmacologic therapy and nearly always requires surgery for an optimal cosmetic result. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to unilateral gynecomastia is the same as for bilateral gynecomastia. It is especially important to distinguish unilateral gynecomastia from breast carcinoma and other lesions by physical examination, ultrasonography, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mammography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults#H409071425\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and evaluation of gynecomastia in adults&quot;, section on 'Further evaluation to rule out breast cancer'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to management begins with the simplest and least invasive steps, including observation only, stopping causative medications, and treating underlying medical problems associated with gynecomastia. If gynecomastia does not resolve within three months with these measures and the patient has pain and tenderness, medical therapy is typically the next step. Surgical intervention should be considered in men whose gynecomastia does not regress spontaneously, is causing considerable discomfort or psychological distress, or is long standing (greater than 12 months) and in which the fibrotic stage has been reached [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>A major factor that should influence the initial approach to management is the duration of gynecomastia. Histologic studies show that the glandular changes in the breast are the same regardless of etiology and that the extent of glandular proliferation depends upon the intensity and duration of the stimulation. The histologic picture changes over time with ductal hyperplasia and periductal inflammation in the early stages (first six months). During this time period, gynecomastia is the most symptomatic and also most treatable with medications.</p><p>Fibrosis and disappearance of the inflammatory reaction are found at 12 or more months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F57619%7EENDO%2F62060\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57619 graphicRef62060 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p>The goal in men with prostate cancer undergoing hormone therapy (androgen deprivation therapy or antiandrogen monotherapy) is to prevent the development of gynecomastia. The best options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> and radiation therapy. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Men with prostate cancer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215957494\"><span class=\"h2\">Stop offending drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the management of new gynecomastia is to discontinue, if possible, any drugs that cause it, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71421\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71421 \">table 2</a>). If the drug is identified as the cause of gynecomastia during the early, proliferative, and often painful phase, stopping it may result in regression of glandular tissue (within one month of stopping the drug) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. On the other hand, if the gynecomastia has been present for more than one year, stopping the offending drug is unlikely to result in spontaneous regression of glandular tissue, because fibrosis is likely to be present.</p><p>If gynecomastia and breast tenderness does not resolve within three months after stopping the causative drug or if the causative medication cannot be discontinued, medical therapy can be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20245823\"><span class=\"h2\">Observation only</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gynecomastia often regresses spontaneously, so observation alone is often the initial step (if there are no possible inciting drugs). This is only effective if the gynecomastia is in the early, proliferative phase (eg, present for less than one year). Otherwise, fibrosis is likely to be present, and glandular tissue will not regress spontaneously. We suggest observation without medical therapy after stopping offending medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treating any underlying disorders. Patients with recent-onset gynecomastia should be seen at three-month intervals to determine if the gynecomastia is resolving spontaneously or if a medication trial should be initiated.</p><p>Pubertal gynecomastia, a benign, physiologic process, typically develops between ages 10 and 12 years, with a peak prevalence of 65 percent between ages 13 and 14 years, followed by regression in 80 percent within six months to two years. It may persist into adulthood in up to 20 percent of individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64368 \">figure 2</a>). Observation alone is a reasonable approach in most adolescent boys.</p><p>Regression of gynecomastia is also common in adults. In one report, regression of breast tissue occurred in 85 percent of adult men with gynecomastia due to various causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In contrast, in therapeutic trials, complete spontaneous regression in men receiving drug therapy or placebo is much less frequent. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20245611\"><span class=\"h2\">Treat underlying condition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In men with gynecomastia due to an underlying treatable disorder such as hypogonadism or hyperthyroidism, we suggest treatment of the underlying disorder first, followed by observation with a follow-up breast examination in three months to see if the gynecomastia is resolving.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three classes of medications, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), aromatase inhibitors, and androgens (for men with hypogonadism), have been studied for the treatment of gynecomastia. For men with indications for medical therapy, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, unless they have hypogonadism, in which case we suggest testosterone therapy. Potential indications for early intervention with pharmacotherapy include pain, tenderness, and embarrassment that interfere with the patient's normal daily activities. Although they may not induce complete regression of gynecomastia, they may result in partial regression and relief of tenderness. None are approved for the treatment of gynecomastia.</p><p>Medical therapy may be effective in the early, active phase of gynecomastia but not in the late fibrotic stage (after 12 months). Surgical intervention might be necessary in patients with persistent gynecomastia, including those with pubertal gynecomastia that persists into late adolescence or early adulthood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Androgens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testosterone replacement in hypogonadal men often improves gynecomastia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>], but there is no rationale for its use in eugonadal men, in whom it may actually worsen the gynecomastia due to aromatization of the testosterone to estradiol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testosterone treatment of male hypogonadism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The nonaromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (available as a gel in some countries) has been reported to be effective for gynecomastia in uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], but there is insufficient information to recommend its use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For adolescent <strong>boys</strong> with severe breast enlargement that is confirmed to be glandular tissue and is causing substantial tenderness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> embarrassment, we suggest a brief trial (three months) of a SERM. A double-blind, randomized meta-analysis of six studies of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> therapy suggests that tamoxifen is beneficial and is well tolerated. A retrospective chart review of tamoxifen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> therapy reported that both drugs decreased glandular tissue, but neither resulted in complete resolution of the gynecomastia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>We currently use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> (20 mg once daily or 10 mg twice daily) for three months because there is inadequate experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> in this population. Patients and parents should be told that these drugs are not approved for this purpose.</p><p>For <strong>adults</strong> in whom no cause can be identified and the gynecomastia is tender and persists more than three months, we suggest a brief trial (three to six months) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> for relief of symptoms. Although clinical trial data are limited, tamoxifen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> appear to decrease breast volume in adults with gynecomastia. However, complete breast regression may not be achieved with this approach, and these drugs are not approved for the treatment of gynecomastia.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tamoxifen</a> therapy for up to three months has been reported to result in pain relief (for those with gynecomastia associated with pain and tenderness) and at least partial regression of glandular tissue in approximately 80 percent of men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/1,11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11-15</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective series, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> appeared to be more effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Adverse events in men taking tamoxifen are rare but include epigastric distress and one report of a posttraumatic deep venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>].</p><p>In summary, although SERMs may not result in complete regression of breast tissue, they may be effective for patients with painful gynecomastia. We suggest a three-month trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> for <strong>adolescents</strong> with severe breast enlargement that is confirmed to be glandular tissue and is causing substantial tenderness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> embarrassment. We suggest a similar approach for <strong>men</strong> prior to considering surgery. We typically choose tamoxifen over other SERMs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a>, since it is the best studied of the SERMs and is reasonably well tolerated. We evaluate patients after three months to determine if the therapy is effective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Aromatase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not suggest aromatase inhibitors for the prevention or treatment of gynecomastia. Aromatase inhibitors block estrogen biosynthesis and should theoretically be effective for gynecomastia by decreasing the estrogen-to-androgen ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, clinical trials to date have not demonstrated an important clinical benefit of these drugs for gynecomastia in either adolescents or men with prostate cancer. The reason for this is unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-causes-of-gynecomastia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and causes of gynecomastia&quot;, section on 'Imbalance between estrogen and androgen'</a> and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Men with prostate cancer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical therapy should be considered in men whose gynecomastia does not regress spontaneously, is causing considerable discomfort or psychological distress, or is long standing (greater than 12 months) <strong>and</strong> the fibrotic stage has been reached [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17</a>]. There was a 5 percent increase in gynecomastia surgery between 2014 and 2015, with over 27,000 male breast reduction surgeries being performed in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>For adolescents, surgery is generally not recommended until adult testicular size is attained, as there may be regrowth of the breast tissue if the surgery is performed before puberty is completed.</p><p>The extent of surgery depends upon the severity of the breast enlargement and whether there is also excess adipose tissue present. Multiple classification schemes have been published to grade the degree of gynecomastia. Men with moderate (6 to 11 cm in diameter) to severe gynecomastia (&gt;11 cm) are unlikely to undergo spontaneous regression. Surgical outcomes are generally better for those with minimal or moderate breast enlargement without skin redundancy than those with severe enlargement with stretched, redundant skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20245030\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients are treated with a combination of direct surgical excision of the glandular tissue and liposuction of any coexisting adipose tissue through a periareolar incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/5,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17,19</a>].</p><p>More extensive cosmetic surgery, including skin excision, is required for patients with marked gynecomastia or who develop excessive sagging of the breast tissue, as occurs with weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/17,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,21</a>]. A transverse ellipse of excessive skin, fat, and glandular tissue is excised, and the nipple-areola complex is removed as a full thickness graft and replaced in the appropriate anatomic position following removal of the redundant tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Alternatively, the nipple-areola complex may remain attached to the surrounding dermis and blood supply and be rotated upward into its proper position after the excessive tissue is excised.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20245036\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential complications of surgical therapy for gynecomastia include sloughing of tissue due to compromise of the blood supply, contour irregularity, hematoma or seroma formation, and numbness of the nipple-areolar area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/5,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19-23</a>]. However, when surgery is performed by an experienced cosmetic surgeon, complication rates are low, as illustrated in a series of 107 men with gynecomastia treated in one center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Only one patient had a postoperative complication (dehiscence of the surgical wound).

In a report of 3719 surgical procedures performed for gynecomastia (5113 breast specimens), the most common pathology diagnosis was gynecomastia (94.1 percent), followed by pseudogynecomastia (5.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The overall prevalence of invasive breast carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, and atypical ductal hyperplasia was 0.11, 0.18, and 0.4 percent, respectively (4, 7, and 18 cases, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Men with prostate cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gynecomastia is common in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation.

Much higher doses of antiandrogens are used for monotherapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicalutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bicalutamide</a> 150 versus 50 mg if combined with a GnRH agonist).

Strategies that have been used for prevention include pharmacologic therapy (SERMs [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>]) or radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gynecomastia/abstract/25,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29,30</a>].

When gynecomastia persists beyond 12 months, the breast glandular tissue has typically become fibrotic, and medical therapy is unlikely to be effective. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pubertal gynecomastia, a benign, physiologic process, typically develops between ages 10 and 12 years, with a peak prevalence of 65 percent between ages 13 and 14 years, followed by regression in approximately 80 percent within six months to two years. Its persistence into adulthood is uncommon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64368 \">figure 2</a>). Thus, observation without treatment is a reasonable approach in most adolescent boys.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most men with gynecomastia, we suggest initial observation without treatment with follow-up reevaluation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>), especially in men with drug-induced gynecomastia or men with an underlying treatable disorder such as hypogonadism or hyperthyroidism, once the drug has been stopped <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the underlying disorder has been treated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adolescent <strong>boys</strong> with severe breast enlargement that is confirmed to be glandular tissue and is causing substantial tenderness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> embarrassment, we suggest a brief trial (three months) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> (10 mg twice daily) for relief of tenderness (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

We currently use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> (10 mg twice daily) because there is inadequate experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a>.
