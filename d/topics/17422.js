For patients with hip pain due to a variety of conditions, THA can relieve pain, can restore function, and can improve quality of life. Sir John Charnley, a British orthopedic surgeon, developed the fundamental principles of the artificial hip and is credited as the father of THA. He designed a hip prosthesis in the mid to late 1960s that still sees use today. It is estimated that over 300,000 total hip arthroplasties are performed each year in the United States alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The normal hip functions as a &quot;ball-and-socket&quot; joint. The femoral head (ball) articulates with the acetabulum (socket), allowing smooth range of motion in multiple planes. Any condition that affects either of these structures can lead to deterioration of the joint. This, in turn, can lead to deformity, pain, and loss of function. The most common condition affecting the hip in this way is osteoarthritis. Other conditions that may affect the hip adversely include inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, etc), developmental dysplasia, childhood hip disorders (Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, etc), trauma, neoplasms, and osteonecrosis. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p>THA is a procedure whereby the diseased articular surfaces are replaced with synthetic materials, thus relieving pain and improving joint kinematics and function. Preoperative and operative issues related to THA are discussed in this topic review. Intraoperative and postoperative complications of THA are listed briefly below (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below) and are presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of total hip arthroplasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>THA is an elective procedure and should be considered as an option among other alternatives. The decision to proceed with THA is made with an understanding of the potential risks and benefits. A thorough understanding of both the procedure and the anticipated outcome is an important part of the decision-making process. For the appropriate candidate, THA can be a life-altering procedure that relieves pain, improves function, and enhances quality of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Published results of total hip arthroplasty (THA) demonstrate excellent clinical, functional, and radiographic results. These results vary depending upon the implant, the surgical technique, the type of fixation, the biomaterials, the patient's age, and a myriad of other factors. THA may be performed successfully in patients ranging from the very young [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>] to older adults (over 80 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, young and active patients must be made aware that premature failure of the replaced joint may occur if activity levels are not reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Impact activities, manual labor, heavy lifting, and high-intensity sports should be avoided.</p><p>In general, over 90 percent of THAs are working successfully, are pain-free, and are without complication 10 to 15 years postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some patients continue with their original implant even after 25 years of use. The rate of revision of THA is approximately 1 percent per year (that is, 1 percent of persons entering into a given year with a total hip replacement will have revision that year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is hoped that this service-life can be extended even further using contemporary surgical techniques and implants. In addition, patient satisfaction following the procedure is extremely high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential complications that can occur during and following total hip arthroplasty (THA) are discussed in detail separately, but several examples are listed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of total hip arthroplasty&quot;</a>.).</p><p>Intraoperative problems that may arise that are relatively specific to this type of surgery are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cement-related hypotension</p><p/><p>Postoperative complications include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dislocation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteolysis and wear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aseptic loosening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periprosthetic fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Implant failure or fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg length discrepancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heterotopic ossification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thromboembolic disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sequelae from metal-on-metal wear debris</p><p/><p>Other complications that may occur with any major surgery, such as those related to anesthesia, blood loss, or transfusion reactions, may also develop during or after joint arthroplasty and should be considered and discussed with the patient preoperatively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Post-operative mortality after total hip arthroplasty has fallen to low levels, with estimates citing a 30-day or 90-day mortality rate of less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reductions in mortality rates between 1991 and 2008 were shown in an analysis of over 1.4 million Medicare beneficiaries in the United States who underwent elective primary total hip arthroplasty during this period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The 30-day mortality decreased during this interval from 0.7 to 0.4 percent, despite a mean increase of one year in age and despite a mean increase from one to two in the number of comorbid medical conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective analysis from the United Kingdom assessed mortality within 90 days of hip replacement from 2003 to 2011, and included 409,096 primary hip replacements for osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. During the eight years of follow up, there was a significant decrease in mortality from 0.56 percent to 0.29 percent, even after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidity.</p><p/><p>A number of factors are associated with the risk of death after total hip arthroplasty. As an example, mortality rates are higher in patients who have THA in the setting of hip fracture management when compared with those who have elective surgery for other indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, improved survival has been noted in patients administered spinal anesthesia as well as mechanical or chemical thromboprophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is indicated in patients who have failed conservative or previous surgical treatment options for a deteriorated hip joint and who continue to have persistent, debilitating pain and a significant decrease in the activities of daily living. THA may also be indicated even in the absence of severe pain. Patients with significant deformity and limitation of motion may be candidates if the disability that results is considerable. Age itself is not a contraindication to proceeding with replacement. THA is indicated for patients of all ages (except the skeletally immature). Because the joint replacement can fail with time, the revision rate is lower if surgery is delayed as long as possible. A large population-based study including 63,158 patients aged 50 or older who had undergone a THA between 1991 and 2011 evaluated the lifetime risk for revision surgery based on patient age at the time of the initial procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The lifetime risk of revision increased with decreasing age, with the highest risk of 30 percent observed in men between the ages of 50 and 54. Thus, these data suggest that there may be some benefit to delaying surgery, particularly among younger men. However, newer bearing surface materials have led to a significant reduction in wear that should lead to a reduced risk of revision in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, patients who elect surgery at a better level of functional status have better functional outcomes. Surgeons and patients need to weigh carefully the relative advantages and drawbacks of earlier versus later THA for each patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total hip arthroplasty (THA) should <strong>not</strong> be undertaken in a number of clinical settings, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active infection (local or systemic)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preexisting significant medical problems (eg, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, or severe anemia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skeletal immaturity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraplegia or quadriplegia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Permanent or irreversible muscle weakness in the absence of pain</p><p/><p>Active infection is perhaps the most significant of these contraindications to THA. An infected THA can be a devastating and costly complication.</p><p>Relative contraindications include a neuropathic (Charcot) joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], inability to ambulate that is not related to the hip disorder per se, absence of hip abductor muscle mass, progressive neurologic loss, and morbid obesity. However, the effects of obesity on outcome remain uncertain. Most studies do show an increased risk of infection, particularly in the highly obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This must be weighed against the fact that some morbidly obese patients can have significant improvement postoperatively. A 2011 study from Canada noted that patients with morbid obesity can experience substantial benefit, despite a very small but statistically significant increase in the need for revision due to septic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other studies have emphasized the increased risk of both superficial and deep infections and have described an increased risk of dislocation in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Infection and other complications are discussed in detail elsewhere.

This is typically localized to the anterior hip or groin. Occasionally, posterior buttock pain may also be present. Pain typically occurs with hip motion but can be present at rest. The pain is often exacerbated by weightbearing and can radiate (commonly towards the knee). Patients frequently describe &quot;stiffness&quot; or &quot;tightness&quot; of the hip, and loss of motion is often noted. It is important to elicit any history of back pain, since hip pain may be the indirect result of radicular pathology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with hip pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Disruption of sleep and difficulty walking, climbing stairs, or getting into and out of a car are common complaints.

In general, it is appropriate to perform urinalysis prior to hip arthroplasty if a urinary catheter is expected to be in place postoperatively, and an abnormal urinalysis should prompt urine culture. The approach to treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in such patients is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria#H2424798\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with asymptomatic bacteriuria&quot;, section on 'Patients undergoing joint arthroplasty'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the preoperative evaluation reveals symptoms related to urinary obstruction, surgery should be postponed until the obstruction has been diagnosed and treated.

To diminish the risk of postoperative urinary tract infection, a bladder catheter should be inserted immediately preoperatively and should be removed within 24 hours of surgery. This decreases the risk of urinary retention, which has been shown to increase the likelihood of a postoperative urinary tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Continuation of NSAIDs prior to arthroplasty surgery has been shown to increase perioperative bleeding up to twofold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors &ndash; There is controversy as to whether or not selective COX-2 inhibitors significantly affect the coagulation system. No consensus exists regarding continuation of COX-2 inhibitors in the immediate preoperative or perioperative period; however, they are often used as part of a multimodal pain regimen.</p><p/><p>The literature provides conflicting evidence. In one prospective study, 100 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to receive rofecoxib or placebo. There was no significant difference in the incidence of perioperative bleeding or in the international normalized ratio (INR). Rofecoxib was withdrawn from the market in 2004 because of an increase in myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) and strokes in patients. It is not known if this is an effect that is shared by all COX-2 inhibitors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;, section on 'Ischemic cardiovascular disease'</a>.)</p><p>Other studies demonstrate an interaction between COX-2 inhibitors (predominantly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Interaction with warfarin appeared to be less of a problem with rofecoxib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], but this agent is no longer available. The risk of bleeding in systemically anticoagulated patients (as in most postoperative THA patients) appears to be lower with very or somewhat selective COX-2 inhibitors than with nonselective NSAIDs (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of selective COX-2 inhibitors&quot;</a>). Ultimately, whether or not to discontinue COX-2 inhibitors preoperatively is left to the discretion of the surgeon.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulation &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Warfarin</a> should be discontinued a minimum of three to five days prior to surgery. Preoperatively, the prothrombin time (PT) and corresponding INR should be normalized. For certain high-risk patients (eg, those with mechanical heart valves), heparin or low molecular weight (LMW) heparin may be required to minimize the amount of time spent off anticoagulation. If heparin is used, it should be stopped approximately six hours preoperatively, and normalized partial thromboplastin time (PTT) should be achieved before the operation begins. If LMW heparin is used, it should be stopped 24 hours preoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; As noted earlier, active infection is a contraindication to THA. Patients who have received treatment for an infection recently should be off the antibiotic for at least 48 hours preoperatively and should have no evidence of residual infection prior to proceeding with surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin and oral hypoglycemics &ndash; Most oral hypoglycemics should be held the day of surgery. Insulin dose should be reduced or held depending upon the patient's typical dose and upon the scheduled time for surgery (am or pm).

Based upon this and other evidence, it is recommended that statin therapy be continued up to and including the day of surgery.

Perioperatively, &quot;stress-dose&quot; glucocorticoids are often given to avoid the possible effects of adrenal insufficiency. The utility of this practice has been debated, but it continues to be practiced by many orthopedic surgeons and anesthesiologists. Typically, 100 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> is given intravenously within one hour before surgery and then every eight hours postoperatively. Half this dose is given the first postoperative day, and, subsequently, the regular oral dose of glucocorticoid is resumed.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-an-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: An overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many arthroplasty surgeons prefer to avoid anti-TNF agents in the perioperative period.

A more detailed description of hip anatomy, pain patterns, differential diagnosis, and physical examination of the hip, including special maneuvers, is available elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with hip pain&quot;</a>). Prior to surgery, the following evaluations are essential:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspection &ndash; Gait, previous incisions, abnormal swelling of hip or limb, abrasions, discolorations, and cutaneous infections should be evaluated by inspection. Gait assessment should include an evaluation of any limp, use of assistive devices, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limb length discrepancy. The presence or absence of a Trendelenburg gait should be noted. Any evidence of a &quot;minor&quot; infection (eg, infected ingrown toenail) should prompt a delay in surgery until the infection has completely resolved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpation &ndash; Anterior superior iliac spines, iliac crest, greater trochanter, posterior superior iliac spines, ischial tuberosity, and sacroiliac joint should be evaluated by palpation. Palpation can help rule out nonarticular causes of &quot;hip pain.&quot; For example, lateral hip pain localized over the greater trochanter is usually not an indicator of hip joint pathology but rather an inflammation of the greater trochanteric bursa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Range of motion &ndash; Hip <span class=\"nowrap\">flexion/extension,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">abduction/adduction,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">internal/external</span> rotation should be recorded. Contractures should be noted. Limitation of motion often develops as hip pathology progresses. Joint surface incongruity, muscle spasms, soft tissue contracture, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mechanical block (eg, osteophytes or loose bodies) may all contribute to decreased motion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle testing &ndash; Motor strength and tone should be evaluated for hip flexors, extensors, abductors, and adductors. In addition, distal motor strength and tone of the limb should be tested.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve and vascular status &ndash; Preoperatively, it is imperative to evaluate and document nerve and vascular status. Sciatic and peroneal nerve function testing, assessment of arterial pulses, and a thorough sensory examination should be performed and documented for both limbs. In addition, venous insufficiency should be noted. Severe vascular disease should be evaluated by a vascular surgeon prior to proceeding with surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Special tests</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg length &ndash; As part of preoperative planning, leg lengths must be evaluated. There are two types of leg length discrepancy. &quot;Apparent&quot; leg length discrepancy is the result of compensation in response to pathology or contracture rather than an actual difference in leg lengths (eg, presence of scoliosis or pelvic obliquity). True leg length discrepancy is the result of an anatomic or structural change in the lower limb (eg, tibia fracture). To measure true leg length, have the patient lie supine and place the lower limbs in comparable positions with the legs slightly apart and parallel. Next, use a tape measure to record the length between the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the medial malleolus for each limb. Another useful method of determining true leg length discrepancy is by using blocks of varying height. The patient is asked to stand, and blocks of varying height are placed under the short limb. When the iliac crests are at the same level, the block height represents a good approximation of the true leg length discrepancy. Typically, a deteriorated hip joint will cause a decrease in true leg length.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trendelenburg's sign &ndash; This test assesses the strength and function of the hip abductors. The sign is elicited by asking the patient to stand on the involved leg. Normally, the pelvis on the opposite side rises. However, if the pelvis on the opposite side drops, this test is positive. A positive test indicates that the hip abductors of the involved limb are weak or are relatively inhibited.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Straight leg raise &ndash; When this test is performed against resistance, groin pain is typically elicited if significant hip pathology is present. In addition, when this test is performed passively by the examiner, radiating pain from the back or posterior hip into the lower leg suggests a radicular pathology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Related areas &ndash; Particular attention to the spine, pelvis, and knees is essential to rule out radicular pathology as well as other concomitant diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Baseline laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, protime (PT), INR, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and basic chemistries. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and urinalysis are often performed. Urinary tract infection should be identified and treated with antibiotics prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Other laboratory tests can be ordered to assess pathologies found during the preoperative examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs of the hip and pelvis are essential for diagnosis and evaluation of hip disease, as well as preoperative planning for THA. Preoperative films should include a weightbearing anteroposterior (AP) pelvis, as well as AP and lateral views of the affected hip. Care should be taken to ensure that the entire proximal femur is visualized so that any deformity can be identified. In addition to plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary to evaluate certain hip disorders such as osteonecrosis. A discussion of imaging techniques and modalities for evaluation of hip pain is presented separately.

For patients with osteoarthritis, this usually includes nonoperative treatment measures, such as weight reduction, physical therapy, medications, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> use of an assistive device (eg, a cane). </p><p>In patients with hip involvement due to inflammatory arthritis (eg, rheumatoid arthritis or spondyloarthropathy), THA is offered to address the symptoms of advanced structural disease and not those of the underlying inflammatory disorder, which is treated medically.

The femoral head is drilled to remove necrotic debris and to potentially decrease pressure within the head. This procedure may be useful in early osteonecrosis but is not useful in the later stages (once collapse has occurred) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

By rotating the acetabulum, the hip biomechanics can be improved to provide a better bearing surface for the femoral head. This has been shown to delay or prevent the development of arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical dislocation and debridement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative evaluation and treatment of a variety of intracapsular hip disorders, including rheumatoid synovitis, synovial chondromatosis, pigmented villonodular synovitis, labral tears, chondral injury, impingement, previous trauma, and loose bodies, may be accomplished with surgical dislocation and debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Resection arthroplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resection arthroplasty, also called a Girdlestone procedure, consists of surgical removal of the femoral head and creation of a fibrous articulation between the proximal femur and the iliac bone. This is typically considered a salvage procedure. It is reserved for patients who have a chronic infection of the hip, certain bone tumors, or severe hip disease not amenable to other options. It can be a useful and important procedure to control infection, relieve pain, and restore hip motion. Leg length discrepancy, limp, hip instability, and early fatigue should be anticipated.

Total hip resurfacing involves resurfacing, rather than replacing, the damaged femoral head. Implants for this procedure were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006. These are metal-on-metal devices with a polished acetabular component and a mated metal head ball which caps the prepared femoral head.</p><p>The proposed advantages of this device include minimal bone resection, more normal femoral loading, restoration of natural anatomy, a large head size with reduced risk of dislocation, and the ability to revise to a standard total hip replacement should failure occur. The principal complication leading to failure of the device is femoral neck fracture, reasons for which are a subject of debate.</p><p>Although results from early studies appeared promising, concern has arisen over the long-term benefits and risks of metal-on-metal devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. An analysis of long-term data from several national registries found greater rates of re-revision following resurfacing compared with total hip arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. For example, the five-year cumulative revision rate in Australia was significantly greater following resurfacing (3.7 versus 2.7 percent). (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Bearing surface'</a> below.)</p><p>Patient selection and surgical technique seem to be the most important factors for success; young, active males under age 55 with osteoarthritis and minimal underlying hip deformity appear to be the best candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. The best results in females were in women with a femoral head component diameter of 50 mm or greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14257847\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemiarthroplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemiarthroplasties, a form of &quot;partial&quot; hip replacement, can be either unipolar (single head) or bipolar (head within a head). A bipolar hemiarthroplasty consists of a femoral stem and head ball (with no acetabular component). Hemiarthroplasties (such as a bipolar) are most often used in the setting of a femoral neck fracture in an older patient, but they are rarely used for degenerative hip disease. Historically, some surgeons used the procedure for the treatment of osteonecrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">BLOOD CONSERVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total hip arthroplasty may involve substantial intraoperative and perioperative blood loss (typically over 200 mL). This places some patients at increased risk for myocardial infarction, angina, claudication, transient ischemic attack, stroke, and seizure (especially in patients with significant systemic illness). Therefore, to maintain acceptable red cell indices, pharmacologic agents or transfusions can be used. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706218868\"><span class=\"h2\">Tranexamic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tranexamic acid</a> is emerging as the blood conservation method of choice for most patients. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that reduces blood loss, improves postoperative hemoglobin levels, and decreases transfusion rates in total hip and knee arthroplasties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. It is also easy to administer and is more cost-effective than most other blood conservation techniques. Furthermore, it has not been shown to increase adverse events such as thromboembolic complications, although studies of its use in patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis are not available. A large retrospective analysis of over 800,000 patients who underwent total hip or knee arthroplasty found that the use of tranexamic acid was associated with up to a 69 percent reduction in the need for allogeneic or autologous blood transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706218875\"><span class=\"h2\">Autologous blood donation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the 1980s, concerns over allogeneic blood infectivity prompted the establishment of autologous blood donation programs. Autologous blood donation helps to alleviate patient concerns about blood infectivity while also avoiding risks associated with allogeneic transfusion, decreasing the incidence of allogeneic transfusion, and stimulating erythropoiesis.</p><p>In the past, orthopedic surgeons at some institutions used preoperative autologous blood donation routinely for all patients undergoing joint replacement. However, this has fallen out of favor, especially with the availability and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, autologous blood donation has its own set of risks and drawbacks.

Most systems are modular with a separate femoral stem, femoral head, acetabular liner, and acetabular shell. This modularity gives the operating surgeon tremendous flexibility in dealing with any intraoperative situation or anatomical variation. There are a staggering number of femoral and acetabular implants available for use in THA. The multitude of choices reflects different philosophies regarding the type of fixation, design features, and materials.</p><p>Fixation of the prosthetic components to host bone can be achieved with one of two techniques. The first involves the use of cement, which serves as a grout between the implant and the host bone. The second technique achieves fixation without the use of cement and relies on bony ingrowth into or onto the porous implant surface which has been either &quot;press-fit&quot; or &quot;interference-fit&quot; into the surrounding bone. The uncemented approach was introduced in the 1980s and has proven to be a useful technique, providing secure and long-lasting fixation for THA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Implants</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Acetabular implant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there are many options for acetabular components in primary THA, the large majority of acetabular components inserted today are cementless, porous, and modular. Typically, a hemispherical porous metal shell is inserted into the acetabulum, and a modular liner is then placed within the shell. The acetabular liner, typically made of high-density polyethylene, is designed to articulate with a highly polished femoral head (ball). The porous surface of the implant varies from manufacturer to manufacturer and may have a surface coating (such as hydroxyapatite) that promotes bony ingrowth or overgrowth. Many designs allow for the insertion of screws for supplementary fixation of the shell.</p><p>The alternative to a cementless acetabular component is an acetabular component fixed to the acetabulum with cement. This type of acetabular implant has fallen out of favor due to studies showing a higher overall loosening rate than with uncemented implants. However, some surgeons advocate the use of an all-polyethylene cemented acetabular implant for older patients with poor bone stock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Bearing surface</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For years, the standard bearing surface has been a metallic femoral head, which articulated with a smooth, high-density polyethylene acetabular liner. Due to concerns about wear and resultant particle debris, alternate bearing surfaces have been developed. The most widely used of these is an acetabular liner made of highly crosslinked polyethylene, which has demonstrated superior wear characteristics when compared with standard polyethylene. Laboratory results using highly crosslinked polyethylene show a reduction in wear rates and particle debris when compared with ordinary high-density polyethylene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Clinical results also appear promising after 10 year follow-up, but longer term results are still needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Other alternative bearing surfaces used in the hip include ceramic-on-ceramic and metal-on-metal. While these have both demonstrated reduced wear as compared with standard metal-on-polyethylene, other potential complications have limited their widespread use. Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing surfaces have shown some catastrophic <span class=\"nowrap\">failures/breakages</span> as well as minor chips and cracks. With newer ceramic technology, this occurs much less frequently. Another complication of a ceramic-on-ceramic bearing surface is an audible squeak. Metal-on-metal bearing surfaces were introduced because they were thought to offer advantages over other materials, including a reduced need for revision. However, subsequent studies showed that metal-on-metal did not confer a clinical advantage over other bearing surfaces and resulted in higher rates of revision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/40,53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,53-56</a>]. The lack of evidence as a superior bearing surface along with the potentially toxic effects of cobalt and chromium ions in patients who received metal-on-metal implants has limited the use of these devices. Complications from metal-on-metal devices are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty#H21457382\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of total hip arthroplasty&quot;, section on 'Sequelae from metal-on-metal wearing debris'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h3\">Femoral implant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Femoral components can be classified as either cementless or cemented. Cemented femoral components were the gold standard until the late 1980s and early 1990s when published results of cementless implants demonstrated excellent results and durability.</p><p>A cementless femoral component is the implant of choice for the young patient and for any patient with good bone stock (particularly those with thick femoral cortices and with smaller diameter femoral canals). However, it is sometimes difficult to get good initial stability with a cementless implant in patients with large femoral canal geometry. In addition, a larger (and necessarily stiffer) implant would be required. Therefore, a cemented implant is an appropriate choice in the older, low-demand patient with poor bone stock (thin cortices and larger canal diameter).</p><p>Cementless implants are typically porous-coated to increase surface area for bone ingrowth. In addition, the roughened surface helps to achieve initial stability of the implant, which is critical for long-term success of the implant. The porous coating may be limited to the proximal portion of the femoral implant or may extend over the entire length of the implant. This varies depending upon the philosophy of the design. Proximally porous coated implants rely on the metaphysis or metadiaphyseal junction for fixation and stability. Extensively porous-coated implants rely more on diaphyseal fixation. Cementless implant designs utilize a circumferential porous coating, which has been shown to help prevent access of wear particles from the articulating surface down along the implant-bone interface.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h3\">Femoral head</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The femoral head in any THA must match the acetabular bearing surface. As mentioned above, different materials may be utilized for the bearing surface. However, most total hip arthroplasties performed today in the United States utilize a highly polished cobalt chrome femoral head. Different diameters are available ranging from 22 mm up to 38 mm (or greater). The key considerations regarding head size are range of motion, stability, and propensity for wear. In general, increasing head size is correlated with increased range of motion and decreased dislocation rate but also with increased volumetric wear and generation of particle debris. Therefore, a compromise must be made. The introductions of more durable acetabular liners (eg, highly crosslinked polyethylene) and alternative bearing surfaces are leading some surgeons to use a larger head size than the prior standard of 28 mm typically used in primary THA; the goal with the larger prosthetic head is to improve range of motion and to decrease the risk of dislocation. Long-term studies to evaluate this trend are not available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgical procedure for total hip arthroplasty (THA) has undergone an evolution since it was initially introduced, and a variety of surgical approaches to the hip have been described. Most are performed through a posterolateral, direct lateral, or anterior approach. &quot;Minimally invasive&quot; techniques have been developed and publicized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Posterolateral versus direct lateral versus anterior approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The posterolateral approach, also called the Kocher-Langenbeck approach, gains exposure to the hip by splitting the gluteus maximus muscle and dissecting off the short external rotators on the posterior aspect of the hip. The joint is entered posteriorly through the capsule. The hip abductor muscles (gluteus medius and minimus) are left intact.</p><p>The direct lateral approach, also called the Hardinge or modified Hardinge approach, gains exposure to the hip by splitting the anterior portion of the abductors. This provides access to the hip through the anterior hip capsule. Typically, these approaches are performed with the patient in the lateral position. However, the direct lateral approach may be performed with the patient supine or semilateral.</p><p>The anterior approach, also called the Smith-Petersen or Hueter approach, gains exposure to the hip without detachment of the surrounding muscles. An interval is created between the tensor fascia and the sartorius. Access to the hip is provided through the anterior hip capsule. This approach is performed with the patient supine, often using a special operative table and the assistance of fluoroscopy.</p><p>These surgical approaches provide excellent exposure of the hip joint and allow access to the acetabulum and femur for THA. The posterolateral approach disrupts the posterior soft tissue of the hip and historically has shown a higher rate of dislocation than the direct lateral approach. However, the direct lateral approach has demonstrated a higher risk of postoperative limp and heterotopic ossification secondary to disruption of the abductors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p>The anterior approach is thought to have an even lower dislocation rate because the muscles around the hip are not detached during the procedure. Many surgeons who use the anterior approach tell their patients that dislocation precautions are not required for this approach. Potential complications include intraoperative femoral and ankle fractures and damage to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. There is some preliminary evidence that demonstrates a more rapid early recovery with this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], but more prospective, randomized studies are needed.</p><p>These factors should be taken into consideration when choosing a surgical approach for a patient, but they do not preclude the use of the approach with which the surgeon is most comfortable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimally invasive versus standard techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimally invasive THA has been of increased interest to both patients and surgeons. Using the standard surgical approaches described above, the incision for THA has traditionally been about 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 inches) in length. This varies depending upon the patient's weight, height, morphology, and particular hip anatomy.</p><p>Using minimally invasive techniques, the standard incision for THA may be reduced to 10 cm (4 inches) or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/60-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-63</a>]. A two-incision approach using even smaller incisions has also been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This two-incision technique is a novel approach to THA and requires the use of fluoroscopy and special training of the surgeon. It should be noted that regardless of which approach is used (standard, single-incision mini, or two-incision mini), the total hip joint implants inserted are the same.</p><p>The proposed advantages of using a smaller incision (or two minimal incisions) are the potential for decreased blood loss, decreased surgical time, less surgical trauma, quicker rehabilitation, shorter hospital stay, and reduced costs. Initial reports confirmed these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/60-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-64</a>], with complications comparable to those encountered via a standard incision. However, a subsequent comparison of 42 primary procedures through a standard incision with 42 primary total hip arthroplasties performed though a single mini-incision did not demonstrate any significant differences in blood loss or length of hospital stay, nor did the comparison demonstrate any difference in complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The conclusion was that the only difference was cosmetic.</p><p>Potential disadvantages of operating through one or two minimal incisions include limited visualization, component malposition, increased skin trauma, and difficulty determining leg lengths. There are no long-term studies to critically evaluate the minimally invasive procedure, and long-term durability remains to be seen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical navigation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical navigation in THA is also being developed. Navigation involves real-time tracking of bones and surgical instruments during surgery. The potential benefits of navigation in THA are improved accuracy of implant position (particularly the acetabular component) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>] and smaller incisions because direct visualization is not necessary. The disadvantages of navigation systems are increased operative time, the need for image acquisition preoperatively or intraoperatively, and increased expense. Again, long-term studies are not available to compare results of THA with and without surgical navigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1251006876\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHESIA FOR TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total hip arthroplasty (THA) may be performed with general anesthesia (GA) or neuraxial anesthesia (NA) (ie, spinal, epidural, or combined spinal epidural [CSE]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-anesthesia-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal anesthesia: Technique&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidural and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia: Techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3292856973\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of anesthetic technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of anesthetic technique should be based on patient comorbidities and patient choice. The literature comparing GA with NA for THA is inconclusive for a number of patient-important outcomes. A meta-analysis of 29 observational and randomized studies (approximately 10,500 patients) that compared GA with NA for THA or total knee arthroplasty reported no differences in mortality, chest infection, or thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Length of hospital stay was reduced with NA (weighted mean difference -0.4 days [-0.76 to -0.03]). Blood loss and transfusion were not evaluated because of the low quality of studies.</p><p>In practice, many patients receive some elements of both types of anesthesia. During NA, most patients receive heavy sedation, and patients who receive GA for THA may also have epidural analgesia for postoperative pain control.</p><p>Single injection spinal is a commonly used NA technique for uncomplicated primary THA. Epidural or CSE are used for procedures that are expected to last more than approximately two hours and if postoperative epidural analgesia is planned. While most anticoagulants (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) are held preoperatively, caution must be used with NA in the setting of preoperative anticoagulation. Careful attention to the half-life of the specific anticoagulant should be taken into account. In addition, the plan for postoperative anticoagulation should be discussed with the surgeon before finalizing plans for regional anesthesia techniques. Epidural analgesia may require coordination with administration of heparin or other anticoagulants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuraxial anesthesia/analgesia techniques in the patient receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication&quot;</a>.)</p><p>GA is used for patients with contraindications to NA and for some patients with potential difficulty with airway management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H717871222\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Creation of a strategy for airway management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H550126190\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use a multimodal strategy for postoperative pain control after THA that may include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, and regional anesthesia techniques to reduce the need for opioids.

Therefore, no single nerve block can be used to provide complete analgesia after THA. Lumbar plexus block may provide adequate postoperative analgesia after THA but can be technically challenging and carries risks including neuraxial spread of local anesthetic, neuraxial hematoma, and retroperitoneal hematoma. It can be considered as part of a multimodal pain control strategy for patients with chronic pain, opioid tolerance, or sensitivity to opioids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques#H1413150725\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity nerve blocks: Techniques&quot;, section on 'Lumbar plexus (psoas compartment) block'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446375011\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical hospital length of stay following total hip arthroplasty is one to two days. However, there are some reports of performing this procedure as an outpatient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>Mobilization and physical therapy are initiated as soon as possible to facilitate recovery of function and to help prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Rapid recovery protocols are becoming more widespread. Exercises to restore normal hip motion and strength and a gradual return to everyday activities are initiated in the hospital and continued upon discharge. This may involve 20 to 30 minutes of exercises two or three times daily during early recovery. Typically, weightbearing as tolerated is allowed, and an assistive device is used to help with balance and stability. Walking aids are weaned as strength, balance, and comfort improve. Depending on the surgical approach and surgeon's protocol, some patients may need to follow certain dislocation precautions. Some surgeons may also recommend formal outpatient therapy, but this is often individualized based on the surgeon's preferences and the patient's needs.</p><p>Appropriate attention to medical comorbidities such as diabetes is critical. Medical consultation may be needed for medically complex patients. Multimodal pain management is employed and usually includes an opioid for the treatment of pain. Pain medications are weaned as soon as pain allows but may be needed for a number of weeks postoperatively. DVT prophylaxis is also used and includes chemical prophylaxis as well as mechanical prophylaxis (eg, sequential compression boots). A detailed discussion of the prevention of thromboembolic disease in surgical patients is presented separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;, section on 'Special groups'</a>).</p><p>Many patients can be discharged to home after surgery, but some may require an inpatient rehabilitation or nursing facility. Time to full recovery varies widely, but patients are typically doing quite well with minimal pain by three months postoperatively. There may be further improvement noted even up to one year following surgery. Most patients may resume regular, non-impact activities such as walking, stair-climbing, swimming, golf, light tennis, and biking. These activities can be resumed once comfort and strength allows. Running, jogging, heavy lifting, and high-impact activities are not typically recommended. Other activities such as yoga and Pilates may be allowed if care is taken to avoid extremes in range of motion to avoid dislocation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

The 30-day mortality rate of THA is less than 1 percent, although a variety of complications may occur during and following the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of total hip arthroplasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>THA is indicated in patients who have failed conservative or previous surgical treatment options for a deteriorated hip joint and who continue to have persistent, debilitating pain and a significant decrease in the activities of daily living. Some patients with significant disability, deformity, and limited motion may also benefit, even in the absence of severe pain. Contraindications to THA include active infection (local or systemic), preexisting significant medical problems, skeletal immaturity, paraplegia, quadriplegia; and permanent or irreversible muscle weakness in the absence of pain. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A careful preoperative evaluation is essential to help diagnose hip pathology, identify appropriate surgical candidates, assist with surgical planning, and minimize perioperative and postoperative complications. Key elements of the preoperative evaluation include history, physical examination, laboratory testing, imaging studies, review of treatment alternatives, evaluation of comorbidities, consideration of alternatives to THA, consideration of blood conservation, and selection of prosthetic components. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before proceeding to THA, a more conservative approach should be tried, which, depending upon the underlying condition, may include nonoperative treatment measures such as weight reduction, physical therapy, and medications or medication adjustments. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Conservative treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential surgical alternatives to THA depend upon the etiology of the hip deterioration; they include core decompression, intertrochanteric osteotomy, periacetabular osteotomy, surgical dislocation and debridement, resection arthroplasty, hip arthroscopy, hip arthrodesis, and total hip resurfacing. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives to total hip arthroplasty'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>THA may involve substantial intraoperative and perioperative blood loss (typically over 200 mL), which may increase risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ischemic events. A number of blood conservation strategies are available, including use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a>, preoperative autologous blood donation, and use of erythropoietin. Each of these approaches has its own set of benefits, risks, and drawbacks. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Blood conservation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total hip arthroplasties consist of a femoral component, an acetabular component, and a bearing surface. Most systems are modular, providing flexibility in dealing with any intraoperative situation or anatomical variation. Numerous different femoral and acetabular implants are available, reflecting different philosophies regarding the type of fixation, design features, and materials. Fixation of the prosthetic components to host bone is achieved either by the use of cement or by an uncemented approach. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Choice of prosthesis and fixation technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of surgical approaches to the hip have been described. Most are performed through a posterolateral, a direct lateral, or an anterior approach. Minimally invasive THA and more rapid recovery protocols have been of increased interest to both patients and surgeons, but whether these offer greater benefit overall remains uncertain.
