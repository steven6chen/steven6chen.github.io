However, the risk profile differs when synthetic mesh is used to treat SUI compared with pelvic organ prolapse.

With regard to mesh for SUI surgery, the FDA stated in its prior 2016 notification that &quot;The safety and effectiveness of multi-incision slings is well established in clinical trials that followed patients for up to one year.
