All stages of the hemostatic process may be abnormal, including primary hemostasis (platelet adhesion and activation), coagulation (generation and crosslinking of fibrin), and fibrinolysis (clot dissolution) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Patients with severe liver disease and abnormalities of coagulation testing should not be assumed to be &quot;auto-anticoagulated,&quot; because standard coagulation testing does not assess prothrombotic and fibrinolytic changes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H61498758\" class=\"local\">'Prothrombotic changes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H61501315\" class=\"local\">'Increased fibrinolysis'</a> below.)</p><p>Factors that contribute to increased risks of both bleeding and thrombosis include altered blood flow, diminished numbers and function of platelets, and inflammatory alterations in endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/1,3-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-14</a>]. These changes may result in a relatively balanced steady state in some patients, but it is generally accepted that susceptibility to bleeding and thrombosis both may be increased, with the relative balance or imbalance different for each patient. The risks of bleeding and thrombosis are not reflected in the conventional indices of coagulation status such as the prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Of interest, elevation of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and the ratio of factor VIII to protein C carry independent prognostic importance in patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Notable exceptions are factor VIII, which is produced in endothelial cells, and the factor XIII A-subunit, which is produced in the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>]. In addition to synthesizing coagulation proteins, hepatocytes also make post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and gamma-carboxylation of some factors. Both synthesis and post-translational modification may be impaired in liver disease, affecting coagulation factor abundance and function, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin K and the synthesis and function of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some patients with liver disease, particularly those actively using alcohol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a> deficiency can further exacerbate deficiencies of vitamin K-dependent factors (II [prothrombin], VII, IX, and X) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lead to improper modifications (eg, under-gamma carboxylation of prothrombin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Dysfibrinogenemia may also contribute to the bleeding risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61501309\"><span class=\"h3\">Thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with liver disease may have normal platelet counts (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;150,000/microL)</span> or varying degrees of thrombocytopenia. Mild thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet count between 100,000 and <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL)</span> has been reported in up to 75 percent of patients with chronic liver disease, and moderate thrombocytopenia (eg, between 50,000 and <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL)</span> has been reported in approximately 13 percent of individuals with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17</a>]. The correlation between platelet count and clinical bleeding is weak, especially for counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;50,000/microL</span>.</p><p>The mechanism of thrombocytopenia in liver disease may include impaired platelet production, from decreased hepatic synthesis of thrombopoietin; bone marrow suppression, from hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or alcohol use, other infection, or antiviral or antibiotic therapy; and increased platelet sequestration in the spleen, in the setting of portal hypertension and hypersplenism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular endothelial function and fundamental mechanisms of fibrinolysis (thrombolysis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The overall incidence of infection in patients with liver disease has been estimated to be as high as 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Overt sepsis or low levels of endotoxemia can impair platelet function in patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, infection has been associated with increases in endogenous glycosaminoglycans known as heparinoids (eg, heparan sulphate, dermatan sulphate), which can act as anticoagulants; these increases may result from changes in nitric oxide metabolism or other endothelial changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61501315\"><span class=\"h3\">Increased fibrinolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrinolysis (dissolution of the fibrin clot) is often increased in liver disease. Evidence of systemic fibrinolysis can be detected in 30 to 46 percent of patients with chronic liver disease and parallels the degree of liver dysfunction. However, clinically evident hyperfibrinolysis is less common and has been estimated to occur in 5 to 10 percent of those with decompensated cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Hyperfibrinolysis promotes premature clot dissolution and interferes with clot formation due to the consumption of clotting factors.</p><p>Hyperfibrinolysis overlaps with a condition in cirrhosis that resembles disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), called &quot;accelerated intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis (AICF),&quot; but it can be evident as a distinct clinical entity with intractable bleeding following puncture wounds or dental extractions, or on occasion without any recognizable trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, the lack of a commonly available means to clearly identify this condition (such as via the use of thromboelastography and thromboelastometry) impedes the evaluation of hyperfibrinolysis in patients with cirrhosis. Even with these global tests of clot formation and dissolution, widely accepted criteria for milder cases of hyperfibrinolysis are not yet established.</p><p>Hepatocytes and Kupffer cells are also responsible for clearing coagulation factors and products of fibrinolysis from the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Liver disease may contribute to a prothrombotic state because these natural inhibitors may be reduced.</p><p>Liver disease may also be associated with increases in acute phase reactants, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and decreased levels of the VWF-cleaving protease ADAMTS13, as well as inflammatory changes in endothelial cells that promote thrombosis.

However, these tests are very poor at predicting the risk of bleeding in individuals with liver disease because they only reflect changes in procoagulant factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>If accurate testing of hemostasis is required, it might be more helpful to use comprehensive viscoelastic testing such as thromboelastography (TEG) or thromboelastometry (ROTEM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. TEG and ROTEM both produce a tracing that reflects dynamic changes in clot formation and lysis, assessed from the changes in torque between a pin and a cup that occur as blood clots; parameters of clot formation time and firmness can be read from the tracing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100078 \">figure 1</a>). In TEG, the cup rotates and the pin is stationary; in ROTEM, the pin rotates and the cup is stationary. Further information about parameters and interpretation of viscoelastic testing is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-function-testing#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet function testing&quot;, section on 'Thromboelastography (TEG)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma#H3046566855\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coagulopathy associated with trauma&quot;, section on 'Thromboelastography'</a>.)</p><p>In general, studies of TEG and ROTEM in patients with liver disease have shown decreased use of blood products due to the ability of these devices to confirm relatively preserved hemostatic function despite a prolonged INR. However, evidence for the value of viscoelastic testing in liver disease remains limited. A small study comparing ROTEM parameters in blood samples from 51 patients with cirrhosis found that the parameters most likely to be abnormal in cirrhosis were the clot formation time and the maximum clot firmness; in contrast, the coagulation time was normal in more than half of the samples from cirrhotic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Additional small studies suggest that viscoelastic testing may be able to predict hypercoagulability in liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/7,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,34</a>].</p><p>In most patients, we do not intervene in the setting of asymptomatic laboratory changes (eg, elevations in the <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> or aPTT, decreases in the platelet count) that are thought to be due to the underlying liver disease. An exception is that we give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a> to patients with suspected deficiency, including any patients with suspected poor nutrition and cirrhosis, as well as those with cholestatic disease, diarrheal illness, or antibiotic use. There is little evidence regarding the efficacy of administering vitamin K; however, toxicities are also negligible. A typical dose of vitamin K in this setting is 10 mg orally per day for three days, or 10 mg intravenously as a single dose for individuals who cannot take vitamin K orally or who may not adequately absorb vitamin K (eg, ascites, gut edema). The intravenous infusion should be given slowly (ie, no faster than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/minute)</span> to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis.</p><p>We do not administer Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) to &quot;correct&quot; an asymptomatic prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR,</span> based on a large number of possible risks and costs of this approach (eg, transfusion reactions, volume overload, increased portal pressures) and the lack of good quality evidence that it provides any clinically important benefit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-plasma-components#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of plasma components&quot;, section on 'Risks'</a>.)</p><p>We also do not routinely utilize the bleeding time as a risk measure, although past studies have reported this as being prolonged in many patients with cirrhosis. The utility of the bleeding time as a measure of bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis has not been established.</p><p>Cases that require further investigation or in which we may intervene include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large or unexpected changes such as newly prolonged PT or aPTT or new decline in platelet count may require evaluation for the cause, which may include infection, new medication(s), or portal vein thrombosis (PVT), or progression of the underlying liver disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL),</span> which can be associated with severe hypersplenism, medication reaction, or complications such as PVT, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in patients receiving heparin.

The use of thrombopoietin receptor agonists in this setting (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eltrombopag-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eltrombopag</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=romiplostim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">romiplostim</a>) is discussed separately, including potential benefits (eg, ability to tolerate anti-HCV therapy) and thrombotic risks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-applications-of-thrombopoietic-growth-factors#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical applications of thrombopoietic growth factors&quot;, section on 'Liver disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the need for an invasive procedure may require more aggressive correction of hemostatic defects, although this should be based on a thorough clinical assessment rather than isolated laboratory testing such as the <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR,</span> which does not provide a full picture of hemostasis in patients with liver disease. (See <a href=\"#H61498824\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding'</a> below and <a href=\"#H166552210\" class=\"local\">'Invasive procedure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61498800\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver disease versus DIC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defects in the synthesis of pro- and anticoagulant factors predominate in liver disease; these are grouped under the term &quot;accelerated intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis (AICF)&quot; (see <a href=\"#H61498752\" class=\"local\">'Impaired hemostasis'</a> above). In contrast, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is caused by ongoing intravascular thrombin generation with coagulation factor consumption.

Clinical judgement plays a major role in determining the presence of DIC in a patient with liver disease. It also may be possible to use some laboratory features to help clarify the overall picture. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor VIII levels generally are increased or normal in liver disease because factor VIII is produced in endothelial cells rather than the liver. In DIC, factor VIII levels generally are low.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D-dimer levels generally are normal or mildly elevated in liver disease. D-dimer may be dramatically increased in DIC because DIC results in more profound fibrinolysis. However, significant overlap exists.</p><p/><p>Importantly, liver disease and DIC may coexist because individuals with liver disease often have comorbidities that place them at increased risk for developing DIC, especially in the setting of <span class=\"nowrap\">infection/sepsis</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malignancy.

We generally err on the side of giving vitamin K if we are unsure of the status. As noted above (see <a href=\"#H61498782\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory abnormalities'</a> above), there is little evidence regarding the efficacy of administering vitamin K, but toxicities are also negligible. A typical dose of vitamin K in a bleeding patient is 10 mg by slow intravenous infusion (ie, no faster than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/minute)</span>.

However, these agents may be appropriately used on a case-by-case basis if bleeding continues despite other interventions. Results of trials evaluating PCCs in patients with cirrhosis-associated bleeding (such as the PROTON trial) are eagerly awaited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We also generally avoid giving FFP due to the large volume load and potential adverse effect on portal pressures.

Although abnormal coagulation testing is especially concerning in the setting of varices, the major cause of variceal bleeding is thought to be local vascular deformations and hemodynamic changes (eg, increased portal pressure) rather than a bleeding diathesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Hemostatic mechanisms appear to play only a transient role as evident in the unstable &quot;platelet plug&quot; or nipple sign, which is sometimes evident at the point of varix breach. Thus, the most important interventions for prevention and treatment of bleeding involve reducing portal pressure and ligating bleeding lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-the-management-of-variceal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of the management of variceal hemorrhage&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with active bleeding despite these interventions, the use of prohemostatic agents may be appropriate as rescue agents. However, potential benefits must be weighed against risks such as increased portal pressure with plasma transfusions and increased thrombotic risk with coagulation factor concentrates. We are unaware of studies that have adequately evaluated rFVIIa or PCC in uncontrollable hemorrhage, although they have occasionally been used to try to temporize an unstable situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H166552210\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive procedure</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233835828\"><span class=\"h3\">General approach to invasive procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little evidence to support the practice of administering FFP to &quot;correct&quot; the <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> prior to performing an invasive procedure. Trials that show a clinical benefit are lacking, and the underpinnings of INR as a target and measure of bleeding risk (outside of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy) do not apply to patients with cirrhotic coagulopathy, which has a completely different pathophysiology than that seen in warfarin anticoagulation.</p><p>Our general practice is to optimize renal status and treat comorbidities such as infections, as done for patients with bleeding (see <a href=\"#H61498824\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding'</a> above). We rely on global measures of clot formation if available, or fibrinogen and platelet count if not. We avoid engorgement of the collateral bed as much as possible by limiting volume expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Because of the mucosal engorgement of the capillary bed in the tributaries of the portal venous system, we sometimes use an infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> just before interventions such as biliary sphincterotomy and high-risk polypectomy. In such cases, we use 50 mcg as a single bolus, without an infusion. This is based on our clinical experience; high-quality evidence regarding the optimal dose is lacking. A slow and methodical approach to breaches of the gut mucosa may decrease the risk of bleeding.</p><p>The value of using a measure of global clot formation to guide blood product use was demonstrated in a trial that randomly assigned 60 patients with cirrhosis who were undergoing an invasive procedure to be managed using thromboelastography (TEG) or according to standard hospital protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Patients assigned to the TEG arm received FFP if the reaction time (r) was &gt;40 minutes (normal range for this study, 12 to 26 minutes) and platelets if the maximum amplitude (MA) was &lt;30 mm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100078 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74954\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74954 \">table 3</a>). Those assigned to standard protocol received FFP for INR &gt;1.8 and platelets for a count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL</span>. The overall use of blood products was lower in the TEG group (17 versus 100 percent). There was no bleeding in the TEG group and one episode of bleeding in the control group (hemoperitoneum following large-volume paracentesis). This study highlights the difficulty in assessing need for prophylactic therapy without a standardized and accurate measure of in vivo hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In general, platelet counts between 50,000 and 100,000 are associated with improved thrombin production and provide a rational target together with adequate thrombin substrate (fibrinogen). Platelet count thresholds for various invasive procedures are described separately.

Rather, we use the INR as a prognostic measure (eg, in calculating the Model for End-stage Liver Disease [MELD] score) rather than a means of bleeding risk assessment. Prolongation of the INR probably does reflect instability of the hemostatic balance, but it doesn&rsquo;t indicate hypo- or hypercoagulability in cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-plasma-components#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of plasma components&quot;, section on 'Minimally elevated INR'</a>.)</p><p>Additional risks and disadvantages of giving FFP include transfusion reactions, volume overload (and associated increases in portal pressure, especially in individuals with varices), and infection.

In addition to addressing treatable comorbidities that may affect hemostasis, we use the following procedure-specific interventions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liver biopsy</strong> &ndash; Liver biopsy, although less utilized for staging fibrosis, remains an essential diagnostic tool in many conditions. It always raises concerns about bleeding, especially in patients with suspected coagulopathy and low platelets, and even more so in those with added risks such as renal insufficiency or increased risk of volume overload. However, a review of 200 patients in whom &quot;liver bleeding time&quot; was evaluated at the time of liver biopsy found that there was no correlation between the degree of bleeding and any measure of hemostasis tested (eg, PT, platelet count, whole blood clotting time) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to addressing comorbidities, our approach generally includes using platelet transfusions to increase the platelet count to <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;50,000/microL,</span> especially if there is known history of easy bruising or bleeding; transfusing Cryoprecipitate to raise the fibrinogen to &gt;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> and optimizing renal function. Transvenous biopsy is an alternative approach in particularly high-risk patients, although the quality of specimens is sometimes limiting and overall complication rates are similar to percutaneous biopsy, albeit usually in a higher risk population. Our practice is consistent with guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, which suggests an individualized approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thoracentesis</strong> &ndash; Thoracentesis may be slightly more dangerous than paracentesis. Our approach is similar to that in liver biopsy and includes addressing comorbidities, using platelet transfusions to increase the platelet count to <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;50,000/microL,</span> transfusing Cryoprecipitate to raise the fibrinogen level to &gt;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> optimizing renal function, and controlling infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dental extractions</strong> &ndash; In addition to addressing comorbidities, we often use intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (DDAVP) for patients undergoing dental extractions, especially when there is time to plan ahead and arrange for the DDAVP to be given to the patient in the dental clinic. This is based on findings from a trial that randomly assigned 43 patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation who had an INR 2.0 to 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;50,000/microL</span> to receive intranasal DDAVP (300 mcg) or transfusions (FFP, 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> one unit of single donor platelets, based on INR and platelet count) prior to the dental procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Hemostasis was similar in the two groups, and adverse effects were less with DDAVP (no major events versus one bleeding and one allergic reaction in the transfusion group). We sometimes recommend a similar approach in dental extractions and thoracentesis.</p><p/><p>Use of global assays such as TEG or ROTEM often can reassure operators in these moderate risk procedures. Of note, we do <strong>not</strong> administer FFP routinely prior to performing liver biopsy or other minor procedures in individuals with liver disease, regardless of laboratory values.

In most cases, we do not use preprocedure prophylaxis, which is consistent with guidelines in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]; practices in other countries vary. The exceptions to this general approach are patients who have bled before with paracentesis or who have known or suspected hyperfibrinolysis or some other overtly evident bleeding diathesis such as mucosal bleeding or past bleeding with puncture wounds. With proper <span class=\"nowrap\">needle/cannula</span> placement, bleeding in this situation is usually venous from the collateral bed of the abdominal wall venous system. Thus, avoiding engorgement of the collateral bed (as with plasma transfusions) is again of significant importance to minimize bleeding risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1163324001\"><span class=\"h3\">Palliative drain placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some situations involving terminal care of a patient with cirrhosis, indwelling drains may be used to better control refractory ascites. In these situations, which are often accompanied by a degree of renal failure, prophylactic therapy may be warranted especially if a tunneled catheter is to be placed due to increased risk of trauma to the portal venous collateral bed of the abdominal wall. In these cases, we would recommend similar measures as outlined above for liver biopsy or dental extractions. (See <a href=\"#H166552254\" class=\"local\">'Liver biopsy/thoracentesis/dental extractions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H166552260\"><span class=\"h3\">Major surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interventions for patients who require major surgery, including liver transplant, must be individualized. Increasingly, global measures of hemostasis such as TEG and ROTEM are being utilized by the anesthesiologist to guide optimal hemostatic measures. In the absence of these tests, we would recommend a similar approach as outlined above, which includes optimizing the platelet count, fibrinogen level, and renal function; and avoiding the use of INR values to guide therapy. (See <a href=\"#H233835367\" class=\"local\">'General approach to managing bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p>As with all procedures, avoidance of volume expanding the portal collateral circulation is essential to optimize safety. In some cases, especially when there are abundant collaterals in the operative field (such as colon resection or uterine resection), preoperative transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may be appropriate in selected patients to decrease flow in portal collaterals, although we are unaware of controlled trials to test the efficacy of this approach.

VTE prophylaxis is appropriate for the majority of hospitalized medical and surgical patients with liver disease, similar to individuals hospitalized with other acute conditions. Therapy for VTE may be complicated by concerns about bleeding, difficulty monitoring the degree of anticoagulation, and lack of evidence to support a specific anticoagulant, dose, or duration of therapy. We individualize anticoagulant therapy in collaboration between hepatologists and hematologists.
