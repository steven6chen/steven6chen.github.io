The presenting signs and symptoms are nonspecific; no single symptom or sign is pathognomonic for pneumonia in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Symptoms and signs of pneumonia may be subtle, particularly in infants and young children. The combination of fever and cough is suggestive of pneumonia; other respiratory findings (eg, tachypnea, increased work of breathing) may precede the cough. Cough may not be a feature initially since the alveoli have few cough receptors. Cough begins when the products of infection irritate cough receptors in the airways. The longer fever, cough, and respiratory findings are present, the greater the likelihood of pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Neonates and young infants may present with difficulty feeding, restlessness, or fussiness rather than with cough <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormal breath sounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Neonates, young infants, and young children (ie, &lt;5 to 10 years of age) may present only with fever and leukocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].</p><p>Older children and adolescents may complain of pleuritic chest pain (pain with respiration), but this is an inconsistent finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Occasionally, the predominant manifestation may be abdominal pain (because of referred pain from the lower lobes) or nuchal rigidity (because of referred pain from the upper lobes). &quot;Walking pneumonia&quot; is a term that is sometimes used to describe pneumonia in which the respiratory symptoms do not interfere with normal activity.</p><p>In a multicenter population-based study that included 2358 children &lt;18 years hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia, 95 percent had cough, 90 percent had fever, 75 percent had anorexia, 70 percent had dyspnea, and 55 percent had chest indrawing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of the child with cough and potential lower respiratory tract disease has three goals: the identification of the clinical syndrome (eg, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, asthma), consideration of the etiologic agent (eg, bacteria, virus), and an assessment of the severity of the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

However, it is nonspecific and variably present. Young infants may have afebrile pneumonia related to <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> or other pathogens. Fever tends to be lower grade in children with bronchiolitis than in children with pneumonia and typically is absent in children with asthma.

Respiratory distress is moderate to severe; auscultatory findings may be few and focal, limited to the involved anatomic segment. Signs and symptoms of sepsis and localized chest pain (signifying pleural irritation) are more suggestive of bacterial etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], as they are rarely present in nonbacterial pneumonia.
