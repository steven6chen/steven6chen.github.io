Meralgia paresthetica is the term used to describe the clinical syndrome of pain, dysesthesia, or both in the anterolateral thigh associated with compression of the nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with hip pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of meralgia paresthetica cases result from entrapment of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve as it passes under the inguinal ligament. The most frequent associated conditions are obesity, diabetes mellitus, and older age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Additional associations include large abdomens with overlying panniculus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], tight belts or garments around the waist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>], scar tissue near the lateral aspect of the inguinal ligament, and pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>Injury during local or regional surgery (eg, spine procedures, iliac crest bone harvesting, hip prosthesis, aorto-bifemoral bypass) is another important cause of meralgia paresthetica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], accounting for 17 percent of cases in one series of 120 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Seat belt injury following motor vehicle accident is a less frequent cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Meralgia has also been reported after long-distance walking and cycling, possibly as a consequence of local ischemia during repetitive muscle stretching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective population-based study from Minnesota, 262 patients with meralgia paresthetica were compared with 262 normal controls and 262 body mass index-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The following observations were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The adjusted incidence of meralgia paresthetica in people with diabetes mellitus was seven-fold greater than that of the general population (247 versus 33 per 100,000 population)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among subjects with both meralgia paresthetica and diabetes, most developed diabetes after the diagnosis of meralgia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with meralgia were significantly more likely to have diabetes than controls matched for body mass index (odds ratio 2, 95% CI 1.3-3.0)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean body mass index of patients with meralgia was significantly greater than that of matched controls (30.1 versus 27.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m2)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean age at meralgia paresthetica diagnosis was 50 years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence rates of meralgia paresthetica were similar for men and women</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The course of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is under the inguinal ligament in the majority of patients. However, in a small percentage of cases the nerve enters the thigh lateral to the anterior superior iliac spine or in an extremely medial position near the insertion of the inguinal ligament on the pubis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This is important from the standpoint of local injection. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Nerve blockade'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burning pain, paresthesia (numbness and tingling), and hypesthesia (diminished sensation) over the upper outer thigh is the classic presentation of meralgia paresthetica. The onset of pain is typically subacute. Sensory loss is quite discrete, and it is often possible to clearly demarcate the area of numbness. The patient often rubs the outer thigh when describing the symptoms. Neurologic symptoms are restricted to sensory changes since the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve does not contain motor fibers.</p><p>A retrospective population-based study found that the pain tends to be unchanged with positions including walking or standing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, other reports have observed that pain can be aggravated by thigh extension or prolonged standing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In some cases, discomfort can be exacerbated by Valsalva maneuvers or other activity that increases intra-abdominal pressure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica is based primarily upon:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The unique description of pain and characteristic location</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory abnormalities on examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of neurologic abnormalities of the lower leg</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sensory function of the upper outer thigh is examined, and a lower extremity neurologic examination should be performed in patients with suspected meralgia paresthetica:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pinprick and light touch tend to be abnormal in a 10 x 6 inch oval-shaped area on the anterolateral thigh (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62268\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62268 \">picture 1</a>). However, the distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is not strictly lateral; thus, abnormalities are occasionally also seen on the anterior thigh.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lower extremity neurologic examination is otherwise normal (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>). In particular, the straight leg raise is negative, and deep tendon reflexes and distal motor strength are preserved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no evidence of hip, back, or sacroiliac joint abnormality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with hip pain&quot;, section on 'Examination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain x-rays of the hip and pelvis are not necessary in patients with characteristic findings on the history and physical examination; no specific changes are evident on plain radiography with this disorder.</p><p>Radiographic studies of the lumbar spine should be obtained when the clinical findings are equivocal to exclude spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, or disk disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrodiagnostic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensory nerve conduction studies have been described for the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/5,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15-18</a>]. However, responses are extremely variable, and it is often difficult to perform this study in overweight individuals. Therefore, if this nerve conduction study is to be performed, it is essential that the contralateral side be studied as well. Electromyography has no role in the diagnosis, as there are no motor manifestations. However, electromyography and nerve conduction studies are occasionally useful to rule out radiculopathy or plexopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve blockade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injection and blockade of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve as it enters the thigh next to the anterior superior iliac spine is uncommonly performed to distinguish meralgia paresthetica from referred pain from the lumbosacral roots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55118\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55118 \">picture 2</a>). Relief of pain with local injection confirms the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The conventional technique employs a fanned-out injection just inferior to and within one inch of the anterior superior iliac spine along the inguinal ligament.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatively, ultrasound can be used to identify the variable position of the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve in relation to the anterior superior iliac spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The injection needle is then advanced under ultrasound guidance to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve via a lateral to medial approach.</p><p/><p>Conventional injection is effective in most cases. It has the disadvantage of using more anesthetic than an ultrasound-guided injection, which is time consuming to obtain, requires a trained technician, and is more costly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica is limited. Lumbar radiculopathy can cause leg numbness, but it is rare that the symptoms or signs are as localized, and back pain is usually present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meralgia paresthetica is a self-limited, benign disease in most patients. Spontaneous remission is frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The goals of treatment are to reassure the patient that this is not a serious condition and to recommend ways to reduce pressure over the nerve in the groin area. Local glucocorticoid injection is used infrequently in patients with refractory symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Nerve blockade'</a> above.)</p><p>Better than 90 percent of patients respond to conservative measures alone, although recurrent symptoms are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20</a>]. Rarely surgery is necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute therapy of meralgia paresthetica includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Educate the patient that the disorder does not represent a serious back problem</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advise the patient to avoid tight garments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss the need for weight loss if appropriate</p><p/><p>Physical therapy does not play a significant role in the management of this disorder. Abdominal toning exercises may reduce pressure over the nerve, but are of unproven value.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with persistent symptoms for more than one to two months, despite the above measures, reexamine the dysesthetic area to confirm the local nature of the problem. Anticonvulsants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> can be helpful in reducing neuropathic pain symptoms.</p><p>Consultation with an anesthesiologist for a local nerve block can also be considered. Injection of a local anesthetic agent, glucocorticoid, or both can be useful to temporarily treat this neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/19,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Nerve blockade'</a> above.)</p><p>Rarely, surgery is necessary in patients with severe chronic symptoms that are refractory more conservative measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decompression of the nerve (sectioning the inferior slip of the attachment of the inguinal ligament to the anterior superior iliac spine) may provide long lasting relief in some. This procedure has the advantage of preserving sensory function. However, it is not uniformly successful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sectioning of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve as it exits the pelvis is the most definitive procedure, but has the disadvantage of permanent anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. From a practical point of view, only patients with intractable dysesthetic pain are willing to undergo a procedure that results in permanent anesthesia.</p><p/><p>One retrospective series reported 167 patients with meralgia paresthetica who had surgical release (n = 153) or transection (n = 14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 98 months, symptomatic improvement and patient satisfaction were observed in 130 (78 percent).</p><p>In a few case reports, patients with refractory symptoms noted improvement after pulsed radiofrequency nerve ablation of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].
