Although there is some overlap, these disorders have characteristic distinguishing features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thromboembolism may occur when an atherosclerotic plaque from large or medium arteries becomes unstable, and superimposed thrombi embolize. The thromboemboli tend to be single, and tend to lodge in small or medium arteries, resulting most often in stroke or transient ischemic attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/6-9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9,12</a>]. Limb ischemia (upper or lower extremity), renal infarction, intestinal ischemia, or ischemia of other organs can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term atheroembolism is used synonymously with cholesterol crystal embolism, cholesterol embolism or micro-atheroembolism. These terms refer to arterio-arterial embolism of fragments of atheromatous material originating from an atherosclerotic plaque of the aorta or occasionally other arteries. The result of such embolization is tissue and organ damage produced by multiple small artery occlusions (eg, &quot;blue toe&quot; syndrome, retinal ischemia, renal failure, livedo reticularis, and intestinal infarction).

Thrombi may be more characteristic of plaques with a high proportion of lipid and with a preponderance of monocytes or macrophages as compared with smooth muscle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The mobile component, as seen on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), is usually thrombus superimposed on the plaque, which has presumably ruptured (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61705\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef61705 \">movie 2</a>).

In a prospective observational cohort study of over 500 patients who underwent TEE, 42 patients were identified as having a complex thoracic aortic plaque and no other detected source of emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

This was illustrated in a study of 36 patients with aortic plaque on TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The plaque was pedunculated and mobile in 11 patients (31 percent), and layered and immobile in 25 (69 percent). Embolic events occurred more frequently in those with pedunculated plaques (8 of 11 versus 3 of 25 [73 versus 12 percent]). These mobile thrombi can occasionally be very large (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61705\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef61705 \">movie 2</a>).</p><p>In patients with mobile aortic plaques, the mobile component has been shown to be primarily thrombus either by direct examination during aortic or cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] or by pathologic examination of tissue obtained during surgery or at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Resolution of mobile aortic masses with anticoagulation and fibrinolytic therapy lends further support to the role of thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].

In a study cited above, the odds ratio for stroke was 13.8 for patients with plaques &gt;4 mm in the aortic arch compared to 1.5 with such lesions in the descending aorta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61664\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61664 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the absence of severe aortic regurgitation, descending aortic lesions generally do not embolize retrograde to the brain; thus, the increased risk may reflect increased atherosclerotic burden.</p><p>Mobile thrombi may be seen in different locations in the same patient at different times. Complex plaques more commonly involve the mid or distal aortic arch or descending aorta, and are relatively uncommon in the ascending aorta. This results in a higher likelihood of embolic events involving the left cerebral hemisphere or the peripheral circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Manipulation of the aorta (cross clamping and performance of the proximal anastomosis) is also thought to predispose to embolization due to mechanical disruption of the atheroma. These procedures also increase the risk of atheroembolism.

Stroke occurred in 12 percent of these patients, six-fold higher than the overall intraoperative stroke risk at that institution.

Statins have a variety of potentially beneficial mechanisms, including antiinflammatory properties that may be beneficial for those with aortic plaques. We recommend statin therapy for all patients with complex aortic plaque, as well as patients with simple plaque and a history of otherwise unexplained stroke or peripheral embolism. The optimal goal LDL or statin <span class=\"nowrap\">dose/intensity</span> in patients without a prior stroke has not been established.

In the previously cited retrospective analysis of 519 patients (64 percent of whom had a history of coronary heart disease), statin therapy was associated with a significant 17 percent absolute reduction in thromboembolic events (12 versus 29 percent in patients not treated with a statin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This apparent clinical benefit probably reflects, at least in part, stabilization or even regression of aortic plaque, which some have attempted to evaluate using imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>]. In one trial, thickness of thoracic and abdominal aortic plaque was measured using magnetic resonance imaging following 12 months of statin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Maximal wall thickness of the thoracic aorta was reduced by 13.8 percent with combination therapy and 12.3 percent in the atorvastatin groups, compared with only 2.2 percent in the etidronate group. Maximal vessel wall thickness of the abdominal aorta was significantly reduced in the combination therapy group compared with atorvastatin group, or etidronate (11.4 versus 0.9 and 5.5 percent, respectively). Although these results are interesting, there was no correlation of observed changes in aortic wall thickness to clinically significant embolic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Randomized trials and large observational studies suggest that, among patients with atherosclerosis who undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), the rate of stroke is reduced with minimally invasive off-pump CABG. The use of intraoperative ultrasound (epicardial or transesophageal echocardiography) to direct the sites of aortic manipulation also may be beneficial. The data supporting these conclusions are presented elsewhere.
