Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity (CIN) is manifested either as acute azotemia, which is largely reversible after reducing the dose, or as chronic progressive renal disease, which is usually irreversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Other renal effects of the calcineurin inhibitors include tubular dysfunction and, rarely, a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) that can lead to acute graft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A similar pattern of renal injury from cyclosporine is seen with the use of tacrolimus, thereby suggesting a drug class effect. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Tacrolimus nephrotoxicity'</a> below.)</p><p>Attention must also be paid to drug dose, other side effects, and drug interactions to minimize toxicity and maximize efficacy.

In the earliest clinical renal transplant trials using cyclosporine, a high incidence of oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI) and primary nonfunction was observed; the risk was greatest with prolonged ischemia time of the donated kidney prior to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Subsequent trials using lower doses of cyclosporine showed that these problems were dose related, although there was considerable variability in the incidence of AKI in various centers.</p><p>Studies have demonstrated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> causes vasoconstriction of the afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and reductions in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The exact mechanism of vasoconstriction is unclear, but there appears to be substantial impairment of endothelial cell function, leading to reduced production of vasodilators (prostaglandins and nitric oxide) and enhanced release of vasoconstrictors (endothelin and thromboxane) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Increased sympathetic tone also may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], although renal vasoconstriction occurs even in denervated kidneys. In addition, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-1, endothelin-1, and the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>There may also be an intrinsic renal susceptibility to cyclosporine-induced renal vasoconstriction. Experimental support for this hypothesis is derived from a study examining the effect of raising the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> dose in eight pairs of stable, unrelated renal transplant recipients who had received a cadaver kidney from the same donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Seven of the eight pairs showed a parallel response to increasing the cyclosporine dose (four pairs showed an elevation in the plasma creatinine concentration, while three pairs showed no change, p&lt;0.05).</p><p>The increase in renal vascular tone induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> may not attenuate with time. Maintenance cyclosporine therapy is associated with transient reductions in renal plasma flow and GFR, which correlate both with dose and with peak cyclosporine levels reached two to four hours after the oral dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These functional abnormalities are also associated with increased urinary excretion of endothelin, which decreases when trough drug levels are reached. Studies with an endothelin receptor antagonist suggest that endothelin mediates cyclosporine-induced afferent arteriolar constriction, an effect that will lower the intraglomerular pressure and the GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Administration of a calcium channel blocker can prevent the renal vasoconstriction, although not the rise in endothelin excretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65894\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65894 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This observation constitutes part of the rationale for the use of calcium channel blockers to treat hypertension in cyclosporine-treated transplant recipients. The role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> in the elevation of blood pressure is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The increase in vascular resistance may therefore be reflected clinically by an elevated plasma creatinine concentration and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/2,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,13</a>]. Cyclosporine-induced renal vasoconstriction can cause delayed recovery from early AKI and, in severe cases, primary nonfunction. These complications are most likely to occur with prolonged ischemia time and high <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; however, even patients with therapeutic trough levels may show signs of nephrotoxicity.</p><p>It is also possible that repeated episodes of renal ischemia contribute to the development of chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> nephrotoxicity described below (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Chronic calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity'</a> below). The continued release of endothelin after administration of a calcium channel blocker suggests that vascular injury may still be occurring. Thus, short-term prevention of renal vasoconstriction, possibly due to limiting endothelin-induced calcium entry into vascular smooth muscle cells, may not necessarily be associated with long-term protection against vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Acute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> nephrotoxicity is usually reversible with cessation of therapy as both the plasma creatinine concentration and systemic blood pressure fall toward baseline values for that patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The important clinical problem is to differentiate cyclosporine-induced renal dysfunction from acute rejection. The only definitive diagnostic test is biopsy of the renal allograft (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute renal allograft rejection&quot;</a>). Although there are no specific pathologic changes induced acutely by cyclosporine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>], the absence of cellular or vascular rejection as well as reversibility of renal dysfunction with drug cessation (over days to a week) strongly suggest cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. It is also important to appreciate that the presence of rejection does not exclude concomitant cyclosporine toxicity.</p><p>Rarely, vascular lesions similar to those in the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are seen. This lesion is idiosyncratic and is presumably initiated by cyclosporine-induced injury to the vascular endothelial cells.

These patients have a 35 to 45 percent reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared with patients not treated with cyclosporine. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal function and nonrenal solid organ transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although reviewed in detail elsewhere within UpToDate, the following is a brief discussion of the best data on the overall incidence of chronic renal failure (CRF) with calcineurin inhibitors, which come from a cohort study of nonrenal transplant recipients (mostly liver, heart, and lung) in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> was given to 60 percent and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> to 28 percent. At a median follow-up of 36 months, 17 percent developed CRF (defined as an estimated GFR [eGFR] &le;29 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>). The risk continued to increase over time with all kinds of transplants and, at five years, ranged from 7 to 21 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F54972\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54972 \">figure 2</a>). These patients had a 4.6-fold increase in the risk of death compared with those without CRF. Risk factors for CRF included calcineurin therapy, older age, lower pretransplant GFR, female sex, postoperative acute renal failure (ARF), baseline diabetes and hypertension, and hepatitis C virus infection.

These changes are seen with both low-dose and higher-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> therapy, although they seem to occur earlier with higher doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/19,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23,24</a>].</p><p>One histologic study reported the association of these changes with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> dose and over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Mild arteriolar hyalinosis at six months appeared to be associated with high doses and was reversible. By comparison, at three years, irreversible severe arteriolar hyalinosis and glomerulosclerosis were observed, despite decreased doses and trough levels.</p><p>The factors responsible for chronic CIN are not well understood. The development of interstitial fibrosis is associated with increased expression of osteopontin (a potent macrophage chemoattractant secreted by the tubular epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]), chemokines (a class of cytokines that are strong chemoattractants for a variety of hematopoietic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta, a powerful stimulator of extracellular matrix production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]).</p><p>Support for a central role for TGF-beta has been provided by findings in mice in which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> nephropathy was significantly diminished with anti-TGF-beta therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. TGF-beta appears to be induced in part by decreased secretion of nitric oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] as well as increased local concentrations of angiotensin II, possibly explaining at least in part the beneficial effects observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/26,28,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28,33</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> is a substrate for the transmembrane pump P-glycoprotein. There is some evidence in animals and in vitro that decreased expression of this pump may contribute to increased cyclosporine levels, leading to nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Altered protein pump expression has also been observed in association with several polymorphisms in its gene. As an example, the TT genotype is associated with decreased P-glycoprotein expression in the kidney. In a case-control study of donor and recipient pairs, the TT genotype in the donor directly correlated with chronic cyclosporine nephrotoxicity in the allograft recipient (odds ratio [OR] 13.4, 95% CI 1.2-148) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This suggests that underlying genetic factors that increase cyclosporine concentrations in the kidney may contribute to chronic nephrotoxicity.</p><p>It has been proposed that the arterial lesions are the primary abnormality, with secondary ischemia being responsible for the tubular and interstitial lesions. Some animal studies, for example, have shown that the vascular and interstitial findings can be dissociated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report found that inhibiting angiotensin II with an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a>) minimized the interstitial fibrosis without affecting the glomerular or tubular injury; this beneficial effect was not observed with the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study had somewhat different results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

This finding may help explain the interstitial abnormalities associated with cyclosporine toxicity: the loss of cells and renal tubules accompanied by fibrosis. The expression of specific apoptotic genes, such as p53 and Fas-ligand, is enhanced in rats administered cyclosporine, thereby favoring the induction of apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyclosporine dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether there is a &quot;safe&quot; chronic dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> that is effective immunologically, but does not cause progressive renal dysfunction, is difficult to answer because of the lack of well-controlled prospective trials.

This was thought to principally be the result of calcineurin inhibitor injury. By comparison, chronic immune rejection was uncommon with prolonged follow-up.
