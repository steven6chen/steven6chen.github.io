While most children and up to one-half of adults experience prolonged disease-free survival, many adults and some children will relapse and die of leukemia. Relapse is thought to result from residual leukemic cells that remain following the achievement of &quot;complete&quot; remission, but are below the limits of detection using conventional morphologic assessment. These subclinical levels of residual leukemia are termed &quot;minimal residual disease&quot; (MRD) or &quot;measureable residual disease&quot; and can be evaluated using more sensitive assays. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Detection of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MRD status is one of the most powerful predictors of disease-free and overall survival for children and adults with ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, not all patients with MRD positivity will relapse clinically, and some patients relapse despite negative MRD studies. The immunophenotypic or genetic markers identified at diagnosis on the bulk of malignant cells may not be identical to those expressed by other leukemia clones. Thus, recurrent disease may arise from occult malignant progenitor cells that lack the markers assayed on their more populous progeny. Alternatively, some ALL cells with abnormal markers may persist for some time after treatment but lack the ability to recapitulate the disease either because of an inherited defect or the immune system.</p><p>While the timing and type of tests applied varies, MRD assays are routinely used in the clinical care of children and adults with ALL. This topic review will focus on the clinical relevance of MRD monitoring in ALL. The methods for MRD monitoring in ALL and the use of MRD testing in acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia are covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Detection of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Remission criteria in acute myeloid leukemia and monitoring for residual disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Monitoring response'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4006374491\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for MRD has become a common part of the management of children and adults with ALL. MRD status at various time points during and after treatment has prognostic value, and initial studies suggest that altering therapy based on the results of MRD testing will improve morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Ongoing clinical trials are examining the use of MRD both as a prognostic factor and as a factor in decision making to determine whether therapy intensity should be escalated or reduced in a given patient. Specific questions regarding MRD testing that remain include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the best test to measure MRD?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What number of abnormal cells should be used to define MRD status?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At what time in the <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/treatment</span> course should MRD be measured?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should treatment be intensified or hematopoietic cell transplantation be recommended for patients with MRD positivity?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can treatment intensity be reduced for patients with no detectable MRD?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there value in long-term MRD surveillance after the completion of therapy?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How does the information gained from MRD testing differ among various ALL subtypes (eg, T cell versus B cell ALL or Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Must the leukemic clone be completely eliminated in order to achieve long-term survival?</p><p/><p>The interpretation of MRD tests is complicated and must take into account the timing of MRD assessment, the level of MRD detected, the sensitivity of the test modality used, and the treatment regimen. Some clinicians apply more than one MRD assessment technique, either simultaneously or in tandem, in order to minimize false-negative results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In many studies, MRD has been assessed at multiple time points in order to risk stratify patients based on the disease trajectory. Risk stratification schemes used in modern pediatric treatment protocols commonly incorporate information about whether there has been a &quot;rapid response to therapy&quot; (eg, disappearance of bone marrow blasts at days 8 [14 in adults] and 29) or a &quot;slow response to therapy&quot; (eg, presence of blasts at day 8 [or 14 in adults] and negative at day 29). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-group-stratification-and-prognosis-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk group stratification and prognosis for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MRD IN CHILDREN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognostic value</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending upon the method used, up to 70 percent of children with ALL will have MRD detectable immediately following the completion of induction therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], with levels declining in most patients during the first six months of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Multiple studies have shown that patients with detectable MRD have significantly higher relapse rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/6-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-15</a>]. The timing of MRD disappearance and reappearance appears to affect its prognostic value.</p><p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques and multicolor flow cytometry are sufficiently sensitive, specific, and reproducible for MRD assessment in most patients. More robust techniques using multiplex PCR with deep sequencing and next-generation flow cytometry are under investigation. Multicolor flow cytometry is most commonly used in the United States. The ideal test is unknown and likely differs depending upon the ALL subtype and the clinical scenario.

In addition to its potential to impact treatment decisions (discussed in more detail below), MRD analysis may allow for modifications in the treatment response assessment. As an example, the prognostic value of MRD status at the end of induction (using a cutoff threshold of 0.01 percent) provides independent and predictive information and thus allows for the elimination of day 14 bone marrow examinations in the vast majority of children with ALL.</p><p>The following studies illustrate the prognostic value of MRD measurements in children treated with conventional chemotherapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An initial study used flow cytometry of bone marrow samples to evaluate MRD in 158 children with ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Samples were collected after induction therapy and during weeks 14, 32, and 56 of continuation therapy, and again at 120 weeks (end of therapy). Leukemia cells were detectable in 23, 17, 5, and 4 percent of patients after remission induction and at weeks 14, 32, and 56, respectively. None of the 65 samples examined at the completion of therapy (week 120) showed evidence of disease. At all time points, MRD detection was associated with a significantly higher rate of relapse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study measured MRD by PCR on day 46 in 455 children with B cell lineage ALL treated with contemporary regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. MRD was undetectable in 58 percent; &lt;0.001 percent in 11 percent; 0.001 to &lt;0.01 percent in 14 percent; and 0.01 percent or greater in 17 percent. The five-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was higher among those with MRD of 0.01 percent or greater versus MRD of &lt;0.01 percent or undetectable MRD (23 versus 6 percent). Furthermore, the five-year CIR was higher among those with MRD 0.001 to &lt;0.01 percent versus MRD &lt;0.001 percent or undetectable (13 versus 5 percent). These results suggest a prognostic impact for MRD detected below the conventional threshold of 0.01 percent. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large collaborative European study (AIEOP-BFM 2000 study), 3184 children with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B cell lineage ALL were risk stratified by MRD status (PCR sensitivity &le;0.01 percent) at day 33 (end of induction) and day 78 (start of consolidation with significantly different event-free survival [EFS] and OS at five years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Standard risk (42 percent): Those with MRD &le;0.01 percent at both time points had EFS and OS of 92 and 98 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intermediate risk (52 percent): Those with MRD &gt;0.01 percent at either time point (and &lt;0.1 percent on day 78) had EFS and OS of 78 and 93 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High risk (6 percent): Those with MRD &ge;0.1 percent on day 78 had EFS and OS of 50 and 60 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of 7430 children enrolled on Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group (COG) studies, evaluation of MRD by flow cytometry on day 29 was highly predictive of patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Estimated DFS at five years was significantly higher among patients who were MRD negative (89 versus 72 percent, respectively). Among patients who were MRD negative, five-year DFS was similar regardless of whether they had morphologic evidence of disease on a day 14 bone marrow (89 versus 91 percent). Similarly, patients who had no morphologic evidence of disease on day 14, but were MRD positive on day 29, had similar five-year DFS as those who had detectable disease at either time (77 versus 72 percent). These results suggest that MRD status using a threshold of 0.01 percent at the end of induction obviates the need for analysis at day 14. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, MRD remained detectable in the bone marrow by flow cytometry in nearly half of children on day 19 of induction therapy and was associated with a higher chance of relapse (five-year CIR 33 versus 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These results suggest that MRD status has prognostic value even when measured before the end of induction therapy. </p><p/><p>These and other studies have demonstrated that either semi-quantitative PCR or flow cytometry may be used to assess MRD in childhood ALL. However, these data were derived from prospective clinical trials where special expertise was available in central research laboratories, and individual patients submitted both pretreatment and post-treatment samples.

The absolute risk varies depending upon a number of factors including the timing of MRD evaluation, the sensitivity of the method used to evaluate MRD, and baseline characteristics of the patient and tumor. Given this increased rate of relapse, prospective trials have attempted to decrease this risk by escalating therapy in those demonstrating MRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].</p><p>In the UKALL 2003 trial, 533 patients clinically identified as having standard-risk or intermediate-risk ALL at diagnosis and who had MRD in the bone marrow at the end of induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive standard or augmented post-remission therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

In this group, 83 percent had appropriate donors and underwent HCT, while 17 percent received chemotherapy without HCT because no donor was available. EFS was higher for patients receiving HCT versus those receiving chemotherapy alone (64 versus 24 percent).

Clinical criteria were initially used to classify the disease as standard-, intermediate-, or high-risk, then MRD measurements following induction and before interim maintenance were used to further revise this classification. Patients with standard or intermediate clinical risk who achieved MRD negativity were randomly assigned to receive one or two delayed intensification treatments. When compared with those assigned to the standard two delayed intensification treatments, those assigned to a single intensification had a similar estimated EFS (94.4 versus 95.5 percent), OS (97.9 versus 98.5 percent), and rate of relapse (4.2 versus 2.3 percent) at five years.

Intensive therapy, such as allogeneic HCT is associated with high rates of age-related morbidity and mortality. Initial attempts have been made to use MRD to identify patients who require such escalated care. In contrast, it is less likely that there is a large group of patients that may be treated with less intensive therapy without compromising survival. As such, the potential for MRD monitoring to allow for a reduction in therapy in adults is less than it is for children.

However, residual disease is a dynamic process, with the numbers of residual leukemic cells fluctuating over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/47,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,79</a>]. Although levels of residual disease may fall below the detection limit of even highly sensitive molecular assays shortly after therapy, the leukemic cells do not necessarily disappear when the patient enters into clinical remission. They may subsequently increase until clinically overt disease recurs, or they may fall below the threshold of detection again. A &quot;positive&quot; to &quot;negative&quot; to &quot;positive&quot; pattern of PCR results is commonly seen. As such, therapeutic decisions on whether to continue therapy or begin salvage therapy cannot at present be based solely upon a single positive MRD result. However, if a positive MRD result persists, efforts should be made to prepare for potential disease relapse in the future.
