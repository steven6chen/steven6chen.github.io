LyP is part of the group of cutaneous CD30<sup>+</sup> lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) that includes primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) and borderline CD30<sup>+</sup> lesions. Clinicopathologic correlation is essential for establishing the diagnosis of LyP, as there are many clinical and histologic mimics of LyP.</p><p>LyP is characterized by a chronic course, lasting years or decades. Grouped or generalized papules and nodules develop and spontaneously regress over weeks to months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F71441\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71441 \">picture 3D</a>). Patients with LyP have an excellent prognosis, although they are at increased risk of developing a second cutaneous or nodal lymphoma, such as mycosis fungoides, PC-ALCL, or Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of LyP.

It occurs in patients of all ethnic groups with a peak incidence in the fifth decade. However, LyP may occur in children and individuals older than 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. A bimodal distribution by age and sex has been noted, with a male predominance among pediatric cases and a female predominance among adult cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F82789\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82789 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most patients with LyP and 6p25.3 gene rearrangement are older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-cell-receptor-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T cell receptor genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>LyP is associated with a lifelong increased risk of malignant lymphoma. In 5 to 20 percent of patients, LyP may be preceded, associated with, or followed by a malignant lymphoma, generally mycosis fungoides (MF), cutaneous or systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/3,5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7532316\" class=\"local\">'Associated lymphomas'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18325853\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is unknown. The hypothesis of a viral etiology has not been confirmed. In several studies, oncogenic or lymphotropic viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus, herpes viruses 6, 7, and 8, and human T cell <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span> virus were not detected in LyP lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17871189\"><span class=\"h2\">Overexpression of CD30</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overexpression of CD30 on the large atypical T cells found in the skin lesions is the hallmark of LyP and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL). CD30 is a cell surface cytokine receptor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily 8, first identified on the Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin lymphoma. CD30 is expressed on activated T and B cells but not on mature circulating T or B cells. The interaction of CD30 with its membrane-associated glycoprotein ligand (CD30L) activates the NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway resulting in either cell proliferation or apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>The genetic abnormalities underlying the CD30 overexpression in LyP are largely unknown. One study found that two allelic forms of the CD30 promoter microsatellite repressive element, designated 30M377 and 30M362, were associated with the development of LyP and progression to CD30<sup>+</sup> lymphomas in LyP patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These findings suggest that allele-specific differences in the control of CD30 transcription may have a role in the pathogenesis of CD30<sup>+</sup> cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17871982\"><span class=\"h2\">Clonality of T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monoclonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor (<em>TCR</em>) genes has been detected in 40 to 100 percent of the LyP skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. In patients with LyP and associated lymphoma, identical rearrangements have been identified in LyP lesions and lymphoma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/22-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7532316\" class=\"local\">'Associated lymphomas'</a> below.)</p><p>Several studies indicate that the CD30<sup>+</sup> cells are the clonal T cells in LyP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/17,22,23,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22,23,31,32</a>]. However, it is not known whether the clonal T cells persist in the skin or in the peripheral blood during the remission periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In an analysis of the <em>TCR</em> gene rearrangements, multiple skin and blood samples were obtained from patients with LyP at the time of active disease and remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Overall, clonal T cell populations were detected in 78 percent of the skin samples and in 36 percent of blood samples. The direct comparison of the clonal T cell populations detected in the lesional skin and corresponding blood sample of each patient revealed a different rearrangement pattern in all instances. These findings suggest that T cell clones detected in the peripheral blood of LyP patients are non-neoplastic and represent a reactive response to an unknown antigen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17871988\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic abnormalities found in LyP by classic cytogenetic studies include aneuploidy and chromosomal aberrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/10,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,33</a>]. The t(2;5)(p23,q35) translocation characteristic of systemic ALCL has not been found in LyP cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, there is immunohistochemical evidence of increased expression in LyP cells of the oncogenic transcription factor gene <em>Fra2</em> and inhibitor of differentiation gene <em>Id2</em>, which are located in close proximity to the t(2;5) breakpoint, suggesting a pathogenetic relationship between LyP and systemic ALCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>A subset of LyP cases affecting mainly older adult patients has been found to have chromosomal rearrangements involving the DUSP22-IRF4 locus on 6p25.3, a genetic abnormality seen in approximately 28 percent of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphomas (PC-ALCLs) but absent in 97 percent of conventional types of LyP. Histologically, lesions showed a biphasic growth pattern, with small cerebriform lymphocytes in the epidermis and larger transformed lymphocytes in the dermis. All had a T cell immunophenotype but were often negative for both CD4 and CD8. The pathologic features raised the possibility of an aggressive T cell lymphoma such as transformed mycosis fungoides. However, no patient developed disseminated skin disease or extracutaneous spread. Untreated lesions regressed spontaneously, characteristic of LyP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A novel, recurrent <em>NPM1-TYK2</em> gene fusion has been reported in biopsy samples of LyP and PC-ALCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This finding supports the hypothesis that <em>NPM1-TYK2</em> mediates the activation of <span class=\"nowrap\">STAT1/3/5</span> signaling to promote cell proliferation. The inactivation of <em>TYK2</em> significantly diminished proliferation, suggesting that <em>TYK2</em> is an oncogenic driver kinase and a potential therapeutic target in a subset of CD30<sup>+</sup> cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17871994\"><span class=\"h2\">Spontaneous regression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms underlying the spontaneous regression of LyP lesions are unknown. The prevailing hypothesis is that the coexpression of CD30 and the death receptor CD95 (Fas) ligands in LyP lesions may be responsible for the self-regression of LyP lesions by enhanced apoptosis of proliferating cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This hypothesis is supported by several observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LyP and plaque-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) have a higher <span class=\"nowrap\">apoptosis/proliferation</span> ratio than more aggressive cutaneous lymphomas such as tumor stage MF, cutaneous T cell lymphomas with tumor masses, or cutaneous B cell lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The large atypical CD30<sup>+</sup> cells of LyP have a low expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pro-apoptotic protein BAX is expressed at higher levels in LyP and CD30<sup>+</sup> ALCL than in systemic CD30<sup>+</sup> lymphoma, which does not undergo spontaneous regression and has an aggressive clinical behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7532316\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED LYMPHOMAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) have an increased risk of developing a cutaneous or nodal lymphoid malignancy, including mycosis fungoides (most common), cutaneous or nodal anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and Hodgkin lymphoma. Some cases originally believed to be Hodgkin lymphoma may actually represent T cell lymphomas with Reed-Sternberg-like cells expressing CD30 and CD15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. LyP-associated lymphomas develop in 5 to over 50 percent of patients and may occur before, concurrent with, or after the onset of LyP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/3,5,8,21,26,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,8,21,26,43,44</a>].

The finding of identical <em>TCR</em> gene rearrangements in LyP and LyP-associated lymphomas suggests that both disorders arise from a common lymphoid progenitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of LyP to malignant lymphoma are unknown. The progression of LyP to ALCL appears to be mediated by the loss of cell growth regulation induced by inactivating mutations of cell surface receptors for transforming growth factor (TGF) beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/31,32,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,46</a>].</p><p>There are no clinical or histopathologic criteria to predict the progression of LyP to a malignant lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Observational studies have identified several potential markers of increased risk, including monoclonal TCR gene rearrangement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]; coexistence of different histologic types of LyP in individual patient; B and C histologic subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]; fascin expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphomatoid-papulosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]; or high blood levels of soluble CD30, CD25, IL-6, and IL-8.

Early lesions show a limited perivascular collection of lymphocytes with few inflammatory cells and large atypical cells. As lesions evolve, there is accumulation of dermal lymphocytes admixed with large atypical cells resembling immunoblasts, including bi- and multi-nucleated forms similar to <span class=\"nowrap\">Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg</span> cells of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).</p><p>A variable number of inflammatory cells, mostly neutrophils and eosinophils, are also seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F82763\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82763 \">picture 1A</a>). Neutrophils are usually found within the lumina of small dermal capillaries and serve as a useful diagnostic marker of LyP. Some degree of neutrophilic infiltration of the overlying epidermis is commonly seen, especially in advanced lesions, and may be associated with initial ulceration. Fully developed LyP lesions typically have a wedge-shaped configuration with a deep-lying apex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F82764\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82764 \">picture 1B</a>).</p><p>There are six major histologic types of LyP lesions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type A</strong> &ndash; Type A is the most common (about 75 percent of cases) and is characterized by a wedge-shaped infiltrate of scattered or clustered large atypical CD30<sup>+</sup> cells, intermingled with numerous inflammatory cells, such as small lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and histiocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F82764\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82764 \">picture 1B</a>). Type A resembles the polymorphous infiltrates of Hodgkin lymphoma.
