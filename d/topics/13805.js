A discussion of Castleman's disease is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multicentric-castlemans-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multicentric Castleman's disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1938, a patient was described with sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, hyperpigmentation, elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein, and a solitary plasmacytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Eighteen years later, two patients were reported with peripheral neuropathy, hyperpigmentation, elevation of cerebrospinal fluid protein, and plasmacytomas with new bone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In 1980, the acronym &quot;POEMS&quot; was suggested for this disorder, representing the following constellation of findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyneuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organomegaly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrinopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monoclonal protein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin changes</p><p/><p>Additional features described in this syndrome include sclerotic bone lesions, Castleman's disease, papilledema, pleural effusion, edema, ascites, erythrocytosis, and thrombocytosis. This disorder has also been called osteosclerotic myeloma, Crow-Fukase syndrome, PEP syndrome (plasma cell dyscrasia, endocrinopathy, polyneuropathy), or Takatsuki syndrome. The complex interrelationships among POEMS syndrome, osteosclerotic myeloma, and Castleman's disease are still being investigated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6653014\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of POEMS syndrome is unknown, although chronic overproduction of pro-inflammatory and other cytokines (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) appears to be a major feature of this disorder, with microangiopathy, edema, effusions, and increased vascular permeability, neovascularization, polyneuropathy, pulmonary hypertension, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis as possible examples of their effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>Patients frequently have higher levels of interleukin-1&szlig; (IL-1&szlig;), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) than patients with multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It has been postulated that manifestations of POEMS syndrome might be regarded as the result of a marked activation of these cytokines associated with a weak or decreased TGF-&szlig;1 antagonistic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Serum IL-6 levels in six patients with active POEMS syndrome were higher than those with stable POEMS; elevated levels of serum IL-6 increased before each exacerbation of clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Elevated levels of IL-6 have also been reported in pericardial fluid in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Others have demonstrated that platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] or plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>] were a major source of VEGF, a potent inducer of increased vascular permeability. In addition, elevated levels of VEGF were noted to decrease significantly in patients with POEMS syndrome following successful therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/7,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of angiogenesis inhibitors&quot;, section on 'Vascular endothelial growth factor'</a>.)</p><p>Elevation of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1) have also been reported in POEMS syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183189536\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>POEMS syndrome is a rare disorder. The exact incidence is unknown due to the complexity of the clinical manifestations that are multisystemic. As with other plasma cell dyscrasias, POEMS syndrome commonly presents in the fifth to sixth decade. In a Mayo Clinic series of 99 patients with this syndrome, the median age was 51 years (range: 30 to 83) and 63 percent were males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24164771\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of POEMS syndrome are protean. By definition, all patients have peripheral neuropathy and a monoclonal plasma cell disorder, almost always of the lambda light chain type. In addition, almost all patients have osteosclerotic lesions. Castleman's disease is present in approximately 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One should therefore be cautious about diagnosing POEMS syndrome in the absence of osteosclerotic lesions. The prevalence of other manifestations (eg, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, skin changes, edema, and papilledema) varies greatly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66534\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66534 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In the Mayo Clinic series of 99 patients, the following features were present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyneuropathy &ndash; 100 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monoclonal plasma cell disorder &ndash; 100 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein (&gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> &ndash; 100 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteosclerotic bone lesions &ndash; 97 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin changes &ndash; 68 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrinopathy &ndash; 67 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organomegaly (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy) &ndash; 50 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss (&gt;10 pounds) &ndash; 37 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue &ndash; 31 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Papilledema &ndash; 29 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Edema, ascites, pleural effusion &ndash; 29 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Castleman's disease &ndash; 15 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clubbing &ndash; 5 percent</p><p/><p>In addition, elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels have been reported in approximately two-thirds of patients with POEMS syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Based upon this and other series, clinical features have been divided into mandatory criteria, major criteria, and minor criteria for the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64782 \">table 2</a>). Other signs and symptoms that do not fall into these criteria can be present as well. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24164777\"><span class=\"h2\">Mandatory criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, all patients with POEMS syndrome have peripheral neuropathy and a monoclonal plasma cell disorder, almost always of the lambda light chain type.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral neuropathy is required for the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome, and usually dominates the clinical picture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Symptoms begin in the feet and consist of tingling, paresthesias, and feelings of coldness. Motor involvement follows the sensory symptoms. Both are distal, symmetric, and progressive, with a gradual proximal spread. Severe weakness occurs in more than half of patients and results in an inability to climb stairs, rise from a chair, or grip objects firmly with the hands, consistent with a predominantly motor chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The course is progressive and patients may be confined to a wheelchair. Autonomic symptoms are not a feature. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>Physical examination reveals a symmetric sensorimotor neuropathy involving the extremities. Muscle weakness is more marked than sensory loss. Touch, pressure, vibratory, and joint position senses are often involved. Less frequently, loss of temperature discrimination and nociception occur. Cranial nerves are not affected.</p><p>Electromyographic studies show slowing of nerve conduction, prolonged distal latencies, and severe attenuation of compound muscle action potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Conduction block is rarely found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], but slowing of motor conduction is proportionately greater than the reduction in the compound muscle action potential amplitude. Distal fibrillation potentials are found on needle electromyography.</p><p>Biopsy of the sural nerve usually shows both axonal degeneration and demyelination; severe endoneurial edema may also be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A loss of myelinated fibers and an increased frequency of axonal degeneration in teased fibers have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], along with high expression of VEGF in vasa nervorum and some non-myelin-forming Schwann cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Endoneurial deposits of immunoglobulins of the same type as in the serum have been reported in three of four patients with POEMS syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24164786\"><span class=\"h3\">Monoclonal plasma cell disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients by definition must have evidence of a monoclonal plasma cell proliferative disorder, either on serum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urine immunofixation studies, or on immunostaining or flow cytometric studies done on the bone marrow or lymph node in the case of Castleman's disease. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>Findings based on the Mayo Clinic series are listed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall, 88 percent of patients had a monoclonal protein in the serum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urine. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eighty-five percent had a monoclonal protein in the serum. The magnitude of serum monoclonal protein was small, with a median serum M-spike of 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL;</span> only seven patients had an M-spike of more than 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. This is similar to the 75 percent reported in another series of 102 patients with this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum protein electrophoresis is normal in one-fourth of patients, and some patients can have a pattern suggesting the presence of a polyclonal gammopathy. In these patients, the monoclonal protein can be overlooked if immunofixation is not performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forty percent had a monoclonal protein in the urine; the amount was small, with a median value of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of light chain seen in POEMS syndrome is almost always lambda [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The associated heavy chain was IgA, IgG, or IgM in 44, 40, and 1 patient each, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clonal lambda plasma cell proliferative process was demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining of biopsy specimens in all 12 patients who did not have a monoclonal protein in their serum or urine.</p><p/><p>A random bone marrow examination is most often nondiagnostic, showing a hypercellular, &quot;reactive-appearing,&quot; or normal-appearing marrow. Less than 15 percent have bone marrow plasmacytosis &gt;10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/1,20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20,22</a>]. Less than 5 percent have &gt;20 percent plasma cells, but this is not accompanied by lytic bone lesions or anemia suggestive of the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. An increase in plasma cells is typically only seen in sclerotic bone lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24164916\"><span class=\"h2\">Major criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three major criteria for the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome are osteosclerotic bone lesions, elevated VEGF levels, and Castleman's disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia), which are seen in 97, 68, and 15 to 25 percent, respectively. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24164997\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteosclerotic bone lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteosclerotic lesions appeared in conventional radiographs in 97 percent of patients in the Mayo Clinic study (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109377\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109377 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Forty-seven percent had only sclerotic lesions, 51 percent had mixed sclerotic and lytic lesions, while lytic lesions without evidence of sclerosis were seen in only 2 percent of patients with bone lesions. These lesions may be small in size and misinterpreted as benign bony sclerosis. In addition, a small sclerotic rim surrounding a large lytic lesion may be easily overlooked.</p><p>A solitary osteosclerotic bone lesion is found in 45 percent of patients, while the remainder has multiple lesions. The pelvis, spine, ribs, and proximal extremities were most often involved. Bone pain and pathologic fractures are rare; hypercalcemia does not occur at presentation. Although osteosclerotic myeloma is a characteristic feature of POEMS syndrome, there are occasional patients with multiple myeloma who have osteosclerotic bone lesions in the absence of POEMS syndrome.</p><p>Imaging with computed tomography (CT) scan or bone scintigraphy is more sensitive for the detection of bone lesions than plain films [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Since the lesions have variable FDG uptake, positron emission tomography (PET) scan may not detect all lesions seen on CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. However, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> may be helpful in monitoring response to treatment in patients with high baseline FDG uptake. (See <a href=\"#H183189752\" class=\"local\">'Response assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>On pathologic examination, bone biopsy demonstrates diffuse infiltration of light chain restricted plasma cells. The histopathologic finding of lambda-restricted plasma cell rimming around lymphoid aggregates and megakaryocytic hyperplasia in bone marrow is highly suggestive of POEMS syndrome rather than other plasma cell dyscrasias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24165257\"><span class=\"h3\">Elevated VEGF levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevation of serum or plasma VEGF levels is an important feature of the POEMS syndrome, and can be followed to assess response to therapy. While the normal reference ranges for these tests and the optimal cutoff for the diagnosis of POEMS are not well defined, the Mayo Clinic criteria for diagnosis consider a VEGF level at least three to four times the upper limit of normal to be a major criterion for diagnosis. Importantly, when comparing VEGF values over time, the method of VEGF measurement used for both values must be the same. (See <a href=\"#H183189752\" class=\"local\">'Response assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>In general, serum VEGF levels tend to be more than 5- to 10-fold higher in POEMS syndrome compared with normal controls and those seen in other neuropathic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/13,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,30</a>]. However, serum levels of VEGF are affected by the unpredictable release of platelet-derived VEGF because of ex vivo platelet activation during the clotting process as well as the presence of thrombocytosis in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Plasma VEGF levels appear to be at least as good as, if not better than, serum levels. In a study of 105 patients (29 with POEMS, 9 with Castleman's disease, 15 with monoclonal plasma cell disorders, 52 with other disorders), a plasma VEGF level &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> had a sensitivity and specificity of 68 and 95 percent, respectively, in support of a diagnosis of POEMS syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In this study, all patients who had treatment showed both clinical improvement as well as a reduction in plasma levels of VEGF. However, there was no significant difference in plasma VEGF levels on day 180 or last follow-up between those who did or did not achieve complete clinical remission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24165736\"><span class=\"h3\">Castleman's disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Castleman's disease (giant cell lymph node hyperplasia, angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) and POEMS syndrome have been frequently associated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In one small series, two of three patients with POEMS syndrome were reported with Castleman's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Antibodies to human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), a virus implicated in the pathogenesis of Castleman's disease, mainly HIV-associated, were reported in seven of nine patients with POEMS syndrome and Castleman's disease. Nine of 18 patients had circulating anti-HHV-8 antibodies, while six of seven patients with POEMS syndrome and Castleman's disease had HHV-8 DNA sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multicentric-castlemans-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multicentric Castleman's disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 15 percent of patients in the Mayo Clinic series with POEMS syndrome also have Castleman's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], similar to the 19 to 24 percent noted in two other major series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. This may be an underestimation, since many patients do not undergo lymph node biopsy. In one series, 25 of 43 biopsied lymph nodes demonstrated Castleman's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Elevated levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in the absence of primary hypogonadism levels have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In a Mayo Clinic study of 170 patients with POEMS syndrome, over 70 percent of males tested were found to have hypogonadism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In this study, 10 (seven men and three women) of 35 patients tested had hyperprolactinemia, and 10 of 38 men had gynecomastia. Serum estradiol levels were normal in all four women in whom it was measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fourteen of 48 patients (29 percent) in the Mayo Clinic study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] had hypothyroidism requiring therapy.

The major dermatologic findings consist of hyperpigmentation and hemangiomas, with the latter having histopathological features similar to those found in renal glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poems-syndrome/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. These lesions, termed glomeruloid hemangioma, present as multiple red-purple lesions on the trunk and proximal limbs.</p><p>Hyperpigmentation is present in almost one-half of patients; this finding can be easily overlooked. Hypertrichosis, manifested by coarse black hair, appears on the extremities in one-fourth of patients. It is either generalized or limited to certain body areas, such as the extremities or face.

In the subgroup of 90 patients diagnosed with POEMS syndrome between 2000 and 2008, 9 (10 percent) had a stroke at a median of 23 months (range: 0.5 to 64 months) after the onset of peripheral neuropathy symptoms, for a five-year risk of stroke of 13.4 percent.

Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for the disease since it is an uncommon syndrome that manifests with varied clinical features. The diagnosis requires the clinical features of polyneuropathy, the pathologic identification of a monoclonal plasma cell proliferative disorder, and the presence of at least one major and one minor criterion on physical examination, imaging, or laboratory evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24166172\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients suspected of having POEMS should initially undergo a complete history and physical examination. The history should pay specific attention to complaints of neurological symptoms, skin changes, extravascular volume overload, and symptoms suggestive of an endocrine disorder (eg, gynecomastia, irregular menses). As in any complex illness, a detailed physical examination is critical, with emphasis on the funduscopic examination for papilledema, neurologic examination, evaluation for organomegaly, examination of the skin, and evaluation for the presence of peripheral edema, pleural or pericardial effusion, ascites, clubbing, heart failure, and cardiomyopathy.</p><p>In addition, we perform the following studies as an initial screen to look for POEMS syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete blood count and differential with examination of the peripheral blood smear.

The M-protein in the serum and urine is almost always present in a low concentration (usually less than 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> and may be easily overlooked unless immunofixation is performed on both serum and a 24-hour urine collection.
