Myomectomy, the removal of uterine leiomyomas (myomas or fibroids), can be performed laparoscopically in selected women. Other laparoscopic procedures have been developed for leiomyoma treatment, including uterine artery occlusion and myolysis, but these are not commonly used. </p><p>Uterine leiomyomas are the most common type of pelvic tumor in women, with an approximately 70 to 80 percent lifetime risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. There are a wide variety of treatments for leiomyomas, both pharmacologic and surgical. The choice of treatments depends upon many factors, including characteristics of the myomas, the patient, and surgical expertise. </p><p>Laparoscopic myomectomy and other laparoscopic procedures for uterine leiomyomas will be reviewed here. Abdominal, hysteroscopic, and vaginal myomectomy, as well as other approaches to the management of leiomyomas, are discussed separately.

There are a variety of treatment approaches, both pharmacologic and surgical.</p><p>The choice between myomectomy and other treatments is discussed in detail separately.

However, the wide application of laparoscopic myomectomy is limited by the characteristics of myomas that can be reasonably removed and the surgical expertise required (eg, laparoscopic suturing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Robot-assisted myomectomy has similar outcomes to laparoscopic myomectomy, with longer operating times and higher costs. Hysteroscopic myomectomy is the procedure of choice for women with intracavitary myomas (submucosal and some intramural myomas that protrude into the endometrial cavity).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3730094\"><span class=\"h3\">Candidates for laparoscopic myomectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining whether a woman is a candidate for laparoscopic myomectomy depends upon the location, size, and number of leiomyomas, although parameters for these vary with surgical expertise. These criteria are used to ensure that women undergoing the procedure avoid perioperative complications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> conversion to laparotomy. Preoperative imaging is important to assess the precise characteristics of the tumors. (See <a href=\"#H26569434\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>Important factors regarding the location of fibroids include the depth of penetration into the myometrium and position relative to important structures (eg, uterine vessels, fallopian tubes). Pedunculated subserosal fibroids are the easiest to remove, but myomas in other locations can also be excised laparoscopically. In addition, many surgeons find anterior or fundal myomas easier to remove than those that are posterior. Performing laparoscopic myomectomy in women with large or numerous myomas is likely to be time consuming, particularly since morcellation is usually required. In addition, removal of such fibroids may lead to increased blood loss, which is better prevented and controlled during open myomectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy#H1388946\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques to reduce blood loss during abdominal or laparoscopic myomectomy&quot;, section on 'Intraoperative measures'</a>.) </p><p>Few data address the optimal criteria for a successful laparoscopic myomectomy, and the ability to successfully perform a laparoscopic myomectomy also depends in large part on surgical expertise. The largest study was a prospective multicenter study of 2050 women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Leiomyoma characteristics that were significantly associated with major complications (eg, bleeding requiring blood transfusion, visceral injury, procedural failure) included: size of myoma &gt;5 cm; &gt;3 myomas removed; and intraligamentous location; intramural myomas were significantly associated with an increase in minor, but not major, complications (eg, fever, uterine manipulator injuries). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3730101\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic versus open myomectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In appropriately selected patients, laparoscopic myomectomy has lower overall morbidity and a shorter recovery time than open myomectomy. </p><p>A systematic review of six randomized trials including 576 women compared laparoscopic with abdominal myomectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Laparoscopic myomectomy had a statistically significant increase in operative duration (13 min longer), but a decrease in blood loss (34 ml less). However, these differences are small and unlikely to be clinically significant. The overall risk of complication was significantly lower for laparoscopic myomectomy (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.26-0.85), but there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of major complications (eg, hemorrhage requiring transfusion, visceral injury, thromboembolism) (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.09-2.70); however, the analysis lacked sufficient statistical power to detect this difference. Two of the trials reported that significantly more patients in the laparoscopic group had fully recuperated by postoperative day 15. Although the data were too heterogeneous for meta-analysis, the shorter recovery time for laparoscopic surgery is well established. </p><p>Regarding long-term outcomes, follow-up ranged widely across studies in the meta-analysis from 6 to 52 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There was no significant difference in the rate of recurrent myomas laparoscopic and open myomectomy (20 versus 18 percent; OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.4-3.0), although this analysis also lacked statistical power. Interestingly, some data suggest that a laparoscopic approach results in less severe adhesive disease, particularly fewer adnexal adhesions, which may impact fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1881385\" class=\"local\">'Adhesive disease'</a> below.) Further randomized trials are needed to compare between these two procedures.</p><p>In summary, laparoscopic myomectomy is a minimally invasive procedure with a shorter recovery and a lower overall risk of complications than abdominal myomectomy. More data are needed about the comparative risks of major complications and fibroid persistence or recurrence. Patient eligibility and access to trained surgeons limit the availability of this procedure. Given the available data, we suggest laparoscopic rather than open myomectomy for women with leiomyomas when technically feasible (depending upon size, number, and location) and who have easy access to a surgeon with advanced laparoscopic skills.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10497672\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative laparoscopic techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1198933\"><span class=\"h3\">Robot-assisted laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Robot-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy may decrease technical difficulty by making laparoscopic suturing easier than during conventional laparoscopic procedures. However, use of robot-assisted laparoscopy is expensive, and, currently, there are fewer surgeons with expertise in robot-assisted than in conventional laparoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Robot-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy is associated with decreased blood loss and recovery time compared with open myomectomy, but appears to increase operative duration, based upon observational data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>]. As an example, in one case-control study (n = 125), robotic-assisted compared with open procedures had a significant decrease in blood loss (226 versus 459 ml), change in postoperative hematocrit (5.1 versus 7.1 percent), length of hospital stay (0.5 versus 3.3 days), number of days to regular diet (0.9 versus 2.3 days), and febrile morbidity (1.3 percent versus 38 percent), despite significantly longer robotic surgical times (3.2 versus 2.3 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>There are few data comparing robot-assisted with conventional laparoscopic myomectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. In the largest study to-date, a retrospective case series of 575 myomectomies (68.3 percent open, 16.2 percent conventional laparoscopic, and 5.5 percent robot-assisted) reported that robotic-assisted myomectomy was associated with blood loss (robot-assisted: 150mL and conventional laparoscopic: 100mL) and operative duration (181 and 155 minutes) that were comparable to conventional laparoscopic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Case selection bias is likely in retrospective studies, however, which makes these low-quality data.</p><p>Some data suggest that obesity is not associated with poor surgical outcomes in patients undergoing robotic myomectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>It is not known whether robotic technology results in a more secure myometrial closure, and thus, in a lower risk of subsequent uterine rupture; there is only one report of pregnancy after a robot-assisted myomectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although robotic technology facilitates laparoscopic suturing, the lack of haptic (tactile) feedback may limit the ability to hold tension on a suture. However, the third operative arm instrument enables the surgeon to hold tension on the suture while he or she sutures with the other arms. Additionally, recently introduced barbed sutures (eg, Quill Self-Retaining System, V-Loc Absorbable Wound Closure Device) facilitate suture fixation in myometrial tissue during both robotic and laparoscopic myomectomy, also decreasing the need to hold tension on sutures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The technique involved the placement of three 5 mm trocars through a common umbilical incision, but through separate fascial perforations. A harmonic scalpel and blunt dissection were used to remove a 4 cm transmural posterior fundal myoma and the uterine defect was repaired in layers using bidirectional barbed suture. After removal of the trocars, a fascial incision connecting the perforations was made to facilitate removal of the myoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26569406\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative evaluation and preparation are similar for laparoscopic and abdominal myomectomy.

Failure to adequately suture myometrial defects, lack of hemostasis within uterine defects with subsequent hematoma formation, or the excessive use electrosurgery with devascularization of the myometrium have all been postulated to interfere with myometrial wound healing and increase the potential for rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>In the largest study of laparoscopic myomectomy, 2050 women followed for an average of 42 months, there were 386 pregnancies and one uterine rupture (spontaneous rupture at 33 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Laparoscopic myolysis has been performed using a number of energy sources, including bipolar electrosurgery, Nd:YAG laser, radiofrequency, and cryogenic probes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. </p><p>Radiofrequency myolysis is easier to master than laparoscopic myomectomy, since it does not require laparoscopic suturing.

(See <a href=\"#H7666316\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common indications for laparoscopic myomectomy are abnormal uterine bleeding or bulk-related symptoms (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">pelvic/abdominal</span> pain or pressure). Indications for which the benefit of laparoscopic (or abdominal) myomectomy is unproven or not likely to be helpful include evaluation of pelvic malignancy (eg, ovarian or uterine cancer), infertility, and prevention of obstetric complications. (See <a href=\"#H2968903\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2968910\" class=\"local\">'Unproven indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determining whether a woman is a candidate for laparoscopic myomectomy depends upon the location, size, and number of leiomyomas. Pedunculated subserosal fibroids are the easiest to remove, but myomas in other locations can also be excised laparoscopically. Performing laparoscopic myomectomy in women with large or numerous myomas is likely to be time consuming, particularly since morcellation is usually required. (See <a href=\"#H3730094\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for laparoscopic myomectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest laparoscopic rather than abdominal myomectomy for women with leiomyomas for whom laparoscopic removal is technically feasible (by size, number, and location) and who have access to a surgeon with advanced laparoscopic skills (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3730101\" class=\"local\">'Laparoscopic versus open myomectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of uterine rupture in a pregnancy subsequent to laparoscopic myomectomy is not well established. To optimize myometrial wound repair, we limit the use of electrosurgical desiccation of bleeding vessels and use a multi-layered closure of myometrium. (See <a href=\"#H26570231\" class=\"local\">'Measures to reduce blood loss'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26570330\" class=\"local\">'Closure of uterine defects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3565445\" class=\"local\">'Uterine rupture during pregnancy following myomectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative laparoscopic techniques for treatment of leiomyomas have been investigated. For women with symptomatic leiomyomas:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest laparoscopic myomectomy rather than laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion or myolysis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest uterine artery embolization rather than laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H432882\" class=\"local\">'Alternative laparoscopic techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common complications of laparoscopic myomectomy are hemorrhage, fever, and conversion to laparotomy. Visceral injury and other complications occur rarely. (See <a href=\"#H1390846\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following laparoscopic myomectomy, the five-year rate of persistent or new myomas is approximately 53 percent, but the rate of women undergoing reoperation is approximately 7 percent. (See <a href=\"#H1881843\" class=\"local\">'Persistent or new myomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Robotic myomectomy may benefit some surgeons who have difficulty with laparoscopic suturing, but there are no data to show meaningful benefit to women over the outcomes achieved with laparoscopic myomectomy.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-myomectomy-and-other-laparoscopic-treatments-for-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Baird DD, Dunson DB, Hill MC, et al.
