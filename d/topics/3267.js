Vector-borne transmission occurs exclusively in the Americas, where an estimated 6 million people are infected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58263\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58263 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Historically, the disease occurred predominantly in rural areas of Latin America where residents of infested houses are continuously exposed to vector bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. The prevalence of <em>T. cruzi</em> is highest in Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Guatemala [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology of Chagas disease is changing due to migration of individuals within and outside of endemic countries as well as successful programs to reduce transmission in endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The following factors have altered the epidemiology of Chagas disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massive rural to urban migration within Latin America</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>International migration of persons from Chagas disease&ndash;endemic areas to Europe and the United States</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rise of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Success of vector control in many areas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure of vector control and emergence of insecticide resistance, especially in the Gran Chaco</p><p/><p>There are a number of consequences of these trends. Hundreds of thousands of infected individuals live in cities across Latin America and in the United States, Spain, and other European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In Santa Cruz (the largest city in Bolivia), <em>T. cruzi</em> infection is found in 15 to 20 percent of pregnant women presenting for delivery and up to 60 percent of patients with heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. An estimated 300,000 infected immigrants are thought to be living in the United States; the prevalence of Chagas disease among Latin American&ndash;born residents of Los Angeles County was estimated to be 1.24 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. In studies of Latin American immigrants presenting to healthcare facilities with cardiac disease, the prevalence of <em>T. cruzi</em> infection has ranged from 5 to 19 percent and is highest in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. Because of infection prevalence and immigration patterns, <em>T. cruzi</em> infection in the United States is most commonly found in immigrants from El Salvador and Mexico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At least 40,000 infected individuals live in Spain; the largest affected group are immigrants from Bolivia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/7,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15</a>].</p><p>In a study including more than 14 million units of blood screened between January 2007 and June 2008 in the United States, the overall seroprevalence was 1:27,500; the highest seroprevalence rates were observed in Florida and California [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Of 104 <em>T. cruzi</em>&ndash;infected donors identified, 28 percent were born in Mexico, 26 percent in the United States, 16 percent in El Salvador, and 11 percent in Bolivia; the remaining donors were born in 9 other Central and South American countries. Among infected donors born in the United States, 37 percent reported no specific risk factors for <em>T. cruzi</em> infection; all reported outdoor activities in the southern United States, suggesting autochthonous exposure to the infected vector or animal reservoirs. A subsequent study using blood bank screening data suggests that 5 to 7 percent of <em>T. cruzi</em>&ndash;infected blood donors may have been infected through local vector-borne transmission in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>An additional consequence of these migration patterns is congenital and organ-derived transmission of <em>T. cruzi</em> in areas without vector-borne transmission. Congenital infections have been detected in the United States, Spain, and Switzerland, and transplant transmission of <em>T. cruzi</em> infection has occurred in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>].</p><p>Movement of <em>T. cruzi</em>&ndash;infected individuals to cities has resulted in a rise in HIV coinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Reactivation of Chagas disease in HIV-coinfected patients has been described in Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>].</p><p>The success of vector control means that formerly endemic areas of Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia no longer have domestic and peridomestic vector-borne transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Congenital transmission therefore accounts for a greater proportion of new infections than in the past; in 2015, the Pan American Health Organization estimated that 77 percent of incident infections are due to vectorial transmission compared with 22 percent by congenital transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Insecticide resistance and failure of vector control methods in the Gran Chaco region of Bolivia, Argentina, and Paraguay means that this area still experiences the highest incidence of <em>T. cruzi</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In much of this area, more than half of the rural population is infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Innovative approaches are needed to address vector control, etiological treatment, and management of Chagas heart disease in this region.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H591899160\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vector-borne transmission via infected triatomine bugs is the major route of Chagas disease transmission. Transmission can also occur vertically from mother to fetus, via transfusion of infected blood components, via transplantation of an organ from an infected donor, via ingestion of contaminated food or drink, or via laboratory exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the absence of successful antitrypanosomal treatment, infection is lifelong; spontaneous cure is extremely rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1618493519\"><span class=\"h2\">Vector transmission and life cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vector-borne transmission via infected triatomine bugs is the major route of Chagas transmission (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53632\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53632 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66260\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66260 \">picture 1</a>). In Mexico, Central America, and northern South America, the main vectors are <em>Rhodnius prolixus</em> and <em>Triatoma dimidiata</em>. In Brazil, Bolivia, and farther south, the main domestic vector is <em>Triatoma infestans</em>. <em>Panstrongylus megistus</em> is an important domestic vector in Brazil and is found as a sylvatic vector in Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73573 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The infective trypomastigote form of the <em>T. cruzi </em>parasite is present in large numbers in the feces of infected triatomine bugs. During or immediately after a blood meal, the triatomine bug defecates on the skin of the host, allowing the organism to enter through the bite wound. The organism can also enter via intact conjunctiva or mucous membranes. Most domestic triatomine species feed nocturnally and are able to complete their blood meal without awakening the host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology of vector-borne <em>T. cruzi</em> is closely linked to the biological and ecological characteristics of the triatomine vectors and the reservoir hosts (including both domestic and sylvatic mammals). The triatomine passes through five nymphal stages; only the adults are winged. Triatomine bugs of both sexes must take blood meals to develop through their nymphal stages to adults. In addition, females require blood meals to lay eggs. Thus, both nymphs and adults may be infected with <em>T. cruzi</em>, but infection rates increase with development stage and age.</p><p><em>T. cruzi</em> infection is transmitted to wild mammals by sylvatic triatomine species; these bugs often colonize the nests of rodent or marsupial reservoir hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Sylvatic triatomine adults may fly into human dwellings and cause sporadic human infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Domestic transmission occurs in settings where triatomine vectors have become adapted to living in human dwellings and nearby animal enclosures. Domestic mammals such as dogs, cats, and guinea pigs play important roles as triatomine blood meal sources and <em>T. cruzi</em> reservoir hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Some triatomine species can infest both domestic and sylvatic sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Triatomines also may feed on blood from birds and reptiles, but these animals are not susceptible to <em>T. cruzi</em> infection.</p><p>There are more than 130 triatomine bug species in the Americas, many of which can transmit <em>T. cruzi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. A small number of highly domiciliated vectors are of disproportionate importance in the human epidemiology of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73573 \">table 2</a>). Poor-quality housing with adobe or unfinished brick walls provides crevices and other hiding places for triatomine bugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Roofs made of thatch are an attractive habitat for several species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Domestic infestation rates in endemic areas can be high (eg, 25 to 100 percent of houses infested). A house and its immediate surroundings may support large colonies of both juvenile and adult bugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/39,40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40,42</a>].</p><p>In endemic settings, <em>T. cruzi</em> infection is usually acquired in childhood. Infection persists for life, so the seroprevalence in an area with sustained vector-borne transmission increases with age (reflecting cumulative incidence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/29,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,43</a>]. Before widespread vector control was instituted in the early 1990s, more than 60 percent of adults were infected with <em>T. cruzi</em> in some endemic communities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/42,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,44</a>]. Cross-sectional community surveys have demonstrated that most infected individuals are asymptomatic (have the indeterminate form); an estimated 70 to 80 percent remain asymptomatic throughout their lives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/5,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,45</a>]. The prevalence of clinical disease increases with age, reflecting onset of cardiac and gastrointestinal manifestations in early adulthood with progression over a period of years to decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>The southern region of the United States has established enzootic cycles of <em>T. cruzi</em> involving several triatomine vector species and mammalian hosts, such as raccoons, opossums, and domestic dogs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>]. Autochthonous vector-borne infections in humans have been reported in Texas, California, Tennessee, and Louisiana [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/52-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-58</a>]. The rarity of vector-borne transmission in the United States has been attributed to housing conditions that minimize vector-human contact and lower transmission efficiency of the North American vectors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/53,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,59</a>]. However, undetected cases of autochthonous vector-borne transmission certainly occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1618493691\"><span class=\"h2\">Vertical transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An estimated 22 percent of new Chagas infections occur through mother-to-child transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Congenital transmission can occur via women who themselves were infected congenitally, perpetuating the disease in the absence of the vector [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>The transmission rates from infected mothers to infants is approximately 1 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/8,61-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,61-67</a>]. The low sensitivity of neonatal screening tests combined with low follow-up rates later in infancy may lead to substantial underestimation of the transmission rate; one study estimated that only half of all infected infants are detected by routine screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Factors that increase the risk of congenital transmission include high level of maternal parasitemia (women with negative polymerase chain reaction results are very unlikely to transmit to their infants), younger maternal age, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/8,61,66,68-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,61,66,68-73</a>].</p><p>Congenital transmission has been reported in the United States and in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/18,19,21,66,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,21,66,74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4209508624\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral transmission of acute <em>T. cruzi</em> infection can occur via ingestion of food or drink contaminated by infected triatomine bugs or their feces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].

Serological screening of blood components for <em>T. cruzi</em> has become accepted as an important component of Chagas disease control initiatives and is now compulsory in all endemic countries (although compliance is variable) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. Since this intervention, the risk of transmission via blood transfusion has diminished greatly but has not been eliminated; in such regions, the risk of transmission is estimated to be 1:200,000 units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/81,84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,84,85</a>].</p><p>Transfusion transmission has been reported in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/86-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-89</a>].

Vector-borne transmission in poor housing conditions occurs exclusively in the Americas, where an estimated 6 to 8 million people are infected. The epidemiology of the disease is changing due to successful reduction of transmission in endemic areas as well as migration of individuals within and outside of endemic areas. Hundreds of thousands of infected individuals live in cities across Latin America and in the United States, Spain, and other European countries. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infective trypomastigote form of the <em>T. cruzi</em> parasite is present in large numbers in the feces of infected triatomine bugs. During or immediately after a blood meal, the triatomine bug defecates on the skin of the host, allowing the organism to enter through the bite wound or via intact conjunctiva or mucous membranes. The risk of infection in the setting of short-term exposure is low; mathematical models estimate that, on average, 900 to 4000 contacts with infected vectors are needed to result in infection. (See <a href=\"#H1618493519\" class=\"local\">'Vector transmission and life cycle'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1933009579\" class=\"local\">'Risk to travelers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In endemic areas, <em>T. cruzi</em> infection is usually acquired in childhood and persists for life. Therefore, the seroprevalence in an area with sustained vector-borne transmission increases with age (reflecting cumulative incidence). Before widespread vector control was instituted, more than 60 percent of adults were infected with <em>T. cruzi</em> in some endemic communities. About 70 to 80 percent of infected individuals have lifelong asymptomatic infection. The prevalence of clinical disease increases with age, reflecting onset of cardiac and gastrointestinal manifestations in early adulthood with progression over a period of years to decades. (See <a href=\"#H1618493519\" class=\"local\">'Vector transmission and life cycle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chagas disease transmission can also occur vertically from mother to fetus, via transfusion of infected blood components, via organ transplantation from an infected donor, via ingestion of contaminated food or drink, or via laboratory exposure. In the United States, voluntary blood bank screening was initiated in 2007 and is estimated to cover 75 to 90 percent of the blood supply. (See <a href=\"#H591899160\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most congenitally infected infants are asymptomatic or have nonspecific signs; specific laboratory screening is needed to detect congenital infections in infants. Several endemic countries have congenital Chagas disease screening programs; however, only a small proportion of at-risk infants complete all steps of the algorithm. (See <a href=\"#H1618493691\" class=\"local\">'Vertical transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transmission by domestic vectors has been reduced via residual application of long-lasting insecticides in human dwellings and peridomestic structures. Despite this progress, foci of vector-borne transmission persist in most endemic countries of Latin America.
