MM is distinguished from premalignant plasma cell dyscrasias, namely monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), by the presence of organ dysfunction (anemia, hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, infection, and skeletal lesions) attributed to the malignant clone. Patients with MM are given therapies directed at the underlying plasma cell clone with the goal of preventing further complications. In contrast, active treatment is not routinely indicated for patients with MGUS or SMM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT, rescue) is considered a standard of care for eligible patients with newly diagnosed MM. However, access to autologous HCT is limited in certain areas of the world by age restrictions or resource limitations. In a similar vein, while initial therapy has shifted towards using immunomodulatory drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>) and proteasome inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>) as initial therapy, these drugs may not be available in resource-poor settings.</p><p>The selection of initial treatment regimen for patients with MM in resource-poor settings is discussed here. The general approach to therapy of MM, including diagnostic evaluation, risk stratification, details regarding the use and timing of autologous HCT, and the response evaluation, is presented separately, as is the selection of initial treatment for patients with MM in other settings.

In addition, high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT, rescue) is considered a standard of care for eligible patients with newly diagnosed MM. However, access to autologous HCT and novel agents is limited in certain areas of the world by age restrictions or resource limitations. Patients in such settings can still benefit from the use of treatment regimens that are based on alkylating agents (eg, melphalan) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> first generation immunomodulatory agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>). Details regarding the use of these regimens and guidance regarding the choice of regimen are provided in the following sections. More modern regimens are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial chemotherapy for symptomatic multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to the development of effective therapies, median overall survival was less than one year among patients with symptomatic MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-multiple-myeloma-in-resource-poor-settings/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. MP improved median overall survival of such patients to approximately three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-multiple-myeloma-in-resource-poor-settings/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> to the MP regimen resulted in an even longer median overall survival of approximately four years.</p><p>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> has declined in much of the world due to concerns of toxicity, and the availability of more effective regimens. Melphalan is associated with damage to the hematopoietic stem cell compartment as well as an increased risk of myelodysplasia following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-multiple-myeloma-in-resource-poor-settings/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As such, melphalan-based regimens are <strong>not</strong> an appropriate choice for patients who are eligible for HCT. Given these concerns about melphalan, many of the immunomodulatory drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>) and proteasome inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>) used in patients with MM were initially studied in HCT candidates. Given the high response rates and good tolerability, many clinicians have shifted towards using these as initial therapy for patients who are not eligible for HCT as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial chemotherapy for symptomatic multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following sections will present data regarding the administration, efficacy, and toxicity of melphalan-based regimens and other regimens that are not commonly used but may be considered in patients who do not have access to or are ineligible for HCT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8888482\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of regimen in resource-poor settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with MM can be categorized as having standard-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk disease based on the results of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for specific translocations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deletions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78344\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78344 \">table 1</a>). If FISH is unavailable, conventional cytogenetics can be used as an alternative but is much less sensitive. Our preferred initial treatment regimen for patients with MM depends on this baseline risk stratification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97453\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97453 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial chemotherapy for symptomatic multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment options available in resource-poor settings are variable and so a final decision regarding the best available care must be individualized. For our purposes, we will assume a treatment setting that has limited access to autologous HCT, immunomodulatory drugs, and proteasome inhibitors. The following general principles apply:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous HCT is considered a standard of care for eligible patients with newly diagnosed myeloma. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Melphalan</a> is an active drug in myeloma but is associated with damage to the hematopoietic stem cell compartment as well as an increased risk of myelodysplasia following transplantation.

There are several other regimens that can be used in settings where there is limited access to lenalidomide. Most of these carry a greater risk of side effects or are less effective than Rd and VRd. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Melphalan</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (MP) is a well-studied oral regimen.

VMP (bortezomib, melphalan, prednisone) is an equally good option, but if access to bortezomib is not a problem, VCd (bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone) is a similar regimen with a less toxic, equally effective alkylator (cyclophosphamide). In contrast, for these patients Td and VAD are best avoided; in a randomized trial, Td had inferior survival compared with MP in the older adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-multiple-myeloma-in-resource-poor-settings/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Intermediate-risk patients were previously considered to have high-risk disease, but treatment with proteasome inhibitor-containing regimens has resulted in outcomes approaching that of standard-risk patients. The outcome of patients with high-risk myeloma has not improved significantly even with the arrival of new agents. If proteasome inhibitors are not available, other regimens (eg, melphalan, prednisone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>) are administered with the understanding that responses will likely be short-lived.

However, access to autologous HCT is limited in certain areas of the world by age restrictions or resource limitations. In a similar vein, while initial therapy has shifted toward using immunomodulatory drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>) and proteasome inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>) as initial therapy, these drugs may not be available in resource-poor settings.

The principal characteristics that determine eligibility for HCT are age, performance status, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence and severity of certain comorbid conditions. Melphalan-based therapy should <strong>not</strong> be used for patients who plan to undergo HCT.

Adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> as a third agent (MPT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53179\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53179 \">table 5</a>) improves survival at the expense of increased toxicity. VMP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, melphalan, prednisone) is at least an equally good option as MPT. However, if bortezomib is available, VCd (bortezomib, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>) is similar to VMP, but with a less toxic, equally effective alkylator (cyclophosphamide). For patients who do <strong>not</strong> have access to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> and bortezomib but do have access to HCT, we suggest induction therapy with thalidomide plus dexamethasone rather than infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and dexamethasone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

Intermediate-risk patients were previously considered to have high-risk disease, but treatment with proteasome inhibitor-containing regimens has resulted in outcomes approaching that of standard-risk patients.
