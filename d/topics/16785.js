As more knowledge is gained, it is apparent that these subsets represent the tip of the iceberg in the multiple checks and balances that are characteristic of the immune system. After the discovery of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Th1/Th2</span> dichotomy, most research was dedicated to understanding their cytokine polarization. The emphasis then shifted to examining the signals required for <span class=\"nowrap\">Th1/Th2</span> differentiation. The focus then shifted yet again to examining the role of dendritic cell (DC) subsets, rediscovered regulatory T cells, and newly discovered T helper type 17 (Th17) cells in modulating immune responses. The next wave of research in this area may yield insight not only into the modulation of T helper subsets but into potential therapeutic manipulation of these subsets in human disease.</p><p>There is detailed understanding of the modulation of T helper cell responses in mice. However, data in humans are less complete, and the exact characteristics of Th17 cells and T regulatory (Treg) cells are still being determined. This topic will focus on human immunology, using murine studies only to clarify a point, and will elucidate the known characteristics of these subsets, their differentiation, and their involvement in various diseases. Other details of cellular immunity are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Categorization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T cells can be categorized based upon cell surface expression of either cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) or CD8. CD4+ cells recognize antigen presented in the context of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC), while CD8+ cells recognize antigen presented in the context of class I MHC.</p><p>CD4+ T helper subsets include T helper type 1 (Th1), T helper type 2 (Th2), and T helper type 17 (Th17) cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58150\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58150 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F101256\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101256 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is evidence that each of these subsets is involved in the defense against a certain subset of micro-organisms. Th1 are pivotal in defense against intracellular micro-organisms in general and mycobacteria in particular. Patients with mutations in the interferon (IFN)-gamma receptor or interleukin (IL)-12 receptor present with recurrent infections with mycobacteria and <em>Salmonella</em>. Th2 cells are integral in expelling parasitic infestations. Th17 seem to play a significant role in defense against extracellular bacteria and some fungi. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases: Specific defects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Th1 and Th17 cells play major roles in autoimmunity, whereas Th2 cells are the hallmark of atopic disease. T regulatory (Treg) cells represent a major subset of CD4+ T cells that may be involved in regulating and attenuating the activity of the three T helper subsets.</p><p>Of note, in vitro generation of a single T helper subset is possible since culture conditions are such that they favor the development of that particular subset while suppressing other subsets. In patients, however, the polarization of T helper subsets is not absolute, and other subsets are present at the same time. It is more appropriate to assign T helper subset preponderance, rather than polarization, when one is talking about lymphocyte responses in patients. In addition, several studies have shown &quot;flexibility&quot; in a T cell phenotype. In one such study, priming a single human T cell with two pathogens (<em>Candida albicans</em> and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>) and tetanus toxin in vitro gave rise to a variety of T helper subsets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Historic perspective</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a seminal observation, it was established that murine CD4 clones could be divided into two major categories defined by the cytokines they secreted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. One subset, designated Th1, secreted IL-2, IFN-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-beta. The other subset, designated Th2, secreted IL-4 and IL-5. Some cytokines (TNF-alpha, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) were secreted by both subsets.</p><p>These subsets also had functional differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Th1 cells were involved in the generation of cellular immunity, including delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) differentiation. Both subsets appeared to be involved in antibody generation, but Th2 cells were exclusively involved in class-switching to immunoglobulin E (IgE).</p><p>Since those seminal observations, the function and involvement of Th1 and Th2 cells in disease have been further refined, and a third T helper subset, Th17, has been identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional differences of T helper subsets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T helper subsets secrete different cytokines that are able to modulate various immune responses. The cytokines secreted by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells may be responsible for their functional roles. The understanding of the various cytokines involved in T helper subsets is not complete and continues to evolve. Nevertheless, each T helper subset has a unique pattern of dominant cytokines, with other cytokines playing significant, but hitherto not well documented, roles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Cytokine profiles'</a> below.)</p><p>Th1 cells secrete IFN-gamma and therefore are poised to activate macrophages and help in the eradication of intracellular micro-organisms, such as mycobacteria. Th1 cells also promote cytotoxic T cell development and DTH reactions. Hence, Th1 cells are proinflammatory and may be involved in the pathogenesis and maintenance of some autoimmune diseases.</p><p>Th2 cells, by virtue of their IL-4 and IL-13 secretion, are important in the promotion of IgE synthesis. They help mediate immunity against parasitic infestations and are pivotal in the development of allergy and asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Th17 cells secrete IL-17, which induces production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and recruits neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Th17 cells appear to be involved in the early response to numerous extracellular pathogens, including bacteria and fungi, and play an important role in autoimmunity and tissue inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. They may also play a role in the neutrophil, rather than eosinophil, predominant forms of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Other T helper subsets have a role in tolerance rather than immunity. These include type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells (secrete IL-10), T helper type 3 (Th3) cells (secrete transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta), and Treg cells (secrete IL-10 and TGF-beta). The biologic relevance of these subsets is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Modulation by regulatory T cells'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional T helper subsets continue to be discovered. These include T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, T helper type 9 (Th9) cells, and T helper type 22 (Th22) cells. The Tfh cell subset is preponderant in the germinal centers and is believed to play a major role in helping B cells make antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In mice, Tfh cells differentiate in response to IL-6, IL-21, and type I interferon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Tfh development is mediated by transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6) and inhibited by transcription factor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. This T helper subset differentiates from Th2 cells in reactive lymph nodes in response to helminth infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In humans, on the other hand, it appears that IL-12 may be crucial to Tfh development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Human Tfh cells have received extensive scrutiny, and a clearer picture of their regulation and function is emerging, although still far from clear. In short, it appears Tfh are important in supporting the differentiation of antigen-specific B cells into memory and plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Circulating human Tfh express high levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR5 (cysteine-X-cysteine motif receptor 5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Perhaps the best illustration of the importance of Tfh came from studies of antibody response to immunization with H1N1 (hemagglutinin 1 and neuraminidase 1) influenza vaccine. Successful induction of H1N1-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody correlated with the induction of IL-21 in the serum and increased frequency of circulating CD4+CXCR5+ cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. There are many studies breaking Tfh-circulating cells into subsets that have features of Th1, Th2, or Th17 cells, but additional studies are needed to clarify this apparent complexity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Th9 cells are believed to be induced in the presence of TGF-beta and IL-4 and are characterized by the secretion of IL-9 and IL-10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Th9 development is mediated by transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and PU.1 (binds to a purine-rich DNA sequence called the PU-box) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Functionally, Th9 are thought to be important in resistance to parasites and may be involved in asthma and other allergic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Most of the Th9 studies have been done in mice.</p><p>It is thought that na&iuml;ve CD4 cells, in the presence of TNF-alpha and IL-6, develop into Th22 cells that secrete IL-22 and TNF-alpha. These cells may be involved in epidermal immunity and remodeling in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. It is not yet clear as to whether Th22 are a distinct lineage or whether they are a subset of Th17, since Th17 can also secrete IL-22 and TNF-alpha. Evidence suggests that Th22 cells are in involved in atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, scleroderma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and squamous cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokine profiles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T helper subsets were initially described in mice. It took several years before a similar division in humans was firmly established, albeit with less clear-cut polarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There is general agreement that the cytokines produced by T helper subsets segregate as detailed in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58150\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58150 \">figure 1</a>). IFN-gamma is the major cytokine secreted by Th1 cells, IL-4 is the cardinal marker of Th2 cells, and secretion of IL-17 defines Th17 cells. Initially it was thought that IL-2 was produced exclusively by Th1 cells. Evidence suggests that IL-2 may be important in the maintenance of Th2 cells, expansion of memory Th17 cells, and induction of Treg cells as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>There have been numerous attempts at finding a unique surface marker that is expressed exclusively on each T helper subset. Since these subsets secrete and respond to distinct cytokines, a logical approach was to examine their expression of cytokine receptors. Th1 cells express both chains of the IL-12 receptor (IL-12-R-beta-1 and IL-12-R-beta-2), while Th2 and Th17 cells seem to express only IL-12-R-beta-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/6,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,39</a>]. Th2 cells also express IL-4 receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Th17 cells express the IL-23 receptor, a heterodimer comprised of IL-12-R-beta-1 and a unique IL-23-R chain, in addition to receptors for IL-6, IL-21, and TGF-beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/6,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,41</a>].</p><p>T helper subsets may be differentiated by their chemokine receptors. Specific chemokine receptors are expressed on the three T helper subsets. CXCR3 (cysteine-X-cysteine motif receptor 3) and CCR5 (cysteine-cysteine motif receptor 5) are expressed by Th1 cells. CCR3, CCR8, and CCR10 are expressed by Th2 cells. CCR2 and CCR6 are expressed by Th17 cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/6,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,42-44</a>]. However, the expression of these markers does not appear to be exclusive, universal, or stable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">T HELPER CELL DIFFERENTIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The processes leading to maturation along the various pathways are not well understood. The existence of a T helper type 0 (Th0) precursor (a T helper cell that produces both T helper type 1 [Th1] and T helper type 2 [Th2] cytokines) is well documented in vitro but is not well delineated in vivo. Most studies suggest that early reports of Th0 cells were most likely a mixed Th1 and Th2 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>The pathway of T cell differentiation is determined by antigens, antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and the cytokine milieu, as shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58150\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58150 \">figure 1</a>). Antigen is taken up by APCs, most commonly dendritic cells (DCs). DCs process the antigen and present it to na&iuml;ve CD4+ T cells. Two signals are needed for T cell activation: ligation of the T cell receptor to class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and a costimulatory signal (CD28 binding of <span class=\"nowrap\">CD80/CD86)</span>. T cell activation proceeds intracellularly via signaling and activation molecules. <span class=\"nowrap\">Th1/Th2</span> balance can be influenced at each step of the above cascade. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;, section on 'Antigen-presenting cells'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;, section on 'T cell activation'</a>.)</p><p>One type or subset of T helper cell typically dominates, but there is not complete polarization. In addition, there is plasticity in the system, in that one type of T helper cell may differentiate into another type of T helper cell. (See <a href=\"#H15633800\" class=\"local\">'Interaction of T helper subsets'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Modulation by antigen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In mouse models, T helper differentiation is modulated by several factors related to the antigen, including dose, affinity, type of antigen, and length of stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. In general, smaller doses of antigen and alum adjuvants are more likely to induce Th2 responses, whereas larger doses of antigen and mycobacterial adjuvants (Freund's adjuvant) are more likely to induce Th1 responses.</p><p>It is not yet clear whether T helper differentiation is similarly modulated in humans, especially since alum is the most common adjuvant used in human vaccines. Mycobacterial adjuvants are not used in human vaccines. However, experimental data using CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) oligodeoxynucleotides, which are derived from mycobacterial DNA fragments and bind to toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), seem to support the induction of Th1 responses in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Some vaccines (eg, human papilloma virus vaccine) contain monophosphoryl lipid A, a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand, as an adjuvant, but its effect on polarization of T helper subsets is not well examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Modulation by cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differentiation of na&iuml;ve CD4 cells along a particular T helper subset pathway or a T regulatory (Treg) cell fate is influenced by multiple cytokines, signaling molecules, and transcription factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. For each subset, there is a dominant cytokine that sets the stage for the initial polarization by activation of a characteristic transcription factor. This initial polarization is followed by an amplification loop that also involves a dominant cytokine and a dominant transcription factor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58150\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58150 \">figure 1</a>). This is a simplified model. Each passing day brings the description of a new cytokine or modulator that complicates the picture further, especially for T helper type 17 (Th17).</p><p>Interleukin (IL)-12 is the dominant initial cytokine for the differentiation of Th1 cells. IL-12 is secreted by DCs and binds to IL-12 receptor (IL-12-R-beta-2) on na&iuml;ve CD4+ T cells, resulting in the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4). STAT4 activates the transcription factor T-bet (also called TBX21 or T-box 21), which induces the secretion of interferon (IFN)-gamma. IFN-gamma acts as an amplifier by binding to its receptor on Th1 cells and activating STAT1, which then engages T-bet. IL-12 also induces natural killer (NK) cells to secrete IFN-gamma, which further promotes Th1 development. This pathway links innate and adaptive immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>]. IL-18 acts in synergy with IL-12 to promote Th1 responses as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. Type 1 interferons (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta), which are secreted by DCs, can also induce maturation along the Th1 pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p>The most important cytokine in the development of Th2 responses is IL-4. IL-4 can be secreted by several cells including T cells, mast cells, eosinophils, and natural killer T (NKT) cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/63-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-68</a>]. The role of IL-4 in Th2 development is not as well delineated as the role of IL-12 in Th1 development. It appears that IL-4 acts as its own amplification loop. IL-4 activates STAT6, which then engages the transcription factor GATA3 (guanine-adenine-thymine-adenine binding protein 3), leading to secretion of IL-4. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelial cell cytokine that also promotes the development of na&iuml;ve T helper cells into inflammatory Th2 cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>].</p><p>Differentiation of human na&iuml;ve CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells requires exposure to IL-1-beta and IL-6 or IL-1-beta and IL-21, although it appears that IL-6 stimulation is the dominant pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/6,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,71</a>]. IL-1, IL-21, and IL-6 all activate STAT3, which engages the transcription factor ROR gamma t (retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma, thymus-specific isoform). This leads to secretion of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-21. IL-21 then amplifies Th17 proliferation. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the gene for ROR gamma t (<em>RORC</em>) result in absence of IL-17 producing T cells and a clinical phenotype of recurrent candidiasis and mycobacteriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. STAT1 gain-of-function mutations are also associated with decreased production of IL-17 and a defect in Th17 responses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis#H8501601\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis&quot;, section on 'STAT1 defects associated with CMCC'</a>.)</p><p>IL-23 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta may also be required for Th17 differentiation and IL-17 production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In a murine study, it was found that Th17 cells induced by TGF-beta-3 in addition to IL-6 and IL-23 are highly pathogenic, whereas Th17 cells induced by TGF-beta-1 and IL-6 are not pathogenic unless they have further prolonged exposure to IL-23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Initial TGF-beta-3 production is induced by IL-6, but IL-23 is required for continued TGF-beta-3 expression. While IL-7 is not required for Th17 differentiation, it is essential for expansion and survival of pathogenic Th17 cells in a mouse model of autoimmunity and in humans with multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Th17 cells are an important part of the adaptive immunity but may not be the only, or the most important, source of IL-17. Extensive literature in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>] suggests that several innate immunity cell types are major producers of IL-17 and therefore function as sentinels of the immune system, particularly in mucosal barriers. These cell types include gamma-delta T cells, invariant NKT cells, NK cells, Paneth cells in the small intestine epithelium, and lymphoid tissue-inducer (LTi) cells.</p><p>T-bet is pivotal for Th1 maturation, GATA3 for Th2 maturation, and ROR gamma t for Th17 maturation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58150\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58150 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. T-bet promotes Th1 development by direct induction of IFN-gamma and IL-12-R-beta-2 chain gene transcription. In addition, T-bet appears to inhibit IL-4, IL-5, and IL-17 secretion. T-bet may also inhibit Th2 differentiation by preventing GATA3 from interacting with its target DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

DCs are the most potent APCs. There are at least five human DC subsets. The two major functional DC subsets are DC1 and DC2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-83</a>]. DC1s are CD11c+CD123<sup>lo</sup>, while DC2s are CD11c-CD123<sup>hi</sup>. DC1 cells are thought to secrete IL-12 and type 1 IFN that polarize na&iuml;ve T cells toward Th1. DC2 cells are thought to polarize cells toward a Th2 pathway, although the detailed molecular mechanisms are not as well worked out as they are for Th1. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antigen-presenting-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antigen-presenting cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DC1 and DC2 cells arise from different precursors (plasmacytoid versus myeloid, respectively), and their differentiation may be affected by the nature of the antigen they encounter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/81-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-85</a>]. DCs express molecules known as TLRs. Each TLR recognizes a distinct pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) expressed on various micro-organisms. Monocyte-derived DCs (DC2) are more likely to express TLR3, TLR4, and TLR8. Plasmacytoid-derived DCs (DC1), on the other hand, are more likely to express TLR7 and TLR9. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toll-like receptors: Roles in disease and therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ligation of TLRs activates DCs and stimulates the production of various cytokines. Ligation of TLR9, which recognizes CpG motifs of bacterial DNA, results in the secretion of IL-12 and IFN-gamma that polarize T cells towards a Th1 differentiation pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/81-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-87</a>]. TLR ligation by parasites may induce DCs to promote Th2 responses. Ligation of TLR2 and TLR4 may also polarize differentiation along the Th2 pathway. Mouse models suggest TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 may be involved in Th17 polarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>].</p><p>Ligation of TLRs on DCs initiates a process of DC maturation: upregulating class II MHC expression, increasing surface expression of CD80 and CD86, and inducing transcription and translation of various cytokines. Depending upon the cytokines secreted, DCs can then influence maturation along Th1, Th2, Th17, or regulatory T cell pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/41,81-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,81-87</a>]. Results from a mouse model of autoimmunity suggest that Th17 differentiation also depends upon the activation of TGF-beta by integrins on DCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-92</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Modulation by regulatory T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differentiation and function of T helper subsets is subject to another level of control by a CD4+ subset whose main function is the regulation or suppression of immune response. These are the so-called regulatory T cells, or Treg cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/93-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-97</a>]. Treg cells may suppress responder na&iuml;ve T cells and effector T cells via several mechanisms including secretion of inhibitory cytokines, cytolytic enzymes, and suppressive molecules; metabolic disruption; expression of surface receptors that can affect DC function; and induction of target cell senescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/98-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-101</a>].</p><p>In mice, Treg cells can be divided into thymic or &quot;natural&quot; and peripheral or &quot;induced&quot; subsets. Natural Treg cells are CD4+CD25<sup>bright</sup> and express forkhead box P3 (Foxp3). Natural Treg cells appear to exert their effect by cell-to-cell contact with little involvement of cytokines. Induced Treg cells are generated upon activation by APCs. The older literature referred to T helper subsets that were called Tr1 (T helper that secrete high levels of IL-10) or Th3 (T helper subsets that secrete TGF-beta). These probably represent Treg cell subsets.</p><p>The best studied role of Treg cells in humans is in helminth infestation. Helminths have strong polarizing effects towards a Th2 response. However, the incidence of atopy (Th2-associated disease) is markedly decreased in geographic areas where helminth infestations are endemic. Helminths appear to induce Treg cell maturation. Treg cells secreting high levels of IL-10 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> TGF-beta were isolated from patients with onchocerciasis (a helminth infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>].</p><p>It is thought that Treg cells represent the dominant T cell response to common environmental allergens in healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The development of an allergic response can be due either to blocking a Treg pathway or enhancing a Th2 pathway. High exposure to some pets early in life might prevent immunoglobulin E (IgE) response by promoting Treg responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/84,95,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,95,104</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pets-in-the-home-impact-on-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pets in the home: Impact on allergic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There appears to be a reciprocal relationship between production of Th17 and natural Treg cells. IL-6 inhibits the generation of Treg cells, and IL-2 interferes with Th17 development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. IL-27 is involved in determining Th17 versus Treg cell production, and Treg cells inhibit Th17 polarization.</p><p>The induction and maintenance of Treg cells also seem to follow the same tenets outlined above for Th1, Th2, and Th17. The dominant cytokines for Treg induction in humans are TGF-beta and IL-2. Induction of these cytokines leads to the activation of STAT5, which engages the transcription factor Foxp3. Treg secrete IL-10, TGF-beta, and IL-35. TGF-beta acts as the amplifying cytokine for Treg cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/105,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,106</a>].

Studies suggest that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) can secrete cytokines that may impact T helper differentiation, just as cytokines secreted by T helper cells can impact ILC differentiation. Several ILC subsets mirror T helper subsets in the transcription factors used as well as the cytokines released. The major subsets are ILC1 (which use T-bet, respond to IL-12, and secrete IFN-gamma), ILC2 (which respond to IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP; use GATA-3; and produce IL-4,IL-5 and IL-13), and ILC3 (which respond to IL-1 and IL-23, use ROR-gamma t, and secrete IL-22 and IL-17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. There appears to be significant interaction between each T helper subset and its ILC equivalent. As an example, IL-4 production by ILC2 blocks Treg cell function, thereby promoting food allergy development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Modulation by glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids exert profound effects on T helper balance. Glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit <span class=\"nowrap\">Th1/Th17</span> response and upregulate <span class=\"nowrap\">Th2/Treg</span> cell response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/109,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">109,110</a>]. Glucocorticoids inhibit the secretion of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. This action is most likely mediated by the effect of glucocorticoids on APCs, resulting in the inhibition of IL-12 and, to a lesser extent, IL-18 (both of which are necessary for the induction of IFN-gamma secretion). Glucocorticoids also downregulate the expression of IL-12 receptors on T and NK cells. Glucocorticoids promote Th2 responses by acting directly on Th2 cells, upregulating IL-4 and IL-13 production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/109,111-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">109,111-114</a>].</p><p>These effects of glucocorticoids are in concordance with their clinical use as anti-inflammatory agents since Th1 cells are involved in promoting inflammatory responses. However, these effects are at odds with the clinical practice of using glucocorticoids to control extrinsic asthma (the paradigm of Th2-mediated disease). Glucocorticoids appear to have a different effect on the bronchial mucosa than they do on lymphocytes. Glucocorticoid therapy results in upregulation of IL-12 and IL-13 in bronchial cells of steroid-sensitive (but not glucocorticoid-resistant) patients with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].</p><p>One explanation of these findings is that asthma is associated with eosinophilic inflammation. Eosinophils are a source of IL-5. Glucocorticoid induction of eosinophilic apoptosis may decrease IL-5 production and thus decrease Th2 generation. Alternatively, these paradoxical effects may reflect differences between systemic and mucosal immunity, may indicate redistribution of various cell subsets, or may indicate that T helper subsets are much more complicated than a simple &quot;bipolar&quot; distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Indeed, in a mouse model, Th17 cells appeared to mediate glucocorticoid-resistant airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Modulation by the environment (the hygiene hypothesis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been a marked increase in certain diseases in the industrialized world over the past two to three decades. This near epidemic includes diseases thought to be Th1 mediated (eg, Crohn disease, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes) as well as diseases thought to be Th2 mediated (eg, allergic rhinitis and asthma). Conflicting explanations have been introduced depending upon whether a Th1- or a Th2-associated disease was being examined.</p><p>Initial theories to explain the near epidemic of asthma and atopy in the industrialized world focused on the role of early life infections in downregulation of Th2. This was supported by epidemiologic associations showing decreased incidence of asthma and atopy in children born on farms, children who attend daycare, and children who have older siblings. However, these apparently protective factors were also protective in Th1-associated diseases. Therefore, the immune mechanisms that regulate not only the maturation of each Th subset but also the overall balance and activity of each subset needed to be considered.</p><p>The leading candidates for such regulation are the regulatory T (Treg) cells. Decreased Treg cell function may be responsible for the increase in Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-associated diseases. In support of this hypothesis, geographic areas with endemic parasitic infestations tend to have a decreased incidence of both autoimmune and atopic diseases. It appears that helminth infestation may stimulate DC subsets that might preferentially induce the development of Treg cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/117-122\" class=\"abstract_t\">117-122</a>].

However, no genetic deletion of a particular cytokine has been demonstrated in T helper subsets, unlike B cells that undergo gene deletion when they commit to an isotype switch. A particular T helper subset secretes a dominant cytokine but can secrete other cytokines, albeit in minimal amounts, that overlap with other T helper subsets. There is some suggestion that a particular T helper subset may change &quot;type&quot; depending on its milieu. This phenomenon has been called plasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>] or multitasking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">T HELPER SUBSETS IN DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary type of T helper response to pathogens or autoantigens may determine the disease manifestation.

Mice strains that mount a Th1 response are able to control the disease, while mice strains that mount a Th2 response are more likely to succumb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p>In humans, the role of <span class=\"nowrap\">Th1/Th2</span> balance is illustrated in leprosy and thyroiditis.
