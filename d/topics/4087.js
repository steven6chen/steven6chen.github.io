Thymomas account for about 20 percent of mediastinal neoplasms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73323\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73323 \">table 1</a>). Most thymoma patients are between 40 and 60 years of age, and there is a similar incidence in men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Thoracic symptoms due to an anterior mediastinal mass are related to the size of the tumor and its effects on adjacent organs (eg, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, phrenic nerve palsy). Some patients present with superior vena cava syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancy-related superior vena cava syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Pleural or pericardial effusions are the most common manifestation of more disseminated disease and may also cause thoracic symptoms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1353927045\"><span class=\"h3\">Paraneoplastic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common paraneoplastic syndrome associated with thymoma is myasthenia gravis. However, a wide range of other autoimmune paraneoplastic syndromes have been reported, and a partial list is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96970\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96970 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Paraneoplastic syndromes may antedate the presentation with thymoma, be diagnosed concurrently with the thymic tumor, or occur after treatment (with or without evidence of tumor recurrence).</p><p>Myasthenia gravis and several other important paraneoplastic syndromes associated with thymoma are briefly discussed in this section. More detailed discussions are presented separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myasthenia gravis</strong> &ndash; Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder caused by interference with acetylcholine receptors of voluntary muscle at the neuromuscular junction. Common symptoms include diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, weakness, and fatigue.

Myasthenia gravis is common with all types of thymoma, but is rare in thymic carcinoma. Men and women are equally affected.</p><p>Patients with thymoma and myasthenia gravis usually present with less advanced disease than those without myasthenia gravis, possibly because neuromuscular symptoms may lead to an earlier diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In patients with thymoma and myasthenia gravis, thymectomy usually results in an attenuation of the severity of myasthenia gravis, although some symptoms persist in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

This paraneoplastic disorder occurs in 5 to 15 percent of patients with thymoma and is more common in older women. Pure red cell aplasia is usually seen with tumors that have spindle cell morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

Nonetheless, surgical resection of the thymoma is usually undertaken if pure red cell aplasia is found.</p><p>The management of pure red cell aplasia is discussed separately.

Conversely, up to 10 percent of patients with acquired hypogammaglobulinemia have an associated thymoma (Good syndrome), typically of spindle cell histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

As an example, in a review of 51 cases of thymoma-associated immunodeficiency, 19 patients had recurrent sinopulmonary infection, 12 had candidiasis (including 1 with candidemia), 7 had bacteremia, 12 had cytomegalovirus (only 5 with clinical manifestations), 6 had diarrhea, and several had a variety of other infections (including 3 with pneumocystis pneumonia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Patients presented with variable combinations of a morbilliform skin eruption, chronic diarrhea, and liver enzyme abnormalities. Histopathology of the skin or bowel mucosa is similar to that seen with graft-versus-host disease.

As with thymomas, most patients present with cough, chest pain, phrenic nerve palsy, or superior vena cava syndrome. Extrathoracic metastases are seen in fewer than 7 percent of patients at presentation, most commonly to the kidney, extrathoracic lymph nodes, liver, brain, adrenals, thyroid, and bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1063727683\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND STAGING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3004074549\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of a patient with an anterior mediastinal mass should include thoracic imaging (computed tomography [CT] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), which can often show whether the thymoma is well circumscribed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90540\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef90540 \">image 2</a>) or if it infiltrates surrounding structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90550\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef90550 \">image 3</a>). This imaging establishes the presence of an anterior mediastinal mass and provides the initial information to determine whether or not such a mass is resectable. The evaluation of patients with an anterior mediastinal mass is discussed separately in more detail. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass#H447433840\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a mediastinal mass&quot;, section on 'Thymoma and thymic carcinoma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass#H1883747463\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a mediastinal mass&quot;, section on 'Tissue diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Imaging findings may provide initial evidence that a tumor is thymic carcinoma rather than thymoma. Carcinomas often contain necrotic, cystic, or calcified areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F85960\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef85960 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The tumor contour is often irregular compared with thymoma, which tends to be smooth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Differences in MRI signal pattern and positron emission tomography (PET) scan appearance may also provide the initial evidence that distinguishes between thymomas and thymic carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. PET scans are often negative in more well-differentiated thymomas, but are highly positive in carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Key elements of the differential diagnosis of an anterior mediastinal mass include not only thymoma and thymic carcinoma, but also retrosternal thyroid, lymphoma, and mediastinal germ cell tumor. Thus, preoperative evaluation may include germ cell tumor markers (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] and alpha fetoprotein) and thyroid function tests, as well as pulmonary function tests.</p><p>The definitive diagnosis of a thymoma or thymic carcinoma requires a tissue diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients thought to have a thymoma that will be amenable to complete resection, the initial step in management is surgical resection, which can definitively establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1626420\" class=\"local\">'Resectable disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a tumor that is not considered amenable to complete resection or in whom surgery is contraindicated because of age or comorbidity, a tissue diagnosis with a core needle biopsy or an open biopsy is required prior to therapy.</p><p/><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) system is widely used to classify thymic neoplasms based upon their histologic appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53024\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53024 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Histologic classification may be difficult, particularly when classification is based upon a biopsy with a relatively limited amount of tissue. Furthermore, it may be impossible to determine whether a thymoma is invasive based upon a biopsy. The pathology of thymomas and thymic carcinoma is discussed in detail elsewhere and correlates with the biologic behavior of the tumor and with prognosis.

Staging of thymic neoplasms, including both thymomas and thymic carcinoma, is based upon the extent of the primary tumor and the presence of invasion into adjacent structures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dissemination. </p><p>The rationale for inclusion of thymic cancers staging in the eighth edition of the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system is to provide a common platform that will allow direct comparisons of results between different series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. For the eighth edition of the AJCC TNM staging system, data on survival outcomes of 10,808 patients were analyzed.</p><p>Other staging systems have also been used to stage thymic carcinomas, including the Masaoka staging system, which has been used in many studies and continues to be widely used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79311\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79311 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-32</a>]. In this topic, the AJCC staging system is used, unless otherwise noted. However, the majority of the data supporting treatment decisions have been based on patients staged using the Masaoka system, which is indicated when relevant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1626413\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2218541056\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized clinical trials that provide definitive guidance for the management of these patients. The following approach is consistent with guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and by the Cancer Care Ontario program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Further studies are needed to determine the indications and benefits associated with combined-modality approaches. International efforts are underway through the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group and other groups to standardize therapy definitions and reporting guidelines for thymic tumors so that more can be understood about the role of various treatments, including various doses and forms of radiotherapy (RT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1626420\"><span class=\"h3\">Resectable disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is indicated as the initial treatment for patients in whom a complete, R0 resection is considered feasible, ie, those with completely encapsulated tumors or those with tumors invading readily resectable structures, such as the mediastinal pleura, pericardium, or adjacent lung. Histopathologic examination of the resection specimen is required for definitive staging and determines whether postoperative RT or chemotherapy are recommended. (See <a href=\"#H3068831445\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative RT'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2216922493\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy regimens'</a> below.)</p><p>Because of the risks associated with surgery, patients should be evaluated for evidence of myasthenia gravis; if signs or symptoms are present, these should be treated medically prior to surgery and care should be paid by the anesthesiology team during and after the operation in order to avoid respiratory failure due to myasthenia gravis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thymectomy for myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Perioperative considerations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical management should include a complete resection of the thymus. The current standard of care can include various surgical approaches, including traditional median sternotomy, or <span class=\"nowrap\">thoracoscopic/robotic</span> approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29</a>]. The ability to completely resect a thymoma or thymic carcinoma is determined by the extent of tumor, including the degree of invasion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adhesion of the tumor to contiguous structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Resection of the pericardium as well as accompanying lung parenchyma is sometimes required to achieve a complete resection with histologically negative margins. The likelihood of long-term survival depends upon the completeness of surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>An inflammatory fibrous reaction can mimic tumor invasion, and tumor may be adherent to adjacent structures without being invasive. In such cases, the surgeon should identify the site of adhesion on the resection specimen, so the pathologist can take careful sections from that area.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1626427\"><span class=\"h3\">Potentially resectable disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in whom a complete resection is not considered feasible as the initial treatment (eg, those with tumor invasion into the innominate vein, phrenic nerve(s), or <span class=\"nowrap\">heart/great</span> vessels), multimodality therapy incorporating preoperative chemotherapy and postoperative RT is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29</a>]. Such disease is considered potentially resectable if neoadjuvant therapy allows for a partial or complete response. (See <a href=\"#H2216922493\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy regimens'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3068831445\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative RT'</a> below.)</p><p>Our approach to potentially resectable disease is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combination chemotherapy followed by radical resection with or without postoperative adjuvant RT or chemotherapy offers a chance for prolonged disease-free survival in patients not initially resectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Biopsy to establish the diagnosis of thymic neoplasm is required prior to treatment. The optimal timing, duration, and agents for neoadjuvant chemotherapy have not been defined. The choice of regimens is generally the same as those for unresectable disease.

If disease is resectable, patients should have surgery. Aggressive surgical approaches in cases of locoregional tumor extension have ranged from pleurectomy to extrapleural pneumonectomy. Whether such an aggressive approach is going to lead to prolonged disease-free survival in thymic carcinomas is controversial. Surgery should be followed by postoperative RT.

Preoperative pulmonary function studies should be obtained in all patients so that the extent of respiratory compromise following division of the phrenic nerve can be estimated. Preoperative phrenic nerve function can also be assessed with a fluoroscopic or ultrasonographic sniff test. </p><p>If one phrenic nerve is involved, we typically resect the tumor, sacrificing the phrenic nerve. Ipsilateral diaphragm plication is an option at the time of phrenic nerve sacrifice, although waiting to see which patients become symptomatic and offering it to those patients at a later date is also appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis#H103245224\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diaphragmatic paralysis&quot;, section on 'Transient ventilatory support'</a>.)</p><p>When both nerves are involved, management involves multidisciplinary discussion between the surgeon and radiation oncologist. Resection of one involved phrenic nerve, followed by dissection of the tumor away from the other involved nerve, if possible, is suggested to reduce postoperative respiratory disability. Alternatively, both nerves may be retained, with dissection of the tumor away from each nerve. For either approach, postoperative RT to the area of residual disease is performed, though the field of treatment is larger if both nerves are retained. Importantly, bilateral phrenic nerve resection should <strong>never</strong> be performed because it will result in respiratory compromise and mortality. If the patient has myasthenia gravis, resection of even one phrenic nerve may lead to significant respiratory problems.

It should be recognized, however, that data are limited in regards to which particular stages derive benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. In the presence of a positive margin or residual disease, PORT may be supplemented with systemic chemotherapy, although the evidence in favor is weak.

For patients at increased risk of recurrence because of the extent of disease, retrospective series demonstrate that RT is associated with decreased risk of recurrence and improved survival in select patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/44,46,48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46,48-52</a>]. </p><p>One of the largest retrospective series to address the role of PORT for both thymoma and thymic carcinoma was conducted by the Japanese Association for Research on the Thymus (JART) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The series analyzed 1265 patients with Masaoka stage II or III thymoma or thymic carcinoma and demonstrated that while PORT was associated with improved relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients with thymic carcinoma, it was not associated with an overall survival (OS) benefit in these patients. For patients with thymoma, there was no benefit in either RFS or OS.</p><p>By contrast, a survival benefit associated with PORT for thymoma has been observed in other retrospective analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/44,48,51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,48,51-53</a>]. For example, in a study of 1263 patients with Masaoka stage II or III thymoma registered in a database by the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group, 55 percent of whom were treated with PORT, receipt of PORT was associated with improved OS at five years (95 versus 90 percent) and at 10 years (86 versus 79 percent), a benefit that was observed in both Masaoka stage II and III disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. A separate study of over 4000 patients in the National Cancer Center Database with any-stage thymoma, half of whom received PORT, suggested improved OS with PORT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.72, 95% CI 0.59-0.87 on multivariate analysis), particularly for those with Masaoka stage IIB or III thymoma or with positive margins. The benefit of PORT for Masaoka stage I to IIA disease did not reach statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Among those with thymic carcinoma, PORT was associated with improved OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64-0.97). However, the differences in OS associated with PORT were not statistically significant for any of the stage subgroups.</p><p>In a study of 529 patients with thymoma in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, when compared with those who did not receive PORT, the 345 patients (65 percent) who received PORT had a superior OS rate (76 versus 66 percent) and disease-free survival rate (91 versus 81 percent) at seven years.

Generally, 45 to 50 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy daily fractions over five weeks are administered to the tumor bed and adjacent mediastinum. RT doses up to 60 Gy in 2-Gy daily fractions may be indicated if microscopic or gross residual disease is present following a partial resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toxicities</strong> &ndash; Potential radiation-related toxicities include esophagitis, pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis, pericarditis, and very rarely, radiation myelitis. Late radiation sequelae include radiation lung fibrosis in the lung included in the high-dose area, and a small risk of constrictive pericarditis if a very large volume of heart was included in the RT field. Acceleration of coronary artery disease with an increase in cardiac events such as myocardial infarcts and an increased risk of second cancers in the RT field are potential late complications that are a special concern in young patients who have many decades of expected survival after treatment of their thymic tumors.

The NCCN notes that proton beam therapy should be considered for certain patients, given that it has been shown to improve the dosimetry compared with intensity-modulated RT, allowing less toxicity to normal organs and favorable results in regards to local control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2105840897\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic therapy may have a role as a component of neoadjuvant therapy for patients with potentially resectable disease, those with unresectable disease, and those with more widespread or recurrent disease.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of mediastinal tumors&quot;, section on 'Thymoma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of mediastinal tumors&quot;, section on 'Thymic carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>The relationship between stage of disease and tumor histology, and their combined impact on prognosis, is illustrated by a German series of 228 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. With a median follow-up of five years following treatment, patient outcomes in this series were strongly influenced by the extent of the initial resection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall prognosis was excellent for patients with Masaoka stage I and stage II disease. Three relapses were observed among the 110 patients (3 percent) undergoing total surgical resection. Although the prognosis for patients with Masaoka stage II disease was excellent, tumor-related deaths were observed in some patients more than 10 years after surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among those with Masaoka stage III disease, the prognosis was worse following complete resection, with 27 percent developing recurrent disease. In patients in whom only an incomplete surgical resection was feasible, 62 percent developed tumor relapses. For patients with stage III disease, survival appeared to plateau after five years, with a 10-year survival rate of 83 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, those with Masaoka stage IV disease had continuing mortality, with a 10-year survival rate of 47 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no tumor-related deaths in patients with type A, AB, or B1 disease, which were mostly Masaoka stage I and II disease. In patients with B2, B3, or thymic carcinoma, of which approximately 50 to 60 percent were Masaoka stage III to IV, tumor caused death in 9, 19, and 17 percent of cases, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1628674\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVEILLANCE AFTER TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no clinical trials providing evidence of benefit, monitoring for recurrences with thoracic imaging on an annual basis is warranted given that early intervention may be more effective or at least more feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2605067323\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p>Although there are no trials demonstrating the benefits of computed tomography (CT) scan, we agree with the guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), which recommend CT every six months for two years, then annually for five years for thymic carcinoma, and annually for 10 years for thymoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Recurrence of thymoma may not become apparent for many years after initial treatment. As an example, in a series of 126 patients who underwent complete resection of a thymoma, 24 eventually recurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The time to recurrence ranged from 4 to 175 months (mean, 68 months). The initial sites of recurrence were pleural, local, or distant in 22, 6, and 5 cases, respectively. </p><p>Patients with thymoma are also at risk for the development of second malignancies, which have been reported in 17 to 28 percent of patients following thymectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/2,67-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,67-70</a>]. In a series of 849 cases of thymoma identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, the risk was significantly increased for B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, gastrointestinal cancers, and soft tissue sarcomas (standardized incidence ratios [SIR] 4.7, 1.8, and 11.1, respectively, compared with the number of cases expected in the general population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thymomas and thymic carcinomas are rare tumors that arise in the anterior mediastinum. Thymomas may be an incidental diagnosis discovered at chest imaging, and patients may present with symptoms due to the presence of a mass in the thorax or to a paraneoplastic phenomenon such as myasthenia gravis. (See <a href=\"#H1063727003\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis for patients with thymoma or thymic carcinoma depends upon the stage of disease, complete resectability, and histologic type. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete surgical resection is the initial treatment approach for all patients when preoperative evaluation suggests that a complete resection will be feasible and there are no medical contraindications to surgery. The surgical resection provides additional staging information that can guide further therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110999\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110999 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1626420\" class=\"local\">'Resectable disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a stage I <strong>thymoma</strong> (Masaoka stage I to II) (see <a href=\"#H3068831445\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative RT'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients lacking capsular invasion, we do not recommend postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) given a low risk of recurrence (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Such patients should be followed with annual imaging of the chest (computed tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">[CT]/magnetic</span> resonance imaging [MRI]) to rule out recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with invasion into the mediastinal fat or pleura, we suggest PORT if high-risk features are present (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Examples of high-risk features include microscopic or grossly positive surgical margins or larger tumor size. The addition of PORT in such patients may reduce the risk of recurrence to that of patients with R0 resections and lower-risk features. However, observation is an appropriate alternative given limited data. (See <a href=\"#H1628674\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance after treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with stage II to III <strong>thymoma</strong> (Masaoka stage III) who have undergone resection, either complete or incomplete, we suggest PORT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, contemporary studies have not demonstrated a consistent advantage in this approach, and observation is an appropriate alternative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with stage I to III <strong>thymic carcinoma</strong> (Masaoka stage I to III), we suggest PORT regardless of stage or other risk factors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), given the risk of local recurrence and evidence of improved survival associated with PORT. In the presence of a positive margin, PORT may be supplemented with systemic chemotherapy, although the evidence in favor is weak. If macroscopic residual thymic carcinoma is present, chemoradiotherapy should be utilized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with stage IV <strong>thymoma</strong> or <strong>thymic carcinoma</strong>, the use of PORT should be restricted to palliation of local symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with potentially resectable disease (tumor invasion into great vessels or <span class=\"nowrap\">one/both</span> phrenic nerves), we recommend initial treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If the response to chemotherapy is sufficient to permit surgery and the patient's overall condition permits, we suggest surgical resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). (See <a href=\"#H1626427\" class=\"local\">'Potentially resectable disease'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RT alone, chemotherapy, or the combination is appropriate for patients in whom surgery is not technically feasible or is contraindicated, and may be of curative potential. (See <a href=\"#H1063727857\" class=\"local\">'Unresectable disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who achieve a complete response with either surgery or a combined-modality approach, prolonged follow-up is indicated since late relapses are possible. We agree with the guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), which recommend CT every six months for two years, then annually for five years for thymic carcinoma, and annually for 10 years for thymoma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For recurrent disease:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the absence of widely disseminated disease, we treat isolated recurrences with curative intent (eg, surgical resection with or without postoperative adjuvant therapy) rather than with systemic therapy alone. (See <a href=\"#H2605067323\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with inoperable recurrent disease or disseminated metastases, we offer systemic chemotherapy with a cisplatin-based regimen. Patients should be encouraged to enroll on formal clinical trials whenever possible.
