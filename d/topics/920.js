Thus, the management of the patient with severe TBI is often complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach.</p><p>Anesthesiologists are involved in the care of patients with TBI in various situations, including but not limited to: resuscitation and stabilization in the emergency department (ED), sedation and anesthesia for diagnostic imaging, craniotomy or decompressive craniectomy, extracranial surgery, and intensive care management.</p><p>Surgery and anesthesia may subject the injured brain to new, secondary injuries as a result of hypotension, hypoxemia, hypo- or hypercarbia, fever, hypo- or hyperglycemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased intracranial pressure (ICP) that may adversely impact outcome. </p><p>This topic will discuss the intraoperative anesthetic management of patients with acute TBI. Epidemiology and pathophysiology, prehospital management, general concerns for anesthesia for craniotomy, and anesthesia for acute spinal cord injury are discussed separately.

Patients with TBI may require surgery for other associated injuries (eg, orthopedic, abdominal, or thoracic procedures). Even if such procedures are delayed beyond the immediate postinjury period, the goals for anesthesia should include prevention of secondary brain injury.</p><p>Preanesthetic evaluation should be as comprehensive as possible, but may be limited by the acuity of the clinical situation. In most cases, patients will present to the operating room after evaluation and initial management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4055176509\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When time permits, the usual preanesthesia evaluation should be completed, including the details of comorbidities and medications. The patient's neurologic condition may interfere with his or her ability to provide a history.</p><p>Rapid neurologic assessment is performed using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) to stratify the severity of TBI, where mild, moderate, and severe TBI are those with GCS scores of 13 to 15, 9 to 12, and &lt;9, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854 \">table 1</a>). The severity of TBI estimates the degree of impaired physiology, determines the urgency of a surgical procedure and the plan for postoperative care, and predicts risk for complications and overall prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic brain injury: Epidemiology, classification, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Clinical severity scores'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Trauma surgery may be associated with hypotension and a reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure that may lead to secondary brain injury. For nonemergent extracranial surgery, the patient with TBI should be resuscitated and hemodynamically stabilized prior to operative intervention to minimize the chance of intraoperative hypotension. However, recovery of cerebral autoregulation can be delayed for weeks after TBI, particularly in patients with a lower GCS score, diffuse brain injury, and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-with-acute-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with delayed recovery of cerebral autoregulation tend to have worse outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H1927767003\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403957030\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative laboratory tests should be reviewed, including hemoglobin, platelet count, clotting parameters, electrolytes, glucose, and blood gases. A sample should be sent for type and screen (or type and crossmatch if significant blood loss is expected).</p><p>Abnormalities of coagulation parameters are common in patients with TBI, and require ongoing assessment and correction. (See <a href=\"#H2379357728\" class=\"local\">'Hemostatic management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H705375230\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging modality in the acute phase of TBI, and will detect skull fractures, intracranial hemorrhage, and cerebral edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used as well. Implications of neuroimaging findings for anesthesia include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute intracranial hemorrhage (ie, subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma) may require emergent evacuation and may be associated with intracranial hypertension. Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage may be associated with cerebral vasospasm.

This is often due to cerebral edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute severe traumatic brain injury&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skull fracture may be evident on imaging. Care should be taken when handling the head in those with fracture of the outer surface of the cranial vault in order to avoid further brain injury. Those with or at risk of basilar skull fracture should not have objects placed into the nasal cavity. Also, patients with skull fracture are at increased risk for pneumocephalus and delayed central nervous system infection.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2505316255\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1247304761\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals for anesthetic management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Goals for anesthetic management for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and treat increased intracranial pressure (ICP).

Additional intraoperative monitoring for patients with TBI includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arterial catheterization</strong> &ndash; An arterial catheter should be placed for continuous BP monitoring and to facilitate blood sampling. The transducer should be zeroed at the level of the external auditory meatus to ensure that cerebral perfusion is estimated accurately, especially when the head is elevated above the heart. Importantly, the placement of an arterial catheter should not delay the surgical evacuation of a rapidly expanding intracranial hematoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ICP monitoring </strong>&ndash; ICP monitors are often placed for patients with TBI. Indications for monitoring and the various types of monitors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute severe traumatic brain injury&quot;, section on 'Initial treatment and ICP monitoring'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;, section on 'Types of monitors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">ICP monitoring should be continued during patient transport to allow for immediate treatment of increased ICP. If a ventriculostomy is being used for ICP measurements, the ventriculostomy catheter should be clamped (ie, closed to the drip chamber of the drainage system but open to continuous transduction) during patient transport to avoid catheter malfunction or malplacement and risk of excessive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. If ICP increases during transport, iatrogenic causes should be ruled out (eg, transducer positioned too low) and physiologic causes should be corrected (eg, hypotension, hypercapnia, inadequate sedation). If intracranial hypertension persists, CSF drainage can be considered. The stopcock can be adjusted to allow for ICP measurement with or without CSF drainage, though the &quot;true&quot; ICP and waveform are best evaluated with the ventriculostomy at least transiently closed off to drainage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast with arterial or central venous monitoring transducers, ICP monitors should <strong>never</strong> be connected to a pressure bag; dangerous increase in ICP can occur. Management of ICP monitors should be discussed with the surgeon before and during neurosurgery, and with intensive care staff prior to other types of procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advanced neuromonitoring</strong> &ndash; Novel techniques for advanced, or multimodal, neuromonitoring have been developed but are not in widespread use. These monitors are typically placed in the intensive care unit. Jugular venous oximetry and brain tissue oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) tension monitoring are more readily used intraoperatively than other techniques, such as transcranial Doppler sonography, cerebral microdialysis, and thermal diffusion flowmetry. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute severe traumatic brain injury&quot;, section on 'Advanced neuromonitoring'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Jugular venous oximetry allows for assessment of cerebral O<sub>2</sub> supply and demand without interfering with the surgical field. Monitoring can be accomplished via co-oximetry or with a fiberoptic cable. Normal jugular venous O<sub>2</sub> saturation (SjvO<sub>2</sub>) is 55 to 75 percent. Low SjvO<sub>2</sub> can result from systemic hypotension, systemic hypoxemia, increased ICP, or anemia. SjvO<sub>2</sub> can also be used to effectively titrate hyperventilation as a means to decrease ICP, as high ICP and excessive hyperventilation can both lead to low SjvO<sub>2</sub>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Brain tissue O<sub>2</sub> tension monitoring allows for determination of the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> in brain tissue (PtiO<sub>2</sub>). Normal PtiO<sub>2</sub> is 20 to 35 mmHg, and values below 10 to 15 mmHg are associated with poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-with-acute-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Factors that lead to a decrease in SjvO<sub>2</sub> can potentially cause a decrease in PtiO<sub>2</sub>. One major limitation of this technique is related to the location of the tip of the monitoring probe. The probe is usually placed in white matter by a neurosurgeon. If the probe is located in healthy brain distant from the injury, impaired perfusion and oxygenation of an injured or at-risk brain may not be detected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When such monitors are in place, perioperative management should be discussed with the neurointensive care staff.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1343740150\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous (IV) access should be tailored to the planned procedure, expected intraoperative blood loss, and estimated preoperative blood loss. Even with isolated head trauma, scalp wounds, scalp dissection, and intracranial hemorrhage can result in large-volume blood loss.</p><p>Central venous catheters (CVCs) are often placed for patients with TBI for secure venous access and vasopressor administration. However, placement of a CVC should not delay evacuation of a rapidly expanding intracranial hematoma, and it is very uncommon to place these lines prior to cerebral decompression. A CVC may be placed after cerebral decompression for subsequent ICU care, or for patients with TBI who undergo extracranial surgery. The choice of the site for placement of a CVC varies by institution; some centers avoid the internal jugular site for central venous access in patients with acute TBI because of potential for increasing jugular venous pressure and thereby increasing ICP. Trendelenburg positioning should be avoided or minimized during placement of a CVC in the neck or torso for these patients because the head-down position increases ICP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H128065263\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of anesthetic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The drugs and doses of the medications used to induce and maintain general anesthesia should be chosen to maintain hemodynamic stability, preserve cerebral perfusion, avoid increases in ICP, and avoid secondary brain injury. The choice of induction agents and the effects of anesthetic agents on cerebral physiology are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-craniotomy#H78577820\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for craniotomy&quot;, section on 'Anesthesia induction agents'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-craniotomy#H8564131\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for craniotomy&quot;, section on 'Maintenance of anesthesia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction#H295889145\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;, section on 'Intravenous anesthetic induction'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, patients with TBI may have associated injuries that affect the choice and doses of anesthetic induction agents, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injuries other than the brain injury (eg, abdominal or orthopedic trauma) may cause significant concealed blood loss, which can result in hypovolemia, anemia, and hypotension with induction of anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with TBI may have associated pneumocephalus or pneumothorax. If so, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> (N<sub>2</sub>O) should be used with caution, if at all, since N<sub>2</sub>O diffuses into and expands closed gas spaces.</p><p/><p>There are many ways to safely manage anesthesia for patients with TBI.

The reported incidence of cervical spine injury in patients with severe head injury is between 4 and 8 percent; many of these injuries are mechanically unstable and are associated with spinal cord injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-with-acute-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The decision to perform RSII should be based on the predicted difficulty with airway management and other patient factors.

To date, no neuroprotective agents or strategies (including induced hypothermia) have been shown to produce improved outcome.

SDH is most commonly the result of venous bleeding, though arterial rupture accounts for up to 30 percent of cases. Head trauma is the most common cause of SDH; presentation may occur acutely or insidiously with subacute or chronic SDH. SDH can occur following even minor head trauma in older patients taking anticoagulants who have significant cerebral atrophy that leads to stretching of bridging veins.

(See <a href=\"#H1247304761\" class=\"local\">'Goals for anesthetic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with TBI may have associated injuries that complicate anesthetic management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cervical spine injury should be assumed for patients with TBI unless explicitly ruled out; movement of the cervical spine must be minimized during airway management. (See <a href=\"#H1338571541\" class=\"local\">'Airway management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with TBI are assumed to have a full stomach and at risk for aspiration of stomach contents with induction of anesthesia. The decision to perform a rapid sequence induction should be based on predicted airway difficulty and patient factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abdominal and orthopedic injury may conceal blood loss and result in hypovolemia and anemia, which can increase the risk of hypotension with induction of anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with TBI, we usually perform a rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII). In patients without evidence of intracranial hypertension, we maintain anesthesia with a low-dose inhalation agent and opioids, while for patients with potential for increased ICP, total intravenous (IV) anesthesia (TIVA) may be an alternative. (See <a href=\"#H128065263\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal for intraoperative hemodynamic management for patients with TBI is the maintenance of adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF) to avoid secondary injury. We aim for a cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) of 60 mmHg, to 70 mmHg, avoiding aggressive attempts to achieve a CPP above 70 mmHg. We aim for a systolic blood pressure (SBP) &ge;100 mmHg for patients 50 to 69 years old, and &ge;110 mmHg for patients 15 to 49 or &gt;70 years old. (See <a href=\"#H1927767003\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm, non-glucose-containing isotonic crystalloid solution should be administered IV to maintain euvolemia for patients with TBI. We <strong>do not</strong> routinely follow a liberal transfusion strategy (ie, goal hemoglobin &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> for patients with TBI. Rather, transfusion should be based on ongoing bleeding, clinical status, and patient comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H3846186007\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative fluid management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H739910419\" class=\"local\">'Blood transfusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We manage oxygenation and ventilation for these patients as follows (see <a href=\"#H4273568339\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative ventilation and oxygenation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We aim to avoid hypoxia and hyperoxia with a goal partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) between 60 and 200 mmHg.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypercarbia should always be avoided for patients with TBI.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hyperventilation to a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO<sub>2</sub>) of 30 to 35 mmHg should be used only when indicated and as briefly as possible. Hyperventilation and the resulting reduction in CBF may be required to reduce ICP but may result in brain ischemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We aim for a blood glucose between 80 and 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in order to avoid secondary brain injury. (See <a href=\"#H2895461174\" class=\"local\">'Temperature management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3312888635\" class=\"local\">'Glucose management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-third of patients with severe TBI develop a coagulopathy, which is associated with poor neurologic outcomes and death. Coagulation parameters should be measured during anesthesia, and abnormalities should be corrected promptly. (See <a href=\"#H2379357728\" class=\"local\">'Hemostatic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The plan for emergence from anesthesia and extubation depends on the severity of the brain trauma and other associated injuries.

Epidural hematoma and acute symptomatic subdural hematomas (SDHs) are neurosurgical emergencies that require decompression to avoid brain herniation and death.
