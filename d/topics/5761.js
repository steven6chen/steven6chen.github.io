In particular, the differential diagnosis is much broader and often requires a more extensive evaluation that includes consideration of both common and rare disorders. Nevertheless, the most common causes of early-onset dementia are the same in younger and older adults: Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia.</p><p>The epidemiology, etiology, evaluation, and diagnosis of early-onset dementia will be reviewed here. A more general approach to adults with cognitive impairment or dementia and disease-specific diagnosis and management are presented elsewhere.

According the DSM-5, dementia is defined as significant acquired cognitive impairment in one or more cognitive domains (eg, learning and memory, language, executive function, complex attention, perceptual-motor function, social cognition) that represents a significant decline from previous baseline and interferes with independence in daily activities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91276 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;, section on 'Definition of dementia'</a>.)</p><p>While this definition recognizes multiple different cognitive domains, a decline in memory is one of the earliest and most prominent features of Alzheimer disease dementia and most other forms of dementia. A prominent exception is frontotemporal dementia, in which memory may be relatively preserved in relation to other cognitive domains such as language function or social cognition, at least initially. For most forms of dementia, however, memory and language dysfunction are generally always present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1655989429\"><span class=\"h2\">Early-onset dementia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although terminology varies, we consider early-onset dementia (EOD) to refer to cases of dementia occurring in adults ranging from 18 to 65 years of age. Some authors further subdivide EOD, using young-onset dementia to refer to cases with an age of onset between 18 and 45 years. This distinction is somewhat arbitrary, however, and most of the causative diseases do not follow such strict age cut-offs. A common approach to differential diagnosis, including consideration of rare diseases, should be followed regardless of the age of the younger adult with new cognitive change.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201302183\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of early-onset dementia (EOD) is estimated at 40 to 100 per 100,000 individuals in developed countries, although no broad-based studies have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Published studies have used different methodology, inclusion criteria, and age groups. Patients with traumatic brain injury, Down syndrome, and certain types of vascular disease are major patient groups that may or may not be included in these studies.</p><p>Several population-based studies illustrate the frequency and range of diagnoses most often responsible for EOD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An epidemiologic study in four London boroughs identified 185 patients with an onset of dementia between 30 to 64 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Approximately 55 percent were felt to have a single progressive neurodegenerative etiology, predominantly Alzheimer disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies, dementia related to Parkinson disease, and corticobasal degeneration (including corticobasal syndrome and many other phenotypes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The remaining 45 percent of patients had the following etiologies: vascular-related cognitive change, alcohol-related cognitive change, Huntington disease, cognitive impairment resulting from multiple sclerosis, prion diseases, dementia related to Down syndrome (predominantly AD), and <span class=\"nowrap\">unknown/unclassified</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The four most common etiologies in the cohort were AD (34 percent), vascular dementia (18 percent), FTD (12 percent), and alcohol-related dementia (10 percent). Notably, the prevalence of dementia doubled every 5 years after age 35.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurodegenerative disease accounted for approximately one-third of cases in a retrospective review of all 17 to 45 year old patients given a diagnosis of dementia at a tertiary referral center over an 11-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This was followed by <span class=\"nowrap\">autoimmune/inflammatory</span> disease (21 percent), unknown causes (18 percent), and metabolic disease, including mitochondrial and storage diseases (11 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among the neurodegenerative diseases, FTD accounted for the largest proportion (42 percent) and represented 13 percent of the entire cohort. AD accounted for only 5 percent of those with neurodegenerative disease and 2 percent of the total cohort. This analysis specifically excluded patients with static encephalopathy from traumatic brain injury, acute cerebrovascular events, and patients with Down syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other studies in Japan, Sweden and elsewhere have also found that AD, FTD, and vascular dementia are the most common dementia etiologies in this age range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p/><p>Risk factors for EOD may vary according to the underlying etiology of the dementia. Although genetic etiologies are more common in EOD compared with late-onset dementia, the majority of cases of both EOD and late-onset dementia (excluding autosomal dominant AD, FTD, and Huntington Disease) do not have an identifiable monogenetic cause.</p><p>There is a higher rate of vascular disease in patients with EOD of any type. Many of the risk factors for EOD identified in population-based studies relate to increased vascular risk, including stroke, transient ischemic attack, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic alcohol use, and drug intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201302189\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF EARLY-ONSET DEMENTIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201302195\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurodegenerative dementias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurodegenerative etiologies are the most common cause of cognitive decline and dementia in adults age 35 and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Of the neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer disease (AD) is most common, particularly nearing the age of 65 years. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and vascular dementia are equal to or more prevalent than AD at the younger end of the spectrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alzheimer disease</strong> &ndash; AD in younger adults is most often sporadic, but in those with a family history of early-onset dementia (EOD), dominantly inherited genetic mutations are common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F98780\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98780 \">table 2</a>). These include the following: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) &ndash; Causative mutations in PSEN1 are the most common genetically confirmed cause of early-onset familial AD, accounting for over 50 percent of such cases. Mutations are fully penetrant, with a median age of onset of 43 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Inheritance of this gene may be associated with a higher prevalence of other neurologic signs that precede the development of cognitive deficits, particularly in patients with disease onset early than age 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Notable initial features in some but not all families include myoclonus, seizures, spasticity, and cerebellar ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Mutations are estimated to be 95 percent penetrant, and the median age of onset is later and more variable than with other mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97086\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97086 \">figure 1</a>). PSEN2 has greater than 60 percent homology with PSEN1.

Causative mutations in APP are fully penetrant. AD in people with Down syndrome, which frequently emerges in the fifth decade, is due to replication of the APP gene on chromosome 21 and thus a 1.5 gene dosage.

Particularly when inheritance is homozygous, APOE &epsilon;4 both increases the risk of AD and lowers the age of onset for disease compared with those without the &epsilon;4 allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Causative mutations have been identified in up to 40 percent of all cases. Identified genetic mutations include C9ORF72 (the most common cause of familial FTD), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), and progranulin (GRN).

Most of these diseases begin with cognitive and behavioral changes, typically before the age of 65 years, accompanied by additional motor system signs and symptoms.

The mean age at onset of DLB is 75 years, although early-onset cases are increasingly recognized. Most cases of DLB are sporadic. In addition to cognitive dysfunction, core clinical features of DLB include cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and Parkinsonism. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder is another common, often early, sign of DLB. Recognized genetic associations in one or more studies include alpha-synuclein gene duplication or triplication, glucocerebrosidase gene mutations, gamma-synuclein gene mutations, and potentially presenilin mutations.

Common contributing factors in younger patients include multiple cerebral infarctions, multiple subcortical infarctions (frequently lacunar infarctions), hemorrhagic infarctions, and chronic widespread small vessel ischemic disease. Compared with older adults, younger adults with vascular dementia are more likely to have lacunar infarctions and prominent frontal-executive dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The major clinical manifestations of CADASIL are transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke, cognitive deficits with early executive dysfunction, migraine with aura, and neuropsychiatric disturbances. A family history of multiple strokes and dementia is often present. Increasing subcortical infarct burden tends to lead to EOD beginning around age 50 to 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A similar phenotype has also been described in association with mutations in cathepsin-A (CTSA), termed cathepsin A-related arteriopathy with strokes and leukoencephalopathy (CARASAL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The majority of patients have dysarthria, ataxia, dystonia, or tremor; nearly all patients with neurologic manifestations have Kayser-Fleischer rings.

For most depressed patients (especially younger and middle aged adults), cognitive dysfunction is readily distinguished from that caused by dementia. Neurocognitive dysfunction in depression is generally mild, and marked by a greater number of subjective complaints rather than objective findings. In older adult patients, memory problems may be mistaken for dementia (&ldquo;pseudodementia&rdquo;); these problems often abate with successful treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The early stages of certain neurodegenerative diseases, in particular the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), can be dominated by personality and behavioral changes suggestive of primary psychiatric disease (eg, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder). In some cases, treatment trials, formal psychiatric evaluation, neuroimaging, and clinical follow up are required to distinguish these disorders from each other. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delirium is associated with fluctuating, altered level of consciousness and cognitive change.

Most cases are provoked by a medical stressor such as infection, surgery, or medication. Infections should be adequately treated. Medications known to induce delirium should be stopped if possible. Outpatient follow up may be necessary once the index illness has been adequately treated to determine whether cognitive function has returned to normal; interview of caregivers and other informants about premorbid function is also critical.

Risk factors for OSA (eg, obesity, male gender, large neck circumference, and oropharyngeal crowding) should prompt consideration of a sleep study. Other comorbidities that are often associated with OSA include refractory hypertension, chronic lung disease, and stroke. In the longitudinal study discussed above that included 226 adults &lt;65 years of age referred to a tertiary care center for suspected dementia, OSA was the most common non-neurologic or psychiatric alternative diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Family members or someone who knows the patient well must be available to give an adequate history of cognitive and behavioral changes. The DSM-5 criteria for the diagnosis of dementia (major neurocognitive disorder) are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91276 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The history should establish the type of cognitive impairment, the most prominent domains affected (eg, learning and memory, language, visuospatial function, executive function, social cognition), any accompanying behavioral or personality changes, the time course of symptoms, and the degree of functional impairment. </p><p>Other important historical features include headaches (as often occur in vascular causes of dementia, including cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy [CADASIL]), stroke-like symptoms (as occur in multiple sclerosis [MS], mitochondrial disease, and vascular disease), underlying neoplasm (suggesting possible paraneoplastic disease), multiple organ system dysfunction (mitochondrial and metabolic disorders), and a history of significant head injury (chronic traumatic encephalopathy).</p><p>A particular focus on family history is important. Many of the causes of EOD are familial. A history of cognitive decline at an early age in a parent (or perhaps a debilitating psychiatric illness) could indicate the presence of a familial form of AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Hungtington disease, other heritable neurodegenerative dementias, or neurometabolic disease, including adult-onset leukodystrophies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201302426\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical and neurologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with EOD should undergo a complete physical and neurologic examination.

Patients with MS may have an afferent pupillary defect and optic disc pallor from prior optic neuritis.</p><p>Cardiac examination may reveal signs of heart failure or arrhythmia which may be seen in mitochondrial disease and Wilson disease. Abdominal examinations showing hepatomegaly and other sequelae of liver dysfunction can be seen in Wilson disease and mitochondrial disease.</p><p>Facial nerve palsy and other cranial neuropathies can be seen in patients with neurosarcoidosis and some infectious causes of encephalopathy. Whipple disease can cause oculomasticatory myorhythmia, ie, characteristic rhythmic rapid muscle contractions around the mouth in coordination with pendular eye movements.</p><p>Careful assessment of motor function can be essential to diagnosis. Subtle signs of parkinsonism may be present in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson disease dementia. Asymmetry in motor function, whether frank weakness or subtle upper motor neuron signs, is often present in CADASIL, MS, vascular dementia, and mitochondrial disease (eg, mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes [MELAS]). Myoclonus can be seen in prion disease and mitochondrial disease (eg, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers [MERRF]).</p><p>Movement disorders are quite common in a variety of diseases that manifest EOD; suggestive features may include resting tremor (DLB and Parkinson disease dementia), a wing-beating tremor (Wilson disease), and chorea (Huntington disease). Sensory examination can reveal a peripheral neuropathy which can be present in sarcoidosis and mitochondrial disease, among others. </p><p>Cerebellar ataxia in a patient with EOD requires special attention. Alcoholic dementia should be a primary consideration. Differential diagnosis beyond this includes neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple systems atrophy cerebellar subtype (olivopontocerebellar degeneration) and prion disease (eg, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome).

This includes careful consideration of neurometabolic diseases, which can be diagnosed by metabolic and genetic testing in the vast majority of cases and do not require brain biopsy for diagnosis. Neuropathologic tissue diagnosis is most warranted when a reversible or treatable condition is suspected, or if a potentially harmful treatment is being considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The risk of complications with brain biopsy is around 8 to 9 percent, with about 5 percent or less having permanent neurological sequelae; the risk of death is about 1 percent or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-onset-dementia-in-adults/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. </p><p>In selected diseases, a less invasive tissue diagnosis may be useful for diagnostic purposes.

A clear family history should be documented in suspected cases, with the caveat that a family history might not always be apparent or available because of censoring by premature death, small family size, uncertain parentage, de novo mutations, and incomplete penetrance. </p><p>The decision to pursue genetic testing is highly individualized and depends on a variety of factors, including the age of the patient, the presence or absence of additional family members who might be at risk, the cost of the test and insurance coverage, and whether there are other affected family members. Among the neurodegenerative dementias, genetic testing is most often pursued for CADASIL, Huntington disease, autosomal-dominant forms of AD, and in patients with FTD, particularly when there is concomitant motor neuron disease. Genetic testing is also available and useful in the diagnosis of an increasing number of adult-onset leukodystrophies and other neurometabolic diseases.

Dementia itself generally refers to progressive cognitive impairment in one or more cognitive domains, most often memory, that represents a significant decline from previous baseline and interferes with functional independence. (See <a href=\"#H1655989224\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for EOD vary widely according to the underlying etiology of the dementia. Although genetic etiologies are more common in EOD compared with late-onset dementia, the majority of cases of both EOD and late-onset dementia do not have an identifiable monogenetic cause. As in older adults, the most common etiologies in most studies are Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). (See <a href=\"#H201302183\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are numerous causes of EOD, most of which fall under the broad categories of neurodegenerative dementia, vascular disease, infectious disease, inflammatory and autoimmune disease, and neurometabolic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F98780\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98780 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H201302189\" class=\"local\">'Causes of early-onset dementia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dementia should be distinguished from symptoms of memory loss or personality and behavioral change that are nonprogressive or provoked by underlying systemic illness, medication, psychiatric disorder, or structural brain pathology. (See <a href=\"#H1655988586\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical assessment of a patient with EOD is similar to that of an older adult but often needs to be extended to detect a broader range of diseases than the common neurodegenerative dementias. The information gained from the initial evaluation, which should include a detailed history, physical and neurologic examination, cognitive assessment, basic laboratories, and structural neuroimaging, will guide further testing. (See <a href=\"#H201302378\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pace of the illness and the presence or absence of additional neurologic and systemic signs and symptoms largely determine which additional tests are indicated. (See <a href=\"#H1655988560\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The majority of patients with a slow, insidious disease course and &ldquo;pure&rdquo; cognitive decline by history and examination will have a neurodegenerative dementia, particularly if routine MRI is unremarkable or shows only mild atrophy. The primary goal of further testing in such patients is to improve diagnostic certainty as to the type of dementia. Additional testing may include CSF for amyloid and tau, functional neuroimaging (eg, amyloid PET, FDG-PET), and focused genetic testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a rapidly progressive course should routinely undergo lumbar puncture, electroencephalography (EEG) if there is clinical suspicion for seizures, and selected laboratory studies. A search for occult neoplasm is indicated if limbic encephalitis is suspected. Prion and other infectious diseases must also be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with cognitive decline and evidence of additional neurologic or multisystem dysfunction, the range of tests to consider is more broad and should be directed by the additional physical and neurologic signs and symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F99871\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99871 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F99885\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99885 \">table 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for EOD is not generalizable given the heterogeneity of causes.
