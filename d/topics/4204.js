It colonizes the human intestinal tract after the normal gut flora has been altered by antibiotic therapy. <em>C. difficile</em> infection (CDI) is one of the most common health care-associated infections and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, especially among older adult hospitalized patients.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of <em>C. difficile</em> infection will be reviewed here. The treatment, epidemiology, and prevention of <em>C. difficile</em> infection are discussed separately.

Most case occur within two weeks of antibiotic therapy. Rarely, symptoms present as late as 10 weeks after cessation of antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy (flexible proctoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy) examination may be normal or demonstrate a spectrum of findings, from patchy, mild erythema and friability to severe pseudomembranous colitis (severe inflammation of the inner lining of the bowel). (See <a href=\"#H4904350\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p>Unexplained leukocytosis in hospitalized patients (even in the absence of diarrhea) may reflect underlying CDI.

One study including more than 1500 patients with CDI noted 34 percent of patients with recurrent infection needed admission, 28 percent developed severe disease, and 4 percent developed fulminant colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for recurrence include age &gt;65 years, severe underlying medical disorders, need for ongoing therapy with concomitant antibiotics during treatment for CDI, and lack of an antibody-mediated immune response to toxin B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>].</p><p>Recurrent symptoms may be due to relapse of the initial infecting strain or reinfection with a new strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Recurrent CDI often represents relapse rather than reinfection, regardless of the interval between episodes. Among 134 paired stool isolates from 102 patients with recurrent <em>C. difficile</em> infections, isolates obtained 2 to 8 weeks apart were identical in 88 percent of cases; isolates obtained 8 weeks to 11 months apart were identical in 65 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Persistent diarrhea without resolution during initial therapy should prompt an evaluation for other causes and should not be considered recurrent disease.

The diagnostic approach for suspected recurrent <em>C. difficile</em> is the same as the approach for initial infection.</p><p>For patients with diarrhea and suspected <em>C. difficile</em> infection, liquid stool should be sent for <em>C. difficile</em> testing. Diagnostic laboratory testing should be pursued only in patients with clinically significant diarrhea. Formed stool from asymptomatic patients should not be submitted for laboratory testing, since presence of <em>C. difficile</em> toxin gene does not distinguish between CDI and asymptomatic carriage (which does not warrant treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>].</p><p>For patients with ileus and suspected <em>C. difficile</em> infection, laboratory diagnosis via rectal swab for toxin assay or anaerobic culture may be performed; the sensitivity of rectal swab for <em>C. difficile</em> culture in the setting of ileus is high (although takes time) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,39,40</a>].</p><p>Findings of pseudomembranous colitis (purulent inflammation of the inner lining of the bowel) on radiographic or endoscopic examination are highly suggestive of <em>C. difficile</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,41-44</a>].</p><p>There are several diagnostic tests available for the laboratory diagnosis of <em>C. difficile</em> infection, each with advantages and limitations. We favor use of nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for laboratory diagnosis of <em>C. difficile</em>, either alone or as part of an algorithm including initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) screening for glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) antigen and toxins A and B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100540\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100540 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,45</a>].</p><p>A positive test result for <em>C. difficile </em>infection may be presumed in the setting of positive EIA for GDH antigen and toxin A or B, a negative result may be presumed if both EIAs are negative, and confirmatory NAAT may be used if the EIA results are discordant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/46-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-50</a>].

There is also no role for laboratory testing in asymptomatic patients or in patients receiving treatment for acute <em>C. difficile</em> infection; stool assays may remain positive during or after clinical recovery.</p><p>Radiographic imaging of the abdomen and pelvis is warranted for patients with clinical manifestations of severe illness or fulminant colitis (severe abdominal pain, abdominal distention with apparent ileus, fever, hypovolemia, lactic acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> marked leukocytosis) to evaluate for presence of toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, or other findings warranting surgical intervention. Findings of pseudomembranous colitis on radiographic examination are highly suggestive of <em>C. difficile</em> infection and should prompt laboratory testing.

It may also be helpful for patients with ileus or fulminant colitis in the absence of diarrhea since it may allow visualization of pseudomembranes (severe inflammation of the inner lining of the bowel), a finding that is highly suggestive of <em>C. difficile</em> infection. However, not all patients with CDI have pseudomembranes, particularly patients with mild or partially treated infection, and absence of pseudomembranes does not rule out <em>C. difficile</em> infection.

NAATs are specific for toxigenic strains but do not test for active toxin protein production and are capable of detecting asymptomatic carriers of <em>C. difficile</em>; therefore, only liquid stool samples from patients with &ge;3 loose stools in 24 hours should be tested. Only a single stool sample should be tested. NAAT results can be available within as little as one hour. NAAT results may be falsely negative if stool specimen collection is delayed and the patient treated empirically for suspected <em>C. difficile</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4901947\" class=\"local\">'Overview of diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Given its high sensitivity and its inability to distinguish <em>C. difficile</em> infection from asymptomatic carriage, overdiagnosis of CDI has emerged as a risk of NAATs, resulting in antibiotic treatment of patients who may not require such therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. In a study of more than 1400 patients with suspected CDI, patients whose stool tested positive by NAAT but negative by immunoassay had a lower toxin load and less diarrhea than patients for whom both assays were positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. For circumstances in which initial testing consisted of NAAT (with positive result), some favor subsequent testing with EIA for toxins A and B to bolster clinical specificity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EIA for <em>C. difficile</em> GDH antigen &ndash; GDH antigen is an essential enzyme produced constitutively by all <em>C. difficile</em> isolates; however, its detection cannot distinguish between toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>]. Therefore, testing for GDH antigen is useful as an initial screening step in a multistep approach, which also consists of subsequent testing with more specific assays such as toxin A and B EIA or NAAT on specimens that are GDH antigen positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. GDH antigen testing has good sensitivity, and results are available in less than one hour.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EIA for <em>C. difficile</em> toxins A and B &ndash; Most <em>C. difficile</em> strains produce both toxins A and B, although some strains produce toxin B only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/75-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-79</a>]. No CDI due to strains producing toxin A alone has been reported. However, testing for both toxins by EIA gives a higher sensitivity than testing for toxin B alone. The sensitivity of EIA for toxins A and B is about 75 percent; the specificity is high (up to 99 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>]. There is a relatively high false-negative rate since 100 to 1000 pg of toxin must be present for the test to be positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Hence, GDH antigen testing is often used together with toxin EIA. If the GDH is positive but the toxin EIA is negative, adjudication with NAAT is beneficial. A number of inexpensive assays are commercially available, and test results are available within hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selective anaerobic culture &ndash; Selective anaerobic culture is seldom employed for clinical diagnosis as results take several days to finalize. Culture on selective medium with toxin testing of isolated <em>C. difficile</em> is a highly sensitive diagnostic method, although culture cannot distinguish toxin-producing strains from non-toxin-producing strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Use of a second test (EIA, NAAT) is required to detect toxin production by cultured <em>C. difficile</em> strains. Culture followed by strain testing for toxin is considered by most to be the gold standard for diagnosis of <em>C. difficile.</em> Treatment of stool with heat or alcohol to shock spores (to increase vegetative growth and remove contaminants) is sometimes used to improve yield. Culture is useful for epidemiologic studies but is generally too slow and labor intensive for routine clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Rectal swab for toxin assay or anaerobic culture can be a useful diagnostic tool for patients with ileus and suspected <em>C. difficile</em> infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cell culture cytotoxicity assay &ndash; The cell culture cytotoxicity assay is sensitive and specific but resource intensive and time consuming. The assay was developed contemporaneously with the discovery of <em>C. difficile</em> and has been used as a gold standard test for diagnosis of <em>C. difficile</em>; it is more sensitive than enzyme immunoassay, although it is limited by lack of standardization, the requirement for a cell culture facility, and slow turnaround time (approximately two days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. The cell culture cytotoxicity assay is performed by adding a prepared stool sample (diluted, buffered, and filtered) to a monolayer of cultured cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41,85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,85,86</a>]. If <em>C. difficile</em> toxin is present, it exerts a cytopathic effect characterized by cell rounding; specificity of the cytotoxicity is demonstrated by neutralization of the cytopathic effect with specific antiserum.</p><p/><p>It is important to note that <em>C. difficile</em> toxin degrades at room temperature and may be undetectable within two hours after collection; therefore, specimens for testing based on toxin detection (EIA for <em>C. difficile</em> toxins and cell culture cytotoxicity assay) should be kept at 4&ordm;C if delay in laboratory testing is anticipated. In addition, a suspected outbreak should prompt freezing of stool samples for later investigation.</p><p>Fecal leukocyte testing is not helpful for diagnosis of <em>C. difficile</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383196541\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjunctive diagnostic tools</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjunctive diagnostic tools for evaluating patients with suspected <em>C. difficile</em> infection include radiographic imaging and endoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7229445\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiographic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographic imaging of the abdomen and pelvis is warranted for patients with clinical manifestations of severe disease (severe abdominal pain, abdominal distention with apparent ileus, fever, hypovolemia, lactic acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> marked leukocytosis) or fulminant colitis (characterized by hypotension or ileus) to evaluate for presence of toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, or other findings warranting surgical intervention.

The decision to proceed with endoscopy should be made carefully; if pursued, limited flexible sigmoidoscopy is preferred with minimal or no air insufflation to avoid perforation of the inflamed colon.</p><p>Findings on lower gastrointestinal endoscopy in the setting of <em>C. difficile</em> infection include bowel wall edema, erythema, friability, and inflammation. The finding of pseudomembranes on the inflamed mucosal surface are highly suggestive of <em>C. difficile</em> infection and should prompt diagnostic laboratory confirmation if not already performed (via stool assay or, in the setting of ileus, a rectal swab for toxin assay or anaerobic culture) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. However, not all patients with CDI have pseudomembranes, particularly patients with mild or partially treated infection, and absence of pseudomembranes does not rule out <em>C. difficile</em> infection. Pseudomembranes are rarely observed in the setting of recurrent <em>C. difficile</em> infection or inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>]. There are rare reports of other pathogens also capable of causing pseudomembranous colitis, and occasionally pseudomembranes are seen in patients with uremia or ischemic colitis.

Some patients with pseudomembranous colitis have scattered lesions with relatively normal-appearing intervening mucosa, while others have a confluent pseudomembrane covering the entire mucosa. Pseudomembranes may be absent in the rectosigmoid area but present more proximally, although colonoscopy for proximal evaluation of the colon is not warranted for diagnosis of <em>C. difficile</em> given potential bowel tissue friability and risk of perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/91,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,95</a>].</p><p>Biopsy is not needed for diagnosis of <em>C. difficile</em>.

Differentiation of noninfectious antibiotic-associated diarrhea from <em>C. difficile</em> infection may be difficult, especially in patients who are asymptomatic <em>C. difficile</em> carriers; this is most relevant among patients in nursing homes or hospitals where the rate of asymptomatic carriage ranges from 10 to 50 percent (in community populations, the rate of asymptomatic carriage is &le;5 percent). Cessation of symptoms with discontinuation of oral intake is a distinguishing feature of osmotic diarrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69745\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69745 \">figure 1</a>).

The association between IBD and <em>C. difficile</em> may be due to a variety of factors, including dysbiosis associated with colitis, antibiotic use for treatment of other gastrointestinal pathogens, and frequent hospitalization for management of IBD flares.

Furthermore, <em>C. difficile</em> may be difficult to distinguish from an IBD relapse given the similar symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and low-grade fever. Thus, a high index of suspicion is required when evaluating IBD patients with apparent flares, especially those who have recently received antibiotics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> been hospitalized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The diagnosis requires laboratory testing; endoscopy is usually not helpful because IBD patients generally do not develop pseudomembranes.

Criteria proposed for severe CDI (based on expert opinion) include white blood cell count &gt;15,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serum creatinine &ge;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H7226985\" class=\"local\">'Severe and fulminant colitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fulminant colitis (previously referred to as severe, complicated CDI) may be characterized by hypotension or shock, ileus, or megacolon. (See <a href=\"#H7226985\" class=\"local\">'Severe and fulminant colitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent <em>C. difficile</em> infection is defined by complete abatement of symptoms while on appropriate therapy, followed by subsequent reappearance of diarrhea and other symptoms after treatment has ended. Relapse may present within days or weeks of completing treatment for <em>C. difficile</em>; the clinical presentation may be similar to or more severe than the initial presentation. (See <a href=\"#H7229028\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of <em>C. difficile</em> infection is established via a positive stool test for <em>C. difficile</em> toxin(s) or <em>C. difficile</em> toxin gene. We favor use of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for laboratory diagnosis of <em>C. difficile</em>, either alone or as part of an algorithm including initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) screening for glutamate dehydrogenase (GHD) antigen and toxins A and B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100540\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100540 \">algorithm 1</a>). The diagnostic approach for suspected recurrent <em>C. difficile</em> is the same as the approach for initial infection. (See <a href=\"#H4901947\" class=\"local\">'Overview of diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing should be pursued only in patients with clinically significant diarrhea, since testing cannot distinguish between CDI and asymptomatic carriage (which does not warrant treatment). For patients with ileus, laboratory diagnosis via perirectal swab for toxin assay or anaerobic culture may be performed. (See <a href=\"#H4901947\" class=\"local\">'Overview of diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic imaging of the abdomen and pelvis is warranted for patients with clinical manifestations of severe illness or fulminant colitis to evaluate for presence of toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, or other findings warranting surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H4901947\" class=\"local\">'Overview of diagnostic approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7229445\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy is not warranted in patients with typical clinical manifestations of <em>C. difficile</em> infection, a positive laboratory test, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical response to empiric treatment. In general, endoscopy may be pursued for circumstances in which an alternative diagnosis is suspected that requires direct visualization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biopsy of the bowel mucosa. It may also be helpful for patients with ileus or fulminant colitis in the absence of diarrhea since it may allow visualization of pseudomembranes (severe inflammation of the inner lining of the bowel), a finding that is highly suggestive of <em>C. difficile</em> infection. (See <a href=\"#H4904350\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">McDonald LC, Gerding DN, Johnson S, et al.
