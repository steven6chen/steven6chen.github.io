This is particularly true in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 40 million people are living with HIV and more than 350 million episodes of malaria occur yearly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is also evidence of a negative interaction between these two infections. HIV increases the risk of malaria infection and the development of clinical malaria. Conversely, malaria increases HIV replication.</p><p>The significant interactions between HIV and malaria infections, including during pregnancy, will be reviewed here. Additional information regarding malaria in the HIV-uninfected host is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-uncomplicated-falciparum-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-severe-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of severe malaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are five malarial species that infect humans. Presently, most data on HIV interaction with malaria are derived from <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>&ndash;endemic regions of sub-Saharan Africa. However, as HIV spreads to areas endemic for <em>Plasmodium vivax</em>, similar important interactions may be identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunity to malaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunity to malaria is characterized by an age-related reduction in parasite burden, clinical symptoms, and prevalence of severe disease in individuals residing in an endemic area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <em>P. falciparum</em> infection and the burden of parasitemia are often less severe in older adults than in children. Children are at increased risk since they have not yet acquired natural immunity; pregnant women, particularly primagravids, transiently lose some of their acquired immunity. The degree of immunity is also related to transmission intensity, which varies geographically. HIV-related immunosuppression diminishes this acquired immunity. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Impact of HIV on malaria'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical versus asymptomatic malaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, individuals living in endemic areas may develop partial immunity to disease following repeated infections. These &quot;immune&quot; individuals are not immune to infection per se. Following a bite by an infected mosquito, they will still develop parasitemia, but the severity of clinical symptoms is typically limited. This can affect estimates of clinical infection since patients who live in endemic areas are much less symptomatic and often have no symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT OF MALARIA ON HIV</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">T cell activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vitro, malarial antigens lead to T cell activation and HIV viral replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Episodes of malaria have been associated with declines in CD4 cell counts over time compared with HIV-infected patients without parasitemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, more studies are needed to confirm this observation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral load</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malaria infection is associated with a temporary rise of HIV viral load, although long term this does not appear to hasten progression to AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. A cohort study performed in Malawi prospectively enrolled 348 aparasitemic patients to obtain a baseline HIV viral load and followed them over time with active surveillance for malaria infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A near doubling of HIV RNA was demonstrated between baseline and follow-up in those patients who acquired malaria infection. Increases in viral load were greatest in patients with fever, CD4 counts &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> and in those with a parasite density <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;2000/microL</span>. This rise was temporary, with HIV viral load returning to baseline at two months after treatment of malaria. If viral loads are being used to monitor response to antiretroviral therapy, testing should be delayed if the patient has had a recent malaria infection.</p><p>This transient increase in viral load would be predicted to have minimal impact on long-term HIV progression, unless infections were frequent or remained occult and untreated. However, from a public health standpoint, even a transient rise in HIV viral load at a population level could impact sexual transmission. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Coinfection and spread of disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV-related survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comparing rates of HIV-related survival in malaria-endemic to nonendemic countries is problematic due to the higher prevalence of additional healthcare problems found in these geographic regions, which may also impact morbidity and mortality. In addition, there are few well-done studies in malaria-endemic areas to address this question. However, studies from Uganda and Malawi find a 10-year survival rate after HIV infection that is comparable with rates seen in studies in developed non&ndash;malaria-endemic countries in the pre&ndash;potent antiretroviral therapy era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT OF HIV ON MALARIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies to define the impact of HIV on malaria have been conducted to examine various malaria disease markers including susceptibility, prevalence of malaria infection, peripheral parasite burden, disease severity, and response to treatment. Patients coinfected with HIV have a lower number of antimalarial antibodies, and this may contribute to the higher prevalence of infection. A study of 18 HIV-infected and 18 HIV-uninfected Rwandan adults found that the mean antimalarial immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody breadth across HIV-infected individuals was lower than the mean breadth across HIV-uninfected individuals (mean 83 antigens versus 208 antigens, respectively); the overall magnitude of IgG reactivity was also lower in HIV-infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV serostatus and immunosuppression may be associated with an increased risk of susceptibility to malaria infection as illustrated by the following studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort study was conducted in 224 HIV-infected and 125 HIV-uninfected adults in Malawi to assess whether HIV serostatus may affect incidence of malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. HIV-1 seropositivity was significantly associated with first and second episode of parasitemia. The risk of a first parasitemia episode was inversely related to baseline CD4 cell count in HIV-1&ndash;infected persons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Uganda, a retrospective study was performed in 1965 patients who received treatment for an episode of malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Use of molecular genotyping demonstrated that HIV-infected patients were at significantly higher risk of acquiring new infections than HIV-uninfected patients during the standard 28-day follow-up period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Zambia, a clinical trial was performed in 971 adults with uncomplicated malaria; HIV infection was detected in 33 percent of study participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with CD4 counts &lt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> were at increased risk for recurrent parasitemia, recrudescence, and new infection.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of clinical malaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Host immunity, as measured by CD4 cell counts, appears to be a critical factor in the clinical presentation of malaria in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. HIV status may also increase the risk of high-level parasitemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a longitudinal surveillance study of 600 HIV-infected patients in Malawi, malaria blood smears were obtained monthly and were also performed if the patient had any illness suggestive of malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The incidence of clinical malaria episodes was higher in participants with CD4 counts &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> than in those with relatively preserved CD4 counts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of 222 HIV-infected and 237 HIV-uninfected patients in Uganda who had routine and sick clinic visits, the risk of clinical malaria was significantly higher in HIV-infected patients than in HIV-uninfected patients (16 versus 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This risk increased with advanced immunosuppression (sixfold higher in patients with a CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> compared with those with a CD4 count &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span>. Parasitemia was more commonly observed in HIV-infected patients than HIV-uninfected patients (12 versus 6 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Severity of malaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are conflicting reports as to whether HIV serostatus contributes to the severity of malaria infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/16,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20-22</a>]. This may be partly related to whether a patient lives in a region of stable or unstable malaria transmission. However, several studies have suggested increased risk of severe disease among HIV-infected patients with significant immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.) The range of findings is illustrated below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort study from South Africa was undertaken to examine the effect of HIV status and prior history of malaria on the clinical expression of malarial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Nonimmune HIV-infected patients with immunosuppression were significantly more likely to have severe malaria (13 of 36 patients) than were nonimmune HIV-uninfected patients (9 of 75 patients; odds ratio 4.15, 95% CI 1.57-10.97).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 660 adults with HIV in Malawi followed over one to two years, only three participants had severe malaria; all three had CD4 counts less than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a hospital database in France, 104 HIV-infected patients and 161 HIV-uninfected patients were identified who had acquired malaria during travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. HIV serostatus was found to be a risk factor for severe malaria only in those patients who had a CD4 cell count of &lt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 655 children and 68 adults with malaria in Mozambique, children with HIV coinfection presented with more severe acidosis, anemia, and respiratory distress, as well as higher peripheral blood parasitemia and plasma <em>P. falciparum</em> histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Independent predictors for death were renal impairment, acidosis, parasitemia, and plasma PfHRP2 concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">COINFECTION AND SPREAD OF DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A direct relationship has been noted between the height of plasma HIV viral load levels and probability of transmission of HIV per coital act [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Since coinfection leads to a near one-log increase in viral load in chronically HIV-infected patients and HIV increases susceptibility to malaria infection, there are concerns that coinfection may be contributing to further spread of both diseases.</p><p>Using a mathematical model, researchers estimated the impact of HIV and malaria on one another in Kenya [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Excess prevalence was estimated as 2.1 percent for HIV and 5.1 percent for malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Since 1980, this disease interaction may have been responsible for 8500 excess HIV infections and 980,000 excess malaria episodes. Coinfection may have also facilitated the geographic expansion of malaria in areas where HIV prevalence is high.</p><p>Not all malaria infections will increase HIV viral load. In a longitudinal study of 27 Rwandan patients with HIV and malaria infection, no change in viral load was noted for one month post malaria treatment, including 10 patients who remained undetectable (viral load &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, the effect of malaria on HIV is region specific.</p><p>The prevalence of mosquito-transmissible bloodborne forms (eg, gametocytes) is also higher in HIV-infected patients with immunosuppression (CD4 counts &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL),</span> which may have additional implications in malaria transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When malaria occurs during pregnancy, the disease is more severe, and hypoglycemia and respiratory complications are more common. Concurrent HIV infection further affects immunity to placental malaria and has severe consequences for perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality, as discussed below. These observations emphasize the need for malaria prophylaxis during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of malaria in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Placental malaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy-associated malaria is characterized by sequestration and multiplication of a distinct population of malarial parasites in the placenta, which express a specific class of variant surface antigens (VSAs). These antigens mediate adhesion of parasite-infected erythrocytes to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the intervillous space leading to placental insufficiency. With each pregnancy, immunity to placental malaria occurs and the prevalence of maternal and fetal complications declines. This is associated with maternal production of antibody specific to CSA expressing parasites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of malaria in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This may explain the clinical observation that better malaria-related birth outcomes are seen after multiple pregnancies. However, this immunologic benefit appears to be lost in HIV-infected pregnant women since multiparous women have similar clinical outcomes to those of primigravidas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A study of pregnant women with malaria from Malawi demonstrated lower concentrations of CSA VSA immunoglobulin G in HIV-infected women compared with those who did not have HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Reduced antibody production correlated with lower CD4 T cell counts, leading the investigators to suggest that impaired humoral immunity may account for an increase in susceptibility to placental malaria in this patient population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal health</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In studies of HIV-uninfected and -infected pregnant women, dual infection with HIV and malaria is associated with an increased risk of higher parasitemias, maternal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], postpartum maternal anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and severe clinical disease compared with HIV-uninfected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Perinatal outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies suggest that dual infection with malaria and HIV leads to an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, including increased infant mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study was performed to examine the relationship between maternal HIV infection, placental malaria infection, and infant mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Of 2608 pregnant women, 138 (5 percent) were HIV infected. In a multivariate analysis, neonatal mortality in infants born to mothers with both placental malaria and HIV infection was significantly greater than infants born to mothers with either infection alone. Coinfection with malaria and HIV was associated with increased risk of stillbirth (odds ratio 4.7, 95% CI 1.34-16.78) and preterm delivery (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 2.17-7.75). Each infection was independently associated with an increased risk of low birthweight, low Apgar scores, and fetal growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 986 pregnant women in Zimbabwe, the prevalence of HIV and malaria infections was 8 and 15 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Malaria and HIV infections were independently associated with an increased risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, low birthweight, very low birthweight, low Apgar scores, and fetal growth restriction. Dual infection with HIV and malaria was associated with an increased risk of maternal, perinatal, and early infant death.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of malaria on HIV viral load</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some regions, malarial infection results in a temporary increase in HIV viral load in nonpregnant and pregnant adults, which returns to baseline after antimalarial treatment. Whether this transient rise in viral load has an impact on maternal health over time is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/5,28,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28,34</a>].</p><p>However, an increase in viral load at the time of delivery may result in an increase in vertical transmission of HIV. The placenta is the organ by which maternal fetal HIV transmission occurs, and disruption by malarial parasites could in theory result in increased mother-to-child transmission of HIV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent preventive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that pregnant women living in sub-Saharan Africa in areas of stable malaria transmission receive intermittent preventative antimalarial therapy (IPT) to reduce placental malaria and its complications.</p><p>The most commonly used regimen for IPT in pregnant women is sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP; 1500 mg sulfadoxine and 75 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrimethamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrimethamine</a>) administered at specific intervals after &quot;quickening&quot; (mother's recognition of fetal movement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A review demonstrated that three or more doses of IPTp-SP were associated with higher mean birthweight and fewer lower birthweights than two doses of IPTp-SP (20 percent reduction in low birthweight 95% CI 6-31). Thus, IPTp-SP is recommended for all pregnant women in high to moderate transmission areas, starting in the second trimester at each scheduled antenatal care visit until time of delivery, provided that the doses are given at least one month apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Women in low transmission regions may take two doses given in the second and third trimesters. Women with HIV taking cotrimoxazole do not need additional SP as cotrimoxazole prevents malaria along with HIV-related opportunistic infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Information on optimal dosing for HIV-infected pregnant women is still being sought, although the bulk of the data suggest that greater reduction in peripheral and placental parasitemia and a significant increase in mean birthweight are achieved with monthly IPT rather than the standard two-course regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/35,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38-40</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an area of intense malaria transmission in Kenya, monthly IPT was more efficacious in preventing placental malaria compared with a two-dose course among HIV-infected women (25 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized nonblinded study compared two doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine versus monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine given throughout pregnancy in 266 HIV-infected and 1626 HIV-uninfected women in Malawi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

From a logistic viewpoint, many women who were randomized to two doses of SP actually only received one, which was far inferior in efficacy. The authors suggested that monthly SP intermittent therapy may be a more effective strategy in reducing the risk of inadvertent underdosing and poor outcomes.</p><p/><p>Of note, the incidence of malaria in the above study was low, which was attributed to the additional use of insecticide-treated bed nets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This observation emphasizes the importance of these simple but effective interventions.</p><p>In 2004, the WHO recommended that HIV-infected pregnant women should receive at least three courses of IPT to achieve the same benefits that HIV-uninfected women appear to have with the standard two-dose regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In addition to defining the optimum dosing frequency, the amount of drug needed during pregnancy is still uncertain. A pharmacokinetic study found that the area under the curve (AUC) concentration for sulfadoxine was significantly shorter during pregnancy than in the postpartum state; however, HIV status itself had little influence on pharmacokinetic parameters in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Daily cotrimoxazole is as effective as SP at preventing clinical and placental malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Therefore, HIV-infected pregnant woman on cotrimoxazole need no additional IPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Pregnant women with low CD4 count or clinical features of immunosuppression should remain on cotrimoxazole during pregnancy.</p><p>Intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy is discussed further separately.

Consequently, the diagnosis of malaria may be overestimated and inappropriately treated. Conversely, if a diagnostic workup is pursued, a positive malaria smear may be misinterpreted as a cause for fever in an HIV-infected patient (or HIV-uninfected patient), when an alternative etiology is present. Furthermore, malaria infection and bacteremia may coexist in the same patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of malaria should be considered in all febrile patients who have traveled to or lived in malaria-endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Although we recommend malaria smears in patients with fever, a careful history and physical examination is required to look for alternative causes of fever (eg, typhoid). The differential diagnosis is particularly broad when evaluating a patient with advanced immunosuppression (eg, cryptococcosis, mycobacterial infections). If a patient's fever has not resolved after three days on antimalarial therapy, then an alternative etiology should be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two important factors are important to keep in mind when considering the diagnosis of HIV in malaria-endemic areas (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coinfection with HIV and malaria is common. One study of Ugandan adults with malaria demonstrated that the HIV seroprevalence rate was 31 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As discussed above, HIV may have a negative impact on malarial infection, leading to more symptomatic disease, even in individuals living in endemic areas. Therefore, the diagnosis of clinically apparent malaria infection in a patient from an endemic area should prompt routine HIV counseling and testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever may also be the presenting symptom of primary HIV infection. One study of 72 patients with acute HIV infection in Kenya demonstrated that 69 percent of patients had sought medical care for fever and 40 percent had received empiric malaria treatment; however, only 24 percent of febrile patients were tested for malaria parasites and all smear results were negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF MALARIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV infection may increase the burden of malaria by increasing susceptibility of patients to infection or by decreasing the response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In two studies in Uganda and Malawi, treatment failure was not associated with HIV serostatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, molecular genotyping assays in one study demonstrated that HIV-infected patients were more likely to have acquired new infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These data again suggest that HIV-infected patients may have increased susceptibility to infection. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Impact of HIV on malaria'</a> above.)</p><p>The treatment of malaria in HIV-infected patients is similar to treatment of HIV-uninfected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-uncomplicated-falciparum-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-severe-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of severe malaria&quot;</a>).

In the rodent parasite model, lopinavir and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=saquinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">saquinavir</a> also inhibited the preerythrocytic stage of parasite development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Therapeutic interventions directed at the preerythrocytic (intrahepatic) stage have the advantage of inhibiting the parasite while it is present in low numbers and before the initiation of bloodstream infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-malaria#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of malaria&quot;, section on 'Life cycle'</a>.)</p><p>In general, first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens in malaria-endemic areas usually include nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors rather than PIs. In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends combination ART for all pregnant and breastfeeding women, with efavirenz-based ART as a first-line regimen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lopinavir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lopinavir-ritonavir</a> as the alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. To examine if lopinavir-ritonavir provides an additional antimalarial benefit, an open-label randomized controlled study in Uganda compared lopinavir-ritonavir with efavirenz-based regimens for prevention of placental malaria among 391 HIV-infected pregnant women; there was no difference in placental malaria or birth outcomes, including low birthweight, neonatal death or preterm delivery, the incidence of maternal malaria, or prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>One study in Uganda noted that the risk of recurrent malaria for children with HIV treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artemether-and-lumefantrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artemether-lumefantrine</a> was lower among those receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lopinavir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lopinavir-ritonavir</a>&ndash;based regimens than among those receiving NNRTI-based regimens (28 versus 54 percent; hazard ratio 0.41; 95% CI 0.22-0.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-malaria/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was associated with higher serum lumefantrine levels on day 7, suggesting a longer duration of antimalarial protection. There was a greater number of serious adverse events in the lopinavir-ritonavir group (5.6 versus 2.3 percent); therefore, more safety studies may be needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">MALARIA PROPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, which is used for the prophylaxis of opportunistic infections such as <em>Pneumocystis</em>, also has efficacy in the prevention of malaria.

However, HIV and malaria coinfection most frequently occurs with <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> due to overlapping geographic distribution between this species and individuals who are infected with HIV. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coinfection with malaria is associated with a transient increase in HIV RNA. If viral loads are being used to monitor the response to antiretroviral therapy (ART), testing should be delayed for approximately two months if the patient has had a recent malaria infection. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Impact of malaria on HIV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV infection is associated with increased susceptibility, higher parasitemia, and an increased risk for recurrent malaria infection, particularly in patients with CD4 counts &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>.

The decision to institute trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis against malaria for patients with CD4 &gt;200 depends on transmission intensity, which varies by geography and season.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dual infection with HIV and malaria during pregnancy leads to adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. We recommend monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (1500 mg sulfadoxine and 75 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrimethamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrimethamine</a>) throughout pregnancy, starting in the second trimester in moderate and high transmission areas (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). HIV-infected patients on daily co-trimoxazole need not take sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.

An HIV-infected patient may have fever unrelated to malaria, even in the setting of a positive blood smear with low-level parasitemia. This may lead to an incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate therapy. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of malaria in HIV-infected patients is similar to treatment of HIV-uninfected individuals. However, the incidence of new infections may be higher and recrudescence of drug resistant parasites may also occur, so careful follow-up is necessary. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of malaria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiretroviral therapy decreases the incidence of malaria and so particular attention should be paid to administering ART to treatment candidates living in malaria-endemic areas, if resources are available.
