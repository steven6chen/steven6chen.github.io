These include genital ulcers, ocular disease, skin lesions, arthritis, and vascular, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease.</p><p>Most clinical manifestations of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome are believed to be due to vasculitis. Among the systemic vasculitides, Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is remarkable for its ability to involve blood vessels of all sizes &ndash; small, medium, and large &ndash; on both the arterial and venous sides of the circulation, with a predilection for the venous side.</p><p>The treatment of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-behcet-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several overarching principles that should be considered when managing patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The syndrome typically runs a relapsing and remitting course, and the goal of treatment is to promptly suppress inflammatory exacerbations and recurrences to prevent irreversible organ damage</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A coordinated multidisciplinary approach is necessary for optimal care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment choices should be individualized based on age, sex, type, and severity of organ involvement as well as patient preferences</p><p/><p>Given the clinical heterogeneity of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, the therapeutic approach is highly variable and is guided by the predominant disease manifestation.</p><p>Our approach is generally consistent with guidelines developed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. New guidelines have been proposed, and preliminary recommendations were presented at the EULAR meeting in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">ORGAN-BASED TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H146560331\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the clinical heterogeneity of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome and the unpredictable disease course, the management is tailored to the individual patient, taking into account the severity of symptoms and organ involvement along with the sex and age of the patient, as young males tend to have the more severe and complicated course compared with females and older patients, in general. The choice of therapy in active disease is dictated by the predominant disease manifestation.</p><p>The following discussion of treatment is organized by the disease manifestations, which include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucocutaneous manifestations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Mucocutaneous manifestations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral aphthae and genital ulcers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of oral and genital ulcers is guided by the severity of symptoms and the presence of other disease manifestations. The following is our general approach to drug therapy in patients with oral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genital ulcers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For isolated oral aphthae, we suggest initial treatment with topical corticosteroids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide cream (0.1% in Orabase). This should be applied three to four times daily and be used until pain from the ulcer ceases. Potent topical corticosteroids may also be used for genital ulcers. The efficacy of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of aphthous ulcers in Beh&ccedil;et syndrome was evaluated in a small study including 60 patients who were given either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> syrup or triamcinolone acetonide ointment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Improvements in the triamcinolone acetonide and phenytoin groups were 87 percent and 53 percent, respectively. Intralesional corticosteroid preparations for large ulcers can be employed in collaboration with a dermatologist. A typical preparation is triamcinolone (5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span>. Our approach to the use of topical therapies is generally consistent with that used for recurrent aphthous stomatitis and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis#H743303044\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrent aphthous stomatitis&quot;, section on 'Topical therapies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a> can also be used in combination with or as an alternative to topical corticosteroids. Topical sucralfate <span class=\"nowrap\">1g/5mL</span> four times daily as a mouthwash reduced pain, frequency, and healing time in a randomized controlled trial for oral ulcers in Beh&ccedil;et syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pimecrolimus</a> improved healing time in a randomized trial of 90 patients with genital aphthous ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although generally less effective, topical anesthetics can also provide temporary relief of discomfort if used prior to eating and performing dental hygiene. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis#H2068068876\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrent aphthous stomatitis&quot;, section on 'General measures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For prevention of recurrent oral and genital ulcers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> can be used 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in divided doses (titrated to a dose without gastrointestinal side effects). In places where 0.5 mg tablets are not available (eg, United States), doses in the range of 1.2 to 1.8 can be used. Data on the effects of colchicine for patients with minor oral ulcers or genital lesions are mixed, but generally more favorable for genital ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. In a randomized trial of 116 patients comparing colchicine with placebo, colchicine therapy was associated with a significant reductions in the number of genital ulcers and erythema nodosum in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A randomized crossover trial in 169 patients showed significant improvement in overall disease activity as well as oral aphthosis, genital aphthosis, pseudofolliculitis and erythema nodosum in patients treated with colchicine versus placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Colchicine is also used for patients with arthritis associated with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H62852733\" class=\"local\">'Arthritis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients may develop significant gastrointestinal intolerance of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> if the medication is taken at total doses higher than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic window and doses should be adjusted if adverse symptoms develop, as cytopenias and other complications may develop. Dose adjustment of colchicine is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Dose adjustments are found in the Lexicomp drug patient information topic within UpToDate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-gout-flares#H351173490\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of gout flares&quot;, section on 'Safety of colchicine'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When isolated oral aphthae or genital ulcers are refractory to topical corticosteroids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> or when multiple lesions are present, systemic glucocorticoids should be employed. An appropriate starting dose for mucocutaneous disease in the absence of other disease manifestations is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (or the equivalent with other glucocorticoids), with tapering of the dose to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> after one week and discontinuation of prednisone entirely over a two- to three-week period, assuming that the aphthae are no longer symptomatic. Some patients may require higher initial doses. Patients with recurrent oral aphthae may require longer periods of maintenance treatment with low-dose prednisone (eg, 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">General clinical experience with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome and extrapolation from the treatment of recurrent aphthous stomatitis suggest that systemic glucocorticoids are effective for oral aphthae and genital ulcers resistant to topical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Escalation of treatment with other medications for the management of oral and genital ulcers should be determined on a case-by-case basis. We generally reserve these options for patients in whom the combination of daily oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> and a daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose of more than 10 mg is required to control oral aphthae and genital lesions or if the adverse effects of prednisone <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> colchicine are intolerable even at lower doses. The choice of therapeutic options listed below and can also depend on the presence of other organ involvement. Adverse effects of individual therapeutic agents and patient preferences must also be taken into consideration. Options in order of preference include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azathioprine</a> &ndash; Azathioprine has been shown to improve oral and genital ulceration. In a randomized trial, 73 patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome were treated with either azathioprine (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) or placebo, with glucocorticoids available to both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. After two years, patients taking azathioprine had less frequent oral and genital ulcers. We generally start with azathioprine 50 mg daily. Azathioprine is increased as tolerated and with appropriate laboratory monitoring over four to six weeks to a maximum daily dose of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. Before the initiation of azathioprine, we perform genetic testing for mutations in the gene for thiopurine methyltransferase. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology and side effects of azathioprine when used in rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Pharmacogenetics and TPMT testing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors &ndash; Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>) have been beneficial for mucocutaneous disease in several case <span class=\"nowrap\">reports/series</span> and prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], as well as one randomized trial with etanercept [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. They should be used in combination with an oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> to help prevent development of potentially neutralizing antibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The efficacy of TNF-alpha inhibitors for mucocutaneous disease was demonstrated in a retrospective multicenter study of 124 patients with severe or refractory Beh&ccedil;et syndrome treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> (in 62 percent) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> (in 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition to an overall clinical response in 90 percent of patients, a clinical improvement was seen in 88 percent of patients with mucocutaneous disease. A randomized trial in which 40 patients with mucocutaneous disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arthritis were assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> (25 mg subcutaneously twice a week) or placebo injections for four weeks found that more patients on etanercept remained free of oral ulcers (45 percent versus 5 percent) and nodular skin lesions (85 versus 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of genital ulcers, likely due to the small size and relative infrequency of genital ulcers during the short study period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> &ndash; Although typically used for ocular manifestations, there is some evidence supporting the efficacy of cyclosporine for mucocutaneous disease. In a randomized trial with 96 patients with mucocutaneous manifestations, cyclosporine (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in divided doses) was superior to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> in the management of oral and genital ulcers as well as other skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, adverse effects due to cyclosporine were common and were reversible when the cyclosporine dose was reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Hypertension is common with cyclosporine treatment. Neurotoxicity is also frequently seen and may be difficult to differentiate from disease-related neurologic disease; thus, this agent is less preferred in patients with neurologic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3814117612\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Interferon alfa &ndash; Interferon alfa-2a and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interferon-alfa-2b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">interferon alfa-2b</a> (generally given three to six million units three times weekly) have been beneficial for mucocutaneous disease. This was shown in a randomized trial of 50 patients in which interferon alfa-2a significantly decreased the duration and pain of oral ulcers as well as the frequency of genital ulcers and papulopustular lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The mean frequency and duration of erythema nodosum-like lesions, thrombophlebitis, and articular symptoms also decreased, but not in a statistically significant fashion. In a systematic review of 32 original articles and four abstracts including 338 patients treated with interferon alfa-2a or alfa-2b, partial or complete responses were seen in 86 percent of the patients with mucocutaneous symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, flu-like symptoms and other toxicities, including depression, are not uncommon.

A randomized phase II trial including 111 patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome found that patients who received apremilast had a significant reduction in the number of oral ulcers at 12 weeks, as compared with those in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. More data are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of apremilast before routine use can be recommended for oral ulcers and, possibly, other disease manifestations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Thalidomide</a> &ndash; Given the generally greater efficacy of other agents for mucocutaneous Beh&ccedil;et syndrome and the significant risk of neuropathy and teratogenicity associated with thalidomide, thalidomide is now seldom used for this indication in practice. The use of thalidomide should be restricted to clinicians experienced in the management of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome and the use of this medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The efficacy of thalidomide monotherapy for mucocutaneous manifestations of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome was demonstrated in a trial with 96 patients who were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: thalidomide 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> thalidomide 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Only a minority of thalidomide-treated patients responded to treatment, and some manifestations of disease (erythema nodosum) actually worsened. In addition, 7 percent of the thalidomide-treated patients developed peripheral neuropathy, a condition that is often irreversible.</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> mofetil has not been found to be effective in the treatment of mucocutaneous manifestations. A trial of mycophenolate mofetil for the mucocutaneous manifestations of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome was terminated due to lack of efficacy in the first six patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, our authors may use mycophenolate mofetil in combination with TNF-alpha inhibitors for patients who do not tolerate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Cutaneous lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the exception of erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum, most other cutaneous manifestations of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome (acneiform and papulopustular lesions, nodules, superficial thrombophlebitis, and palpable purpura) respond well to the more moderate measures discussed above, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> and low to moderate doses of glucocorticoids.</p><p>The usual approach to cutaneous disease in Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is to begin with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> for mild manifestations (1 to 2 mg daily in divided doses) and to institute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (up to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> initially) for lesions that are refractory to colchicine. Prednisone doses maintained between 5 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> are usually sufficient to control most skin manifestations of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome.</p><p>Erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum require special consideration.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema nodosum &ndash; Because of the possibility of a dermal vasculitis underlying the clinical presentation of erythema nodosum, clinicians should consider moving quickly to systemic glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive medications if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> is ineffective. Infectious etiologies for erythema nodosum should also be ruled out before adding immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythema-nodosum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Erythema nodosum&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of a medium-vessel vasculitis through biopsy or by the clinical appearance of ulcerations of the erythema nodosum lesions is an indication for systemic glucocorticoid treatment combined with another immunosuppressive agent. In this setting, we suggest as initial therapy the combination of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (40 to 60 mg daily) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (50 mg daily). The prednisone dose is maintained at its initial level for one month and then tapered off over three to four months. Azathioprine is increased as tolerated over four to six weeks to a daily dose of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. Before the initiation of azathioprine, we suggest genetic testing for mutations in the gene for thiopurine methyltransferase. Treatment, particularly the rapidity of the prednisone taper, should be dictated by the clinical response (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology and side effects of azathioprine when used in rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Pharmacogenetics and TPMT testing'</a>).

Thus, extensive debridement of pyoderma in Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is discouraged. The treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum is reviewed in detail elsewhere.

When present, joint symptoms are usually accompanied by other manifestations of disease that dictate the intensity of treatment. The following is our general approach to drug therapy in patients with arthritis associated with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with arthritis with or without other non-organ-threatening disease (eg, mucocutaneous involvement), we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> 1 to 2 mg daily in divided doses.

Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> should be avoided as it has been associated with more episodes of neurologic involvement in patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/2,114,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,114,116</a>].</p><p>The management of neurologic manifestations of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is based on limited data from uncontrolled trials and expert opinion.

The disease appears to be more severe in young, male, and Middle-Eastern or Far-Eastern patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/133,134\" class=\"abstract_t\">133,134</a>]. However, for some patients, particularly those with predominantly mucocutaneous and articular manifestations, the disease burden dissipates with time and many patients can become asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. In a series of 2200 patients followed at a specialty clinic in Korea, only seven died from Beh&ccedil;et syndrome over a nine-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. The mortality in a cohort of 817 patients in France was 5 percent at a median follow-up of 7.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>]. </p><p>The greatest morbidity and mortality comes from neurologic, ocular, and large-vessel arterial or venous disease (causing pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, bowel perforation, superior and inferior vena cava syndrome, and cerebrovascular disease). In a 20-year follow-up of 387 Turkish patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, most were doing better at 20 years, with decreased activity of most manifestations other than central nervous system involvement and major-vessel disease; the latter manifestations may have their onset after 5 to 10 years of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>].</p><p>Mucocutaneous, articular, and ocular disease are often at their worst in the early years of disease, but central nervous system and large-vessel disease, if they develop, typically do so later in the disease course. Though disease activity may decline with passing years, disease burden may rise due to cumulative ocular, neurologic, or vascular damage. Pulmonary artery aneurysms and associated hemoptysis were previously associated with a very poor prognosis, but survival appears to have improved, possibly as the result of earlier recognition and treatment using glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive agents. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 26 patients followed at one center in Turkey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. The five-year survival for patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome and pulmonary artery aneurysms who were diagnosed and treated in 1992 or later was 80 versus 40 percent for 24 patients in whom the diagnosis was made prior to that year.</p><p>Ocular and neurologic lesions may improve with immunosuppressive therapy but are often not fully reversible. Without aggressive therapy, they generally progress. A significant proportion of patients with ocular disease, particularly those of Turkish and Japanese descent, suffer progressive vision loss.</p><p>The prognosis also varies with the type of neurologic process. Those with dural venous thrombosis or other nonparenchymal processes are less likely to have recurrent disease, disability, or premature death. By comparison, patients with parenchymal disease have a worse outcome and may follow a relapsing-remitting or progressive disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/114,137,138\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,137,138</a>]. As an example, in an observational study including 58 patients with neurologic Beh&ccedil;et syndrome in Iran, 84 percent had parenchymal and 16 percent had nonparenchymal disease. Among those with parenchymal involvement, 31 percent had a monophasic, 27 percent had a polyphasic, and 20 percent had a progressive disease course. Those with a progressive disease course had a significantly higher rate of brainstem atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>].</p><p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may help determine prognosis. In one study, roughly 90 percent of those with elevated CSF protein levels or CSF pleocytosis had additional neurologic events, progressive disability, or death during at least three years of follow-up. Only 25 to 30 percent of those with normal CSF protein levels suffered one such event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective study of 115 patients with neurologic Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, one-third of patients suffered relapses, and the risk of relapse was higher in patients with a positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51. Seven-year event-free survival was 53 percent. Risk factors for poor outcomes included motor symptoms at presentation and brainstem lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There was a trend towards better outcomes in patients treated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> compared with those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2965845037\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

A coordinated multidisciplinary approach is necessary for optimal care. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment is dictated both by the type of organ system involved and by the severity of disease within that organ system. Because many patients have more than one organ system involved, treatment is often guided by the degree of disease severity in the most critical organ. (See <a href=\"#H146560331\" class=\"local\">'Overall approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For oral aphthae and genital ulcers, we suggest initial treatment with topical corticosteroids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Topical anesthetics can also be added to provide temporary relief of discomfort prior to eating and performing dental hygiene. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Oral aphthae and genital ulcers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For prevention of recurrent oral and genital ulcers, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in divided doses (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In places where 0.5 mg tablets are not available (eg, United States), doses in the range of 1.2 to 1.8 mg can be used. When isolated oral aphthae or genital ulcers are refractory to topical corticosteroids and colchicine or when multiple lesions are present, we add systemic glucocorticoids typically at a starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Escalation of treatment with other medications should be determined on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Oral aphthae and genital ulcers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with arthritis with or without other non-organ-threatening disease (eg, mucocutaneous involvement), we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> 1 to 2 mg daily in divided doses (titrated to a dose without gastrointestinal side effects) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We may also use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for symptomatic relief of arthritic pain if not otherwise contraindicated. In patients whose arthritis is not controlled by colchicine, low-dose systemic glucocorticoids can be added. (See <a href=\"#H62852733\" class=\"local\">'Arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For refractory or persistent arthritis, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors instead of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with arthritis refractory to colchicine or azathioprine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> TNF-alpha inhibitors, other immunosuppressive agents such as interferon alfa or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> may be used.
