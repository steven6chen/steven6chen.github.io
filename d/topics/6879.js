The morbilliform exanthem accounts for approximately 95 percent of cutaneous drug reactions and drug-induced urticaria for approximately 5 percent.

The precise mechanisms by which drugs elicit a specific immune response are not completely understood and may involve different types of interaction between drugs and the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-pathogenesis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Interaction of drugs with the immune system'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs or their metabolites may act as haptens, form covalent bonds with a protein or peptide, and become antigenic. Haptenated proteins are then processed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to produce haptenated peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The hapten-peptide-MHC are then presented to na&iuml;ve, allergen-specific T cells. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs may directly interact with immune receptors and activate specific immune cells (the &quot;p-i concept&quot; or pharmacologic interactions of drugs with immune receptors). According to the p-i concept, chemically inert drugs, unable to bind covalently to peptides or proteins, can activate certain T cells if they fit with sufficient affinity into T cell receptors or MHC molecules.</p><p/><p>In delayed-type immune reactions, specific T cell clones of the CD4 T helper cell type 1 (Th1) or T helper cell type 2 (Th2) and CD8 subtypes orchestrate different forms of inflammation depending upon the cytokines produced and other types of cells that become involved, leading to four subcategories of type IV reactions (IVa to IVd) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75626\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75626 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Effector cells such as CD4 Th1 lymphocytes, CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes, macrophages, and nonspecific effector cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils may be involved in the elicitation phase, explaining some of the variability of the clinical manifestations of drug reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Exanthematous drug reactions appear to be driven by type IVc reactions, in which T cells act as effector cells. CD8 effector T cells emigrate to tissues and kill cells in a <span class=\"nowrap\">perforin/granzyme</span> B-, granulysin-, and FasL-directed manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Type IVc reactions also may occur in other drug hypersensitivity reactions, mostly in conjunction with other type IV reactions involving the recruitment and activation of monocytes, eosinophils, or neutrophils. Immunohistochemical and functional studies of drug-reactive T cells in patients with distinct forms of exanthems reveal that distinct T cell functions lead to different clinical phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The chronology of the onset and evolution of the skin lesions allow an approximate estimation of what type of pathomechanism and which drugs may be involved and may be helpful in clinical practice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77196\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77196 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DRUG%2F86511\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86511 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55254030\"><span class=\"h2\">Eliciting drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large number of drugs may induce delayed-type, T cell-mediated immune reactions. Some drugs act as haptens, bind to macromolecules, and then become full antigens. Examples include penicillins, cephalosporins, and agents with sulfhydryl groups. Known antigens include the beta-lactam ring, aminobenzyl side chains, and methoxyimino side chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The exact antigenic moiety is not known for most drugs, such as antibiotics, macrolides, quinolones, tuberculostatic agents, calcium-antagonists, and protein pump inhibitors.</p><p>For other drugs, biotransformation is necessary to form reactive metabolites. Examples include the aromatic sulfonamides (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>), anticonvulsant drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and paracetamol.

These reactions may occur with a large variety of drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77196\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77196 \">table 1</a>). Genetic predisposition, underlying viral diseases (eg, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus), and the administration of multiple medications increase the risk of exanthematous drug eruption.
