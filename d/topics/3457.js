In addition, there are few treatment options. Although <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is not likely to shorten your life, it can have a profound effect on your quality of life.</p><p>More detailed information about <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (systemic exertion intolerance disease)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome (systemic exertion intolerance disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent fatigue is the hallmark of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typically, the fatigue develops suddenly, often following an infection such as upper respiratory infection or mononucleosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-mono-in-adults-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Infectious mononucleosis (mono) in adults and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have overwhelming fatigue and a number of additional symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical activity may make the symptoms worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typically, people who develop <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> were functioning at a high level previously. You do not have a history of worrying excessively about being ill. You do not have multiple physical complaints, such as chronic back ache, chronic headache, and so on.</p><p/><p>Many, if not most, people with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> have physical symptoms for which no cause can be found with an examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> testing. In addition, you may have one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory and concentration problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness when you stand up </p><p/><p>The general nature of symptoms and lack of an identifiable cause can make coping with this disease difficult. People may suspect that you are making up the symptoms, and you may wonder if there is really anything wrong with you. Consequently, feelings of anger, frustration, and depression are common with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>.</p><p>The symptoms and signs of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> can also occur with other medical conditions. Thus, it is essential to see a health care practitioner and have other potential causes ruled out. However, <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> can also occur at the same time as other illnesses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">POSSIBLE CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), is not known. Past explanations for <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> have included chronic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, Lyme disease, allergies, chemical sensitivities, body-wide yeast infection, and other viruses. However, in carefully done research studies, none of these has been proven to cause <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (systemic exertion intolerance disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several other potential causes of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> are being studied. There is some evidence suggesting that <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> may be an immune disorder.</p><p>Another line of research has focused on chronic hypotension (low blood pressure) caused by a problem in the nervous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are some groups of people who seem to be at higher risk for developing chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is diagnosed more often in young and middle-aged adults than in children or older adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is diagnosed about twice as often in women as in men, and is also more likely to be diagnosed in white (non-Hispanic) people compared with other ethnic groups.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), is usually diagnosed based upon a medical history and physical examination. Blood or urine testing may be done to rule out other conditions but are not needed to diagnose <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>. If sleep apnea is suspected by the clinician, a sleep study may be recommended.</p><p>In order to be diagnosed with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> you must have unexplained, persistent, or relapsing fatigue, plus a number of the additional problems listed above. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p>If you have unexplained chronic fatigue but few, if any, of these additional symptoms, you may have unexplained chronic fatigue. This is considered to be a different problem and may be managed differently than <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no cure for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID); the goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms of fatigue and help you to cope. Many therapies have been tried in <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> but none has been consistently successful.</p><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and graded exercise appear to be the most effective treatments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome (systemic exertion intolerance disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBT is a type of therapy that can help to reduce symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>. It typically involves a series of one-hour sessions with a psychotherapist or counselor. The sessions focus on discussing beliefs and behaviors that can interfere with your recovery. CBT will not cure <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> but it can help you to cope better with your fatigue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Graded exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prolonged lack of exercise can also worsen <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>. Experts recommend beginning with gentle exercises and slowly increasing the intensity. Working with a professional trainer who is familiar with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> may be of benefit.</p><p>There is no role for antibiotics in the treatment of most patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> and there is the potential for serious side effects from prolonged use of antibiotics.</p><p>If you happen to have a positive blood test for Lyme disease, you or your clinician may be tempted to try a course of antibiotics. A positive Lyme test, however, merely indicates that you have been exposed to the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. It does not mean that your symptoms are necessarily related to Lyme disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Lyme disease symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment for fibromyalgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibromyalgia is a condition that causes muscle and joint pain without an identifiable cause. Given the similarity between <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> and fibromyalgia, many clinicians believe that they are the same disease with different symptoms. Some clinicians will treat both conditions if the diagnosis is unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Fibromyalgia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Unproven treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments that are <strong>not</strong> proven to improve symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications &ndash; These include antidepressants, antibiotics (eg, doxycycline), antiviral drugs (eg, acyclovir), glucocorticoids (also called steroids), and antihistamines used to treat heartburn (eg, ranitidine)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin, mineral, or herbal supplements &ndash; These include magnesium, evening primrose oil, vitamin B12, and bovine (cow) or porcine (pig) liver extract</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exclusion diets, in which certain foods are eliminated or minimized</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removal of dental fillings</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVING WITH SYSTEMIC EXERTION INTOLERANCE DISEASE/CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although no specific treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID) has been established, it is important to understand that <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is not a new disease and that increasing knowledge and experience are being gained with the condition. Key points to remember include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is variable, but the symptoms are real, and the condition can be completely incapacitating. Because there are no laboratory or other tests to prove the existence of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> many people struggle with the validity of their disease (as do their health care practitioners, family members, friends, and employers).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no point to debating whether symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> originate in your mind or are the result of a not-yet identified abnormality. If the cause is in your mind, the symptoms are no less real (a difficult concept for some patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> their families). If the cause is an abnormality in your body, it is not yet known how to find it or treat it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most people with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> have some degree of depression. Depression can be successfully managed, and treatment can help people with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> to cope better. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-treatment-options-for-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Depression treatment options for adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Research into the course of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> has yielded somewhat conflicting results. Some patients have an improvement in their symptoms over time while others worsen. Regardless of its long-term prognosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> does not result in organ failure or death.</p><p>The most important factor in your ability to successfully cope with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is establishing a strong relationship with an experienced health care practitioner. This should include trust on both sides and an understanding that <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is both real and disabling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare practitioner is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=4007\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
