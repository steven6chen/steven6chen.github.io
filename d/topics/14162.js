The medical consultant may be seeing the patient at the request of the surgeon or may be the primary care clinician assessing the patient prior to consideration of a surgical referral. The goal of the evaluation of the healthy patient is to detect unrecognized disease and risk factors that may increase the risk of surgery above baseline and to propose strategies to reduce this risk.</p><p>The evaluation of healthy patients prior to surgery is reviewed here. Preoperative assessments for specific systems issues and surgical procedures are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-principles-of-medical-consultation-and-perioperative-medicine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the principles of medical consultation and perioperative medicine&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cataract-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cataract in adults&quot;, section on 'Preoperative medical evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the overall risk of surgery is extremely low in healthy individuals. Therefore, the ability to stratify risk by commonly performed evaluations is limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening questionnaire</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening questions appear on many standard institutional preoperative evaluation forms. One validated screening instrument, derived from 100 patients, comprises 17 questions that allowed nurses to identify those patients who would benefit from a formal preoperative evaluation by an anesthesiologist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66690 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The questions chosen for this questionnaire were devised to detect preexisting conditions shown to be associated with perioperative adverse events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of commonly employed and validated indices consider age as a minor component of preoperative coronary risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some studies have found a small increased risk of surgery associated with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In a review of 50,000 older adult patients, for example, the risk of mortality with elective surgery increased from 1.3 percent for those under 60 years of age to 11.3 percent in the 80- to 89-year-old age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among 1.2 million Medicare patients undergoing elective surgery, mortality risk increased linearly with age for most surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Operative mortality for patients 80 years and older was more than twice that of patients 65 to 69 years old. However, age was not a significant predictor of cardiac complications after multivariable analysis in the cohort of patients used to derive a revised cardiac risk index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In addition to the minor influence of age on perioperative cardiac risk, there is more robust literature supporting age as an independent risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications. Age was one of the most important patient-related predictors of pulmonary risk, even after adjusting for common age-related comorbidities, in a systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, some studies have found little relation between age and mortality rates due to surgery. One study reported the outcomes of surgery in 795 patients over 90 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. No patients were Class I as classified by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87504 \">table 2</a>); 80 percent were ASA Class III or greater. Despite higher perioperative mortality rates in older adults, survival at two years was no different than the actuarial survival in matched patients not undergoing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A larger study of 4315 patients also found a higher perioperative complication and mortality rate in older individuals, but the mortality rate was low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among 31 patients age 100 years and older undergoing surgery requiring anesthesia, perioperative and one-year mortality rates were similar to matched peers from the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>After adjusting for comorbidities more common with age, the impact of age on perioperative outcomes is modest. Much of the risk associated with age is due to increasing numbers of comorbidities, which may include cognitive impairment, functional impairment, malnutrition, and frailty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Geriatric patients may benefit from preoperative assessments in those areas, but age should not be used as the sole criterion to guide preoperative testing or to withhold a surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A <a href=\"http://www.riskcalculator.facs.org/&amp;token=NZ+Wv3Krh3AGAR2UOebDuE641/7yb2OkIqyRjwToRzmxorsAXZVYUgJO0wvN/RXm&amp;TOPIC_ID=4816\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">risk calculator</a> developed by the American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program may be helpful in assessing preoperative risk in an older patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should be asked about their exercise capacity as part of the preoperative evaluation. Exercise capacity is an important determinant of overall perioperative risk; patients with good exercise tolerance generally have low risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Initial preoperative evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association guideline on preoperative cardiac evaluation recommends no testing for patients with good exercise capacity (at least 4 metabolic equivalents [METs]) regardless of the risk of the planned procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F96563\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96563 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients&rsquo; ability to expend &ge;4 METs can be assessed by estimates from activities of daily living; activities that expend &ge;4 METS include the ability to climb up a flight of stairs, walk up a hill, walk at ground level at 4 miles per hour, or perform heavy work around the house [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, more formal activity scales can be used. An observational study of 87 patients found that, compared with the Duke Activity Status Index, subjective assessment by clinicians generally underestimated exercise capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In general, healthy patients who can perform these activities as part of their daily routine have a low risk for major postoperative complications. This was illustrated in a study of 600 consecutive patients undergoing major surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The investigators defined poor exercise capacity as the inability to either walk four blocks or climb two flights of stairs. Patients reporting poor exercise capacity had twice as many serious postoperative complications as those who reported good exercise capacity (20 versus 10 percent, respectively). There was also a difference in cardiovascular complications (10 versus 5 percent), but not in total pulmonary complications (9 versus 6 percent).</p><p>The importance of functional capacity was confirmed objectively in another report of 847 patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In this study, poor exercise capacity, confirmed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing, was a stronger predictor of all-cause mortality than any of the conventional cardiac risk factors of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should obtain a history of medication use for all patients before surgery and should specifically inquire about over-the-counter, complementary, and alternative medications. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with an increased risk of perioperative bleeding. Specific inquiry about use of complementary and alternative medications should also be part of the preoperative assessment. A detailed discussion of perioperative medication management is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrary to popular belief, in noncardiac surgery, obesity is not a risk factor for most major adverse postoperative outcomes, with the exception of pulmonary embolism. None of the published and widely disseminated cardiac risk indices for noncardiac surgery include obesity as a risk factor for postoperative cardiac complications.</p><p>Representative studies related to postoperative mortality in noncardiac surgery include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a matched case control study of 1962 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, obesity was not associated with increased mortality (1.1 percent in obese patients versus 1.2 percent in controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large, multi-institutional, prospective cohort of 118,707 patients undergoing non-bariatric general surgery, obesity was inversely associated with postoperative mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.99), a phenomenon termed the &ldquo;obesity paradox&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The authors suggest that the obese state carries a low-grade, chronic inflammatory that may be &ldquo;primed&rdquo; to mount an appropriate inflammatory and immune response to the stress of surgery, in addition to supplying more nutritional reserve.</p><p/><p>Other studies relating to complications in noncardiac surgery found that obesity increases rates for wound infections but has no effect on other postoperative complications except for postoperative deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/6,18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18-23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, in cardiac surgery, some studies have shown higher complication rates for obese patients, including increased hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], wound infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], prolonged mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and atrial arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6631824\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstructive sleep apnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the increased risks of perioperative morbidity and the potential for altered anesthetic management, it is reasonable to screen patients for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) before surgery with one of several validated screening instruments. OSA increases the risk for postoperative medical complications including hypoxemia, respiratory failure, unplanned reintubation, and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Most patients with OSA are undiagnosed. The prevalence of previously undetected OSA is particularly high in patients preparing for bariatric surgery. The ASA recommends screening for OSA before noncardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A detailed discussion of the perioperative risks and the role of screening for OSA is presented elsewhere.

Screening for alcohol misuse before surgery will identify a subset of patients at increased risk for postoperative medical complications. While the benefit of directed alcohol cessation programs before surgery is not well-established in the literature, there is little apparent risk to such a strategy. The preoperative period also serves as an opportunity to identify patients who misuse alcohol and are candidates for intervention as part of primary care follow-up after surgery.</p><p>In a study of 9176 male US veterans, a screening questionnaire for alcohol misuse administered at any time within one year before surgery accurately stratified risk of postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. There was a continuous relationship between postoperative complications and risk scores using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53246 \">table 3</a>). Surgical site infections, other infections, and cardiopulmonary complications each increased across the strata of risk groups based on alcohol use patterns. A similarly conducted trial of the AUDIT-C questionnaire before total joint arthroplasty revealed comparable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Patients with high AUDIT-C scores (9 to 12 of 12 possible points) within the year before surgery also have longer lengths of stay, more ICU days, and higher unplanned reoperation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Most trials of alcohol cessation interventions have been conducted in the nonoperative setting; a small study in patients undergoing colorectal surgery reported a beneficial effect of alcohol screening on postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The optimal period of cessation is unknown but at least four weeks of abstinence are required to reverse selected physiologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365945152\"><span class=\"h2\">Illicit drug use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to provide appropriate perioperative care, it is helpful to ask patients about illicit drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients with chronic opioid use may have developed tolerance and require higher than usual doses in the intraoperative and postoperative period. Patients who abuse opioids, barbiturates, or amphetamines are at risk for drug withdrawal in the postoperative period.

As more tests are ordered, the likelihood of a false-positive test increases; a screening panel containing 20 independent tests in a patient with no disease will yield at least one abnormal result 64 percent of the time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60009 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Thus, the predictive value of abnormal test results is low in healthy patients with a low prevalence of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55083\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55083 \">table 5</a>). Aside from possibly causing patient alarm, the additional testing prompted by false-positive screening tests leads to unnecessary costs, risks, and a potential delay of surgery. In addition, clinicians often fail to act upon abnormal test results from routine preoperative testing, thereby creating an additional medicolegal risk.</p><p>A review of studies of routine preoperative testing pooled data and estimated the incidence of abnormalities that affect patient management and the positive and negative likelihood ratios for a postoperative complication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75939 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. For nearly all potential laboratory studies, a normal test did not substantially reduce the likelihood of a postoperative complication (the negative likelihood ratio approached 1.0). Positive likelihood ratios were modest, and they exceeded 3.0 for only three tests (hemoglobin, renal function, and electrolytes); however, clinical evaluation can predict most patients with an abnormal result. This was illustrated by the low incidence of a change in preoperative management based on an abnormal test result (0 to 3 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When laboratory tests are felt to be necessary, it is reasonable to use test results that were performed and were normal within the past four months, unless there has been an interim change in clinical status. The validity of this approach was illustrated in an observational study which investigated the usefulness of 7549 preoperative tests performed at the time of admission in 1109 patients undergoing elective surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In 47 percent of cases, the same tests had been performed within the previous year. When repeated at admission:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of 3096 previously normal tests (performed a median of two months prior to admission), only 13 (0.4 percent) values were outside a range considered acceptable for surgery, and most of these patients had a change in clinical history that predicted the abnormality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of 461 previously abnormal tests, when repeated at admission, only 78 (17 percent) remained outside a range considered acceptable for surgery, suggesting that it is useful to repeat abnormal tests in the immediate preoperative period.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While preoperative laboratory testing is not routinely indicated, selective testing is appropriate in specific circumstances, including patients with known underlying diseases or risk factors that would affect operative management or increase risk, and specific high-risk surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Specific laboratory studies commonly ordered for preoperative evaluation include a complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function, blood glucose, liver function studies, hemostasis evaluation, and urinalysis. These tests are discussed below with indications for their use in specific populations and surgeries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Complete blood count</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Hemoglobin/hematocrit</strong></span> &ndash;<strong> </strong>A baseline hemoglobin measurement is suggested for all patients 65 years of age or older who are undergoing major surgery and for younger patients undergoing major surgery that is expected to result in significant blood loss. By contrast, hemoglobin measurement is not necessary for those undergoing minor surgery unless the history suggests anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Preoperative anemia is common; a cohort study of more than 200,000 patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery found preoperative anemia (defined as a hematocrit of less than 39 percent in men and 36 percent in women) in 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Postoperative mortality at 30 days was higher in patients with anemia (odds ratio [OR] 1.42, 95% CI 1.31-1.54). The risk was similar among those with mild and moderate to severe anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The data cannot distinguish whether an abnormal hematocrit serves as a marker for coexistent disease that increases mortality risk, or whether the anemia itself increases physiologic stresses and therefore complication rates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The observation that outcomes do not differ for patients undergoing hip surgery who were randomly assigned to either liberal or restrictive transfusion policies suggests that anemia is a marker for risk, rather than the cause of morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. It remains unclear if the increased risk due to anemia is modifiable by interventions aimed at correcting the hematocrit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>White blood cell count and platelets</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>The frequency of significant unsuspected white blood cell or platelet abnormalities is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. It is reasonable to measure platelet count when neuraxial anesthesia (spinal or epidural) is planned. Unlike the hemoglobin concentration, however, there is little rationale to support baseline testing of either. Nevertheless, obtaining a complete blood count, including white count and platelet measurement, can be recommended if the cost is not substantially greater than the cost of a hemoglobin concentration alone. There may be some costs incurred due to follow-up of false-positive results; however, with respect to platelet counts, these costs do not appear to be substantial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is appropriate to obtain a serum creatinine concentration in patients over the age of 50 undergoing intermediate- or high-risk surgery, although there is no clear consensus on this point. It should also be ordered when hypotension is likely, or when nephrotoxic medications will be used.</p><p>Mild to moderate renal impairment is usually asymptomatic; the prevalence of an elevated creatinine among asymptomatic patients with no history of renal disease is only 0.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/36,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,54</a>]. However, the prevalence increases with age. In one study, for example, the prevalence among unselected patients aged 46 to 60 was 9.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>In the revised cardiac risk index, a serum creatinine &gt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> was one of six independent factors that predicted postoperative cardiac complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Renal insufficiency is also an independent risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and a major predictor of postoperative mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Renal insufficiency necessitates dosage adjustment of some medications that may be used perioperatively (eg, muscle relaxants).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrolytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine electrolyte determinations are NOT recommended unless the patient has a history that increases the likelihood of an abnormality. The frequency of unexpected electrolyte abnormalities is low (0.6 percent in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. While preoperative hypernatremia is associated with an increase in perioperative 30-day morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], the relationship between most electrolyte derangements and operative morbidity is not clear. Furthermore, clinicians can predict most abnormalities based on history (for example, current use of a diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB], or known chronic kidney disease).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood glucose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine measurement of blood glucose is NOT recommended for healthy patients. Unexpected abnormal blood glucose results do not often influence perioperative management. As an example, one study evaluated the benefit of routine laboratory testing in 1010 presumably healthy patients undergoing cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Eight patients had unexpected elevations in preoperative serum glucose; only one of these patients developed significant postoperative hyperglycemia, and this was not recognized until after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> was started. No patient in this study benefited from routine preoperative measurement of serum glucose.</p><p>Also, the frequency of glucose abnormalities increases with age; almost 25 percent of patients over age 60 had an abnormal value in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Most controlled studies have not found a relationship between operative risk and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/2,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,55</a>], except in patients undergoing vascular surgery or coronary artery bypass grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. While the revised cardiac risk index identified diabetes as a risk factor for postoperative cardiac complications, only patients with insulin-treated diabetes were at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There is limited evidence that asymptomatic hyperglycemia, in a patient not previously known to have diabetes, increases surgical risk. The rate of asymptomatic hyperglycemia in unselected surgical patients is low; in one report, the incidence was only 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. A systematic review examined the relationship between preoperative blood glucose and A1c values in patients without known diabetes and postoperative complications after noncardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Among 22 eligible studies, no high-quality tests supported a role for routine preoperative screening in otherwise healthy patients. Exceptions were an increased risk of cardiac complications after vascular surgery and an increased risk for infectious complications after orthopedic surgery, among patients with abnormal preoperative blood glucose or A1c.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine liver enzyme testing is NOT recommended. Unexpected liver enzyme abnormalities are uncommon, occurring in only 0.3 percent of patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a pooled data analysis, only 0.1 percent of all routine preoperative liver function tests changed preoperative management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75939 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In a study of the NSQIP database, among 25,149 patient with no comorbidities, the relative risk for major postoperative complications among patients who received preoperative liver function tests, when compared with those with no testing, approached one (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.42-2.08) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Severe liver function test abnormalities among patients with cirrhosis or acute liver disease are associated with increased surgical morbidity and mortality, but no data suggest that mild abnormalities among patients with no known liver disease have a similar impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Clinically significant liver disease would most likely be suspected on the basis of the history and physical examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Tests of hemostasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine preoperative tests of hemostasis are NOT recommended. If the history, physical examination, and family history do not suggest the presence of a bleeding disorder, no additional laboratory testing is required. If the evaluation suggests the presence of a bleeding disorder, appropriate screening tests should be performed, including prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and platelet count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. For some bleeding disorders (eg, inherited platelet disorder, hemophilia carrier), additional tests may be required to establish a diagnosis and identify the degree of abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative assessment of hemostasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unexpected significant abnormalities of the PT or PTT are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/36,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,53</a>]. Inherited coagulation defects are quite rare. For example, the incidence of hemophilia A and B among men is 1:5000 and 1:30,000, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Nearly all of these cases would be evident based on clinical presentation prior to the preoperative medical evaluation. In addition, the relationship between an abnormal result and the risk of perioperative hemorrhage is not well-defined but appears to be quite low, particularly in those who are thought to have a low risk of hemorrhage on the basis of history and physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. Even among neurosurgical patients, for whom a small amount of unanticipated bleeding could cause substantial morbidity, the medical history is the most useful screening test for bleeding diathesis. In a study of 11,804 patients undergoing spinal or intracranial surgery, a medical history that suggested risk for bleeding complications was substantially more sensitive that PT or PTT values in predicting need for transfusion, unplanned reoperation, and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>In a pooled data analysis, an abnormal PT had a positive likelihood ratio of 0 for predicting a postoperative complication and a negative likelihood ratio of 1.01 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75939 \">table 6</a>); in no case did the finding of an abnormal PT change patient management or modify the likelihood of a complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Similarly, the bleeding time is not useful in assessing the risk of perioperative hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinalysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine urinalysis is NOT recommended preoperatively for most surgical procedures. The theoretical reason to obtain a preoperative urinalysis is detection of unsuspected urinary tract infection. Urinary tract infections have the potential to cause bacteremia and postsurgical wound infections, particularly with prosthetic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Patients with positive urinalysis and urine culture are generally treated with antibiotics and proceed with surgery without delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. However, it is unclear whether a positive preoperative urinalysis and culture with subsequent antibiotic treatment prevent postsurgical infection. One study found no difference in wound infection between patients with normal and abnormal urinalysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Another study found that patients with asymptomatic urinary tract infection detected by urinalysis had an increased risk of wound infection postoperatively, despite treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>A cost-effectiveness analysis estimated that 4.58 wound infections in nonprosthetic knee operations may be prevented annually by the use of routine urinalysis, at a cost of $1,500,000 per wound infection prevented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Asymptomatic renal disease can be detected by measurement of serum creatinine in selected patients.

We suggest pregnancy testing in all reproductive-age women prior to surgery. The patient may elect to cancel elective surgery, or may decide in collaboration with her clinicians to undertake a different, lower-risk surgery than originally planned. In addition, anesthetic technique differs for pregnant women, and there may be risks to the fetus if a pregnancy goes undetected before surgery and anesthesia.</p><p>Guidelines in the United Kingdom recommend always asking about the possibility of pregnancy before surgery and, if pregnancy is possible after history-taking, offering a pregnancy test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. The ASA recommends that clinicians offer pregnancy testing for women of childbearing age if the results would alter management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. While these guidelines provide some discretion in deciding which women to test, it is often not possible to reliably exclude pregnancy based on medical history-taking alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Many institutions require pregnancy testing for all reproductive age women before surgery. There is low risk to this approach; false-positives are rare, testing is inexpensive, and the results return rapidly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of early pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Detection of hCG'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROCARDIOGRAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest NOT ordering an electrocardiogram (ECG) for asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk surgical procedures. ECGs have a low likelihood of changing perioperative management in the absence of known cardiac disease. The prevalence of abnormal ECGs increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Important ECG abnormalities in patients younger than 45 years with no known cardiac disease are very infrequent.</p><p>The 2014 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> Guidelines on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation state that ECG is not useful in asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Similarly, the European Society of Cardiology 2014 preoperative guidelines do not recommend ECG in patients without risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>The 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines recommend a preoperative resting 12-lead ECG for patients with known coronary artery disease, significant arrhythmia, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease or other significant structural heart disease, except for those undergoing low-risk surgery (risk of major adverse cardiac event &lt;1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. A preoperative resting ECG can also be considered for asymptomatic patients undergoing surgery with elevated risk (risk of major adverse cardiac event &ge;1 percent). Preoperative evaluation of patients with known cardiovascular disease or risk factors is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is uncertain whether the preoperative approach to obese patients should differ from that of the general population in regard to ECGs. This is discussed separately.

In these patients, the chest radiograph may indicate undiagnosed heart failure, cardiac chamber enlargement, or abnormal pulmonary vascularity suggestive of pulmonary hypertension, warranting further cardiovascular investigation. The relationship between findings on chest radiograph and perioperative morbidity are not well-defined in these populations, however, and studies are not available that indicate that preoperative radiography changes perioperative outcomes. Thus, we do not suggest routine chest radiographs in severely obese patients, unless additional criteria such as poor exercise tolerance and risk factors for coronary artery disease are present.</p><p>Preoperative chest radiographs add little to the clinical evaluation in identifying patients at risk for perioperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The risk factors included age over 60 years or clinical findings consistent with cardiac or pulmonary disease. No risk factors were evident in 368 patients; of these, only one (0.3 percent) had an abnormal chest radiograph, which did not affect the surgery.

We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

Preoperative tests usually lead to false-positive results, unnecessary costs, and a potential delay of surgery. Preoperative tests should not be performed unless there is a clear clinical indication. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A simple screening questionnaire can be helpful in the preoperative evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66690 \">table 1</a>). Important potential risk factors to discuss with the patient include age, exercise capacity, alcohol, smoking, illicit drug use, and medication use. Obesity is not a risk factor for most major adverse postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, with the exception of thromboembolic events. Clinicians should also inquire about personal or family history of complications from anesthesia and screen for symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine preoperative laboratory tests have not been shown to improve patient outcomes among healthy patients undergoing surgery. In addition, routine testing in healthy patients has poor predictive value, leading to false-positive test results <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased medicolegal risk for not following up on abnormal test results. (See <a href=\"#H27897960\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for selective testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest baseline hemoglobin measurement for all patients 65 years of age or older who are undergoing major surgery and for younger patients undergoing surgery that is expected to result in significant blood loss (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Hemoglobin measurement is not necessary for younger patients undergoing minor surgery unless the history suggests anemia. For other healthy patients, we suggest NOT performing routine hemoglobin, white blood count, or platelet measurements (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Complete blood count'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the revised cardiac risk index, a serum creatinine &gt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> predicted postoperative cardiac complications. We suggest NOT obtaining a serum creatinine concentration, except in the following patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>)&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Renal function'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients over the age of 50 undergoing intermediate or high risk surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Younger patients suspected of having renal disease, when hypotension is likely during surgery, or when nephrotoxic medications will be used</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest NOT testing for serum electrolytes, blood glucose, liver function, hemostasis, or urinalysis in the healthy preoperative patient (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We suggest pregnancy testing in all reproductive age women prior to surgery, rather than use of history-taking alone to determine pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest NOT ordering an electrocardiogram (ECG) for asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk surgical procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">According to the 2014 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guidelines, a resting 12-lead ECG should be part of the evaluation in patients with known coronary artery disease, significant arrhythmia, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, or other significant structural heart disease, except for those undergoing low-risk surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A preoperative resting ECG can be considered for asymptomatic patients undergoing surgery with elevated risk (risk of major adverse cardiac event &ge;1 percent). This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Initial preoperative evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that clinicians NOT order routine preoperative chest radiographs or pulmonary function tests in the healthy patient (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We suggest obtaining a preoperative chest radiograph in patients with cardiopulmonary disease and those older than 50 years of age who are undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery or upper <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/thoracic</span> surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
