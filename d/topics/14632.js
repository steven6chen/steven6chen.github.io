In one retrospective series, 56 percent of injuries occurred in a motor vehicle crash, while 39 percent were the result of auto-pedestrian collisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The majority of patients with pulmonary contusions have associated thoracic injuries (eg, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and fractures of the bony thorax) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. While flail chest and scapular fractures are uncommon in children, when present, they are typically associated with pulmonary contusion as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chest wall injuries after blunt trauma in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More than 80 percent of children with pulmonary contusion also have extrathoracic injuries. While mortality for children with pulmonary contusion in one series was 22 percent, the cause of death was attributable to brain injury, hemorrhage, or multiple organ system injury in all cases rather than the contusion itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary contusion results when kinetic energy is transmitted to the pulmonary parenchyma. The lungs are damaged in the following ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhage occurs when deceleration at different rates, such as occurs in a motor vehicle crash, causes shearing of lighter alveolar tissue from heavier bronchial structures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Energy transmitted to the liquid-gas interface of the alveolar membrane and the intraalveolar air disrupts the lipid bilayer, resulting in increased cell membrane permeability and extravasation of fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rebound or overexpansion of intrapulmonary air, after a pressure wave passes, overstretches and damages lung parenchyma.</p><p/><p>Damage to lung tissue, including extravasation of fluid into the interstitium and inactivation of surfactant, results in alveolar collapse, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and hypoxemia.</p><p>The clinical features of pulmonary contusion in children are also influenced by mechanical differences in the chest wall, which is more compliant and elastic than that of an adult. As a result, more kinetic energy can be transmitted to the intrathoracic structures without bony injury. For this reason, pulmonary contusion without rib fracture occurs more often in children than adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46184914\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND STABILIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any significantly injured child, priority is given to the maintenance of oxygenation, ventilation, and cardiovascular support and the management of immediately life-threatening injuries that frequently coexist with pulmonary contusions such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, or hemorrhagic shock (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 1</a>). Whenever, possible trauma resuscitation for the unstable child should be performed in a pediatric trauma center and ongoing cared directed by a trauma surgeon with pediatric expertise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Primary survey'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-stabilization-of-children-with-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and stabilization of children with thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Careful physical examination should note signs of respiratory distress (ie, increased respiratory rate or retractions), abnormal breath sounds, or signs of chest wall injury (ie, focal tenderness, swelling, abrasions, or paradoxical movement). Pulse oximetry should be monitored for all patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Secondary survey'</a>.)</p><p>Initial laboratory testing in patients with pulmonary contusion is the same as for any seriously injured child and is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Laboratory studies'</a>.) </p><p>Arterial blood gas measurements are unnecessary if pulse oximetry suggests no increased alveolar to arterial oxygen gradient because PaO<sub>2</sub> measurement will not change initial management. </p><p>Chest radiography should be performed for all children with suspected pulmonary contusion and all significantly injured children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Screening radiographs'</a>.) </p><p>The approach to the unstable injured child is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Primary survey'</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial presentation of children with pulmonary contusion is often dominated by clinical features associated with extrathoracic injuries. Nevertheless, pulmonary contusion should be suspected in any child with significant blunt force to the thorax, whether or not there are signs of respiratory distress or chest wall injury.</p><p>Although the majority of children with pulmonary contusion have some degree of tachypnea, hypoxemia, or respiratory distress at initial presentation, these features may be subtle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example, among children with pulmonary contusion in one series, mild tachypnea (respiratory rate between 20 and 30 breaths per minute) was noted in 16 percent, while another 16 percent had respiratory rates over 30 breaths per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Decreased breath sounds, rales, or rhonchi may be noted on physical examination. Limited evidence suggests that these abnormal findings may be absent in more than half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Similarly, the majority of children may <strong>not</strong> have signs of chest wall injury, such as rib or soft tissue tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary contusion is primarily a clinical diagnosis and should be suspected in any child with a history of chest trauma and any one of the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachypnea </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoxemia (eg, pulse oximetry &lt;95 percent in room air or high alveolar to arterial oxygen gradient based upon arterial blood gas measurement (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-a-a-gradient-alveolar-arterial-gradient-aag\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>)) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal lung examination (eg, rales, rhonchi, decreased breath sounds, or increased work of breathing)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4267165349\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest radiography should be performed for all children with suspected pulmonary contusion and all significantly injured children. It is initially abnormal in 65 to 97 percent of patients with pulmonary contusion. The primary finding consists of nonanatomic areas of consolidation that are located in the region of impact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F111549\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111549 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/3-5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,8</a>]. Associated injuries such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, or, less commonly, rib fractures may also be apparent.</p><p>In some children with clinical findings of pulmonary contusion, chest radiographs can initially appear normal, particularly with relatively minor injuries. However, repeat radiographs are <strong>not</strong> warranted unless the patient's respiratory status deteriorates. If the patient remains clinically stable, it is unlikely that emerging radiographic findings would have an impact on management.</p><p>Chest computed tomography (CT) is <strong>not</strong> recommended solely for diagnosing a pulmonary contusion because, although it is more sensitive for detecting pulmonary contusions than chest radiography, it does not alter clinical management in an otherwise stable patient with normal oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. CT of the chest is <strong>only</strong> useful during primary evaluation when identification of a pulmonary contusion would affect management (ie, in anesthetic management for patients requiring emergent surgery) or when there is suspicion for associated thoracic injury that warrants CT.</p><p>Later on in the care of children with pulmonary contusion, chest CT may be helpful to distinguish contusion from other causes of consolidation seen on plain radiography, such as aspiration, atelectasis, or infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>In the acute setting, bedside ultrasound by an experienced practitioner may facilitate rapid identification of pulmonary contusion. Findings of B-lines and dynamic air bronchograms in the affected lung may indicate the presence of contusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following initial stabilization of the traumatized child, hypoxic patients suspected of pulmonary contusion should be treated as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supplemental oxygen to maintain pulse oximetry &gt;95 to 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess ventilation using blood gases (arterial or venous) or end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway support should be provided as needed to maintain oxygenation and ventilation. For children with pulmonary contusion, intubation is typically required for management of extrathoracic injuries, rather than for respiratory insufficiency as the result of the pulmonary injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As an example, in a small case-series of 26 children with pulmonary contusion, none required intubation for pulmonary contusion alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of shock, fluids should be administered carefully to avoid increasing edema in the contused lung.</p><p/><p>The ongoing management of pulmonary contusion is supportive. Patients must be carefully monitored for respiratory deterioration, although the extent of lung injury is often apparent at the initial evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Good pulmonary care, careful fluid management, and adequate analgesia reduce complications and the need for intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].

The radiographic findings of pulmonary contusion may be difficult to distinguish from those of pneumonia. Therefore, children who develop fever with worsening respiratory function should receive appropriate antibiotic coverage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-children-inpatient-treatment#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumonia in children: Inpatient treatment&quot;, section on 'Hospital-acquired pneumonia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may develop in patients who survive the initial injury.

ARDS is generally associated with a mortality rate of 40 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

This was demonstrated in one retrospective series in which children with pulmonary <span class=\"nowrap\">contusion/laceration</span> were evaluated several years after the initial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. All of the subjects had normal chest radiographs and pulmonary function, with the exception of one child who had asthma. This is in contrast to adult populations, in whom long-term respiratory dysfunction frequently occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The effect of pulmonary contusion on the outcome of children with other injuries is uncertain. As an example, evidence regarding the outcome of children with severe head injury who also had a pulmonary contusion, compared with those with no lung injury, is limited and conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-contusion-in-children/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary contusion is defined as pulmonary parenchymal damage with edema and hemorrhage in the absence of an associated pulmonary laceration.
