It typically affects young adults, and, although any organ may be affected, the disorder commonly presents with one or more of the following three abnormalities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral hilar adenopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary infiltrates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eye lesions</p><p/><p>Musculoskeletal disease is a less common problem. However, joint manifestations may be clinically significant in patients with acute disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Overall, 4 to 38 percent of patients with sarcoidosis have one or more musculoskeletal manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The bone, muscle, and vascular manifestations of sarcoidosis other than arthritis will be reviewed here. Sarcoid arthropathy, an overview of the clinical manifestations of pulmonary sarcoid, and the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sarcoid-arthropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sarcoid arthropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and pathogenesis of sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MYOPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is estimated that skeletal muscle is involved in 50 to 80 percent of individuals with sarcoidosis but is rarely (0.5 to 2.5 percent) symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Symptoms may result from muscle disease involving the diaphragm, extraocular muscles, and other muscle groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/3,6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6-10</a>]. Sarcoidosis should, therefore, be considered in patients presenting with unexplained muscle weakness, pain, or nodular swelling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-muscle-weakness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with muscle weakness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Three clinical patterns of myopathy have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common form is the insidious onset of proximal muscle weakness with normal or elevated serum levels of muscle enzymes. This myopathy responds poorly to corticosteroids. It should be appreciated, however, that steroid therapy can induce a similar proximal myopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An acute myopathy, observed most commonly in women, is associated with elevated muscle enzymes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The least frequent pattern is a nodular myopathy, which can present as single or multiple painful nodules. In one case, the large lesion resembled a tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>In one series of 11 patients with sarcoidosis with chronically progressive, generalized myopathy (confirmed with muscle biopsy) and diffuse involvement of all four extremities and trunk, only two patients had muscular pain and only six had elevated serum creatine kinase levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Muscle atrophy was a prominent finding, observed in 9 of the 11 patients, mostly in the lower extremities. The hip abductors, knee flexors, and ankle plantar flexors were most commonly involved on computed tomography (CT). The various imaging modalities (gallium, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], positron emission tomography [PET]) showed evidence of inflammatory muscle disease in only half of the patients. In this series, the therapeutic response was poor in patients with more chronic disease and the best outcomes were seen with early diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>Early respiratory failure may be an early sign of sarcoid myopathy. Respiratory failure may be caused by weakness of the intercostal muscles, diaphragm, and pharyngeal muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Findings of granulomatous myositis on muscle biopsy are quite rare. Only 12 biopsies demonstrated granulomatous inflammation in a retrospective review of the microscopic sections from 2985 skeletal muscle biopsy specimens obtained over a 12-year period at one institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Idiopathic granulomatous inflammation was more common in males; in females, it was more likely to be due to sarcoidosis.</p><p>Several patients with distal muscle involvement and granulomatous myositis suggestive of sarcoid have been reported with disease that clinically mimics inclusion body myositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Electromyography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electromyographic studies in patients with sarcoidosis and muscle weakness may reveal a myopathic pattern. In some cases, widespread myotonia can mimic the pattern observed in acid maltase disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency (Pompe disease, glycogen storage disease II, acid maltase deficiency)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies may help distinguish and diagnose the different types of myopathy. One study, for example, evaluated the relative utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT scanning, and gallium scanning in four patients with biopsy-proven lower-extremity myositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Only MRI was positive in all four individuals and could distinguish between atrophic and nodular myopathy. By comparison, gallium scanning (with increased uptake) only identified nodular lesions, and computed tomography failed to provide any additional information. Nodular myopathy produces a characteristic pattern on MRI: a star-shaped area of low-signal intensity centered within the nodule surrounded by areas of high intensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This finding may help direct the location of a muscle biopsy, thereby increasing the yield. It is important to be aware that the central hypointense area persists after steroid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scans can identify active sarcoid lymph nodes in the hilum and myocardium; findings include a patchy pick-up in the skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], which is referred to as the &ldquo;tiger man&rdquo; sign, similar to the &ldquo;leopard man&rdquo; sign described on gallium-67 scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. PET scans can be helpful in identifying asymptomatic sarcoid muscle disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsy of affected muscle in patients with sarcoid myopathy reveals a diffuse cellular distribution with macrophages and CD4 positive T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, CD8 positive T cells are irregularly distributed within the granulomatous cellular infiltrate in early lesions and surrounding the granulomas in more mature lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Fibronectin and hyaluronidase can be demonstrated in the increased connective tissue with desmin differentiating the myogenic giant cells from Langhans giant cells. Endomysial and perivascular inflammation is present, along with areas of muscle fiber degeneration and regeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Fiber destruction in this disease is caused mainly by fiber infiltration rather than by mechanical compression or ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. On occasion, there may be evidence of a neuromyopathy with granuloma around intramuscular nerve fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Myopathy: Diagnosis and differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to the patient suspected of having sarcoid myopathy depends upon the presence or absence of a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. In the patient with undiagnosed weakness, the evaluation is similar to that of any patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of muscle disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-muscle-weakness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with muscle weakness&quot;</a>). In this setting, a sarcoid myopathy is suspected if a myopathy exists in association with additional manifestations of sarcoidosis.</p><p>A biopsy showing granulomatous myositis is highly suggestive of, but is not diagnostic of, sarcoidosis. This finding can also occur in a number of other disorders, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener&rsquo;s), polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and Crohn's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Associated signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis should, therefore, be present before a definite diagnosis can be established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Open surgical muscle biopsy has typically been used to assess muscle disease in patients with suspected sarcoid myopathy. Needle biopsy techniques have been used in a few patients with nodular disease; cytologic examination of specimens obtained by fine-needle aspiration may provide diagnostically useful material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Although fine-needle aspiration has the advantage of being minimally invasive, the sensitivity and specificity of this approach for patients with nodular myopathy are uncertain. However, in the setting of previously diagnosed sarcoidosis and suggestive MRI features (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above), cytologic evidence for granulomatous inflammation and an absence of both neoplasia and pathogenic infectious agents may allow a diagnosis of sarcoid myopathy to be made without open or cutting needle muscle biopsy. However, false negatives may result, in part because of patchy muscle involvement in sarcoid myopathy.</p><p>Among patients already diagnosed with sarcoidosis, the development of a myopathy is most commonly suspected among those with the insidious development of progressive proximal weakness. Acute presentations may also occur. Abnormal laboratory findings, such as elevated muscle enzymes, specific findings on MRI, and biopsy evidence of granulomatous infiltration further support the diagnosis. Reduced walking capacity and dyspnea may be caused by impaired inspiratory muscle strength, which can only be reliably detected by non-volitional tests of inspiratory muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Sarcoid myopathy: Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids may be used to treat symptomatic patients, assuming that the myopathy is not thought to be glucocorticoid-induced. This suggested approach is based upon clinical experience, as there have been no placebo-controlled studies of glucocorticoids for sarcoid myopathy. Standard doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> used for other forms of inflammatory myopathies are administered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For a patient with one or a few painful nodular sarcoid muscle lesions, combined therapy consisting of the intralesional injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a>, rest, and a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent may also be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">BONE INVOLVEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sarcoidosis of bone occurs in approximately 5 percent of patients (range of 1 to 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Although bony involvement may be the earliest manifestation of sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], it is usually accompanied by infiltrative skin lesions. When present, the presence of bone lesions generally implies a more chronic and severe disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. Almost one-half of affected patients are asymptomatic. Osteoporosis and osteopenia are also noted in patients with sarcoidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal bone lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proximal and middle phalanges are most frequently involved; however, the skull, vertebrae, ribs, maxilla, and nasal bones also may be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Dactylitis, a sausage-like swelling of a digit, as seen in seronegative spondyloarthropathy and gout, may occur with or without phalangeal bone involvement in patients with sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Cystic bone lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bony lesions are usually cystic; sclerotic lesions are rarely noted (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Sclerotic lesions'</a> below). Multiple small cystic lesions sometimes result in a &ldquo;lacy pattern,&rdquo; which is a typical lesion seen in sarcoid bone disease. These changes, most often seen in the head of the proximal or middle phalanx of the hands, are typically detected by plain film radiography, but, in some cases, lesions may only be seen on magnetic resonance images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

These lesions appear to occur exclusively in middle-aged black patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The onset of sclerotic sarcoid bone lesions is insidious and may precede other manifestations of the disease. A bone scan, which is positive, is nonspecific.</p><p>Sarcoidosis of the long bones may resemble Paget disease since both disorders are associated with increased uptake on bone scans and with lytic and sclerotic lesions on radiography.

The disease most commonly affects the lower dorsal and upper lumbar vertebrae, but the cervical spine including the atlantoaxial (C1-C2) joint may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

Granulomatous inflammation prolongs T1 and T2 relaxation times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. As a result, MRI may demonstrate single or multiple focal lesions that are hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2; lesions typically enhance with contrast administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>A biopsy may be necessary to exclude infection if the disc and spine are concurrently involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Both EOS and Blau syndrome are specifically caused by NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing gene) mutations, presenting during the first months or first years of life (usually appearing before age four), with disease characterized clinically by rash, iritis, and arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p>In some patients, large vessel involvement may resemble Takayasu arteritis. The total number of cases reported of sarcoidosis and Takayasu-like aortitis is very small and limited to case reports, but the rarity of these two syndromes suggest that the number of cases is too high for it to be mere coincidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Moreover, in most cases sarcoidosis preceded the aortitis by several years, suggesting a common basis. A review of 60 cases of Takayasu arteritis found two cases of sarcoidosis associated with aortitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The ages of reported cases of sarcoidosis with features of Takayasu-like aortitis ranged from 10 to 50 years of age, and most patients had good outcomes when they were treated with glucocorticoids.

Both are granulomatous diseases, and they have several common manifestations, such as inflammatory orbital disease, scleritis, rhinosinusitis, midline necrotizing nasal lesions, and upper and lower respiratory tract involvement. However, the most common presentation, which can be cause confusion between the two syndromes clinically, is the occurrence of pulmonary parenchymal lesions, including pulmonary nodularities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/67-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-71</a>].</p><p>Some case reports of sequential development of sarcoidosis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis suggest the possibility of a similar etiopathogenesis of these two syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations/abstract/72-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-75</a>].</p><p>It is important to differentiate between the two entities due to treatment and prognostic implications.

The differential diagnosis includes glucocorticoid-induced and other drug-induced myopathies, and, in patients with a muscle biopsy that reveals multiple noncaseating granulomas, other granulomatous diseases must also be considered. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Myopathy: Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest glucocorticoid treatment for patients with symptomatic acute or chronic myopathy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

We recommend bone biopsy to evaluate sclerotic bone lesions since these are rarely seen in sarcoidosis, and other causes of <span class=\"nowrap\">sclerotic/blastic</span> bone lesions, such as metastatic cancer, should be excluded.
