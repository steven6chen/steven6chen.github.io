It provides a nonsurgical option for pregnancy prevention that is as effective as surgical sterilization. There are two main types of intrauterine devices (IUDs) available in the United States, copper-containing or levonorgestrel-releasing (LNg). </p><p>Several terms are used to describe IUDs, including IUD and intrauterine contraception; the hormonal IUD or progestin-containing device is also referred to as an intrauterine system. We use the term IUD for all types of intrauterine devices. This topic will discuss IUD selection and use in specific populations. Issues related to IUD types, insertion, removal, side effects, and complications are discussed separately.

Older observational studies reported an increased risk of PID among IUD users, especially within the first 30 days after insertion, but the studies were flawed because of uncertainty of PID diagnosis, inappropriate control groups, bias, and confounding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. When compared with the risk of PID in women without IUDs, other reports also concluded that the risk of PID was the same or lower for IUD users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. In two trials, the reported risk of PID was 2 per 1867 patients (approximately 0.01 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and &le;1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Viral infection</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</strong> &ndash; Concerns have been raised about the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) infections in IUD users.

Both LNg and copper IUDs appear to decrease HIV target cell populations in the female genital tract and may therefore decrease the risk of HIV acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Human papilloma virus (HPV)</strong> &ndash; IUDs do not increase the risk of HPV infection and are associated with a reduced risk of developing cervical cancer. A prospective cohort study of nearly 680 women and girls (ages 13 to 22) reported no difference in HPV acquisition or clearance among those with or without an IUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This study controlled for potential behavioral confounders such as age at first intercourse, diagnosis of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HPV vaccination status, condom use, new sexual partner, use of combined hormonal contraception, smoking, and pregnancy. A different observational study that compared current IUD users with ever-users also reported no difference in the rates of HPV infection as well as no differences in rates of Papanicolaou (Pap) test progression and cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Women using no contraception have a 10-fold higher risk of ectopic pregnancy than IUD users (3.25 to 5.25 per 1000 woman-years versus 0 to 0.5 per 1000 woman-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. If pregnancy occurs, however, IUD users are at higher risk of the pregnancy being ectopic than women not using IUDs (1 in 2 pregnancies for an LNg IUD user, 1 in 16 pregnancies for a copper IUD user, and 1 in 50 pregnancies for women not using an IUD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

A case-control study of 1895 nulligravid women with tubal infertility reported that women with infertility due to tubal occlusion were no more likely to have previously used a copper IUD than women with infertility due to other factors or fertile controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Further, a trial of 209 women reported pregnancy rates in women under age 30 at one year after IUD removal that were similar to pregnancy rates in women not using any contraceptive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In women who desired pregnancy after IUD use, clinical trials reported conception rates one year after device removal of approximately 80 percent, which is comparable to women who have not used a contraceptive device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3897373167\"><span class=\"h1\">IUD SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who desire and are eligible for an IUD must decide between copper and LNg-releasing IUDs. To help a woman select a device, we ask her about her preference for cyclic bleeding, lighter periods, or amenorrhea and her tolerance of unscheduled bleeding. As most women can safely use either IUD, understanding preferences around bleeding patterns helps select an IUD that meets the patient's expectations and causes the fewest bothersome side effects.

It is not known if the 19.5 or 13.5 mg LNg IUDs have a similar effect.</p><p/><p>In addition, we use the woman's prior contraceptive history to help her with IUD selection. As an example, women who report a history of progestin-related side effects may benefit from the copper IUD whereas women with no prior hormonal side effects may prefer the LNg IUDs if they desire lighter bleeding patterns. </p><p>Both copper and LNg IUDs are among the most effective methods of reversible contraception (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>); however, the 52 mg LNg IUD is more effective at preventing pregnancy than copper IUDs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80860\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80860 \">table 1</a>). In one study, first-year failure rates were 0.07 percent for the 52 mg LNg IUD and 0.63 percent for copper IUDs (including those with less surface area of copper than the 380 mm<sup>2</sup> copper-containing IUD [abbreviated TCu380A]), and pregnancies per 100 woman-years were 6 and 52, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. One multinational study reported that the cumulative pregnancy rate at seven years was significantly lower for 52 mg LNg IUD users compared with TCu380A users: 0.5 percent compared with 2.5 percent. In this study, women were randomized to 52 mg LNg or TCu380A IUD. Of note, the discontinuation rate was significantly higher in women randomized to the LNg IUD (70.6 versus 40.8 percent at seven years) and was believed to reflect cultural preference for maintaining menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1132059475\"><span class=\"h2\">Which LNg IUD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who desire an LNg IUD can choose among the 52 mg, 19.5mg, and 13.5 mg LNg devices. While changes in bleeding patterns are common to all types of LNg IUDs, the three LNg doses cause different amenorrhea rates, which may be leveraged to improve patient satisfaction. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 52 mg LNg IUDs will cause amenorrhea in 20 to 40 percent of users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Although amenorrhea was a significant cause of device discontinuation in the initial clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], this side effect is now viewed as a benefit. We use the 52 mg LNg IUDs for women who desire or can tolerate amenorrhea, desire a reduction in menstrual flow (should they have periods), and reduction in dysmenorrhea. In contrast, the amenorrhea rate for the 19.5 mg and 13.5 mg LNg IUD is 12 to 20 percent and 6 to 12 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

We take the following approach to determine which women are good candidates for IUDs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First we ask if the woman is considering pregnancy in the next one to two years. If she is, an IUD may not be cost-effective. Short-acting reversible contraceptives such as pills, ring, or patch may be less expensive when used for less than two years (the benefit point will vary based on the cost to the patient of the different products). Yet the typical-use effectiveness of pills, especially among adolescents and young women, is low, which may make the use of an effective contraceptive more important than the one-year cost of the contraceptive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/35,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38,39</a>].

None of the IUD types contain estrogen and can be used by women with contraindications to estrogen, such as women with a history of thromboembolic events. In contrast, women who may benefit from estrogen-containing contraceptives are directed to these methods instead of the IUD or contraceptive implants. (See <a href=\"#H8681248\" class=\"local\">'When to consider an estrogen-progestin contraceptive instead of an IUD'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lastly, we consider the woman's other medical issues that may be treated by the noncontraceptive benefits of the different methods. For example, symptoms of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and endometriosis-related pain and endometrial hyperplasia do not improve with the copper IUDs. Women with these issues will likely benefit from a LNg IUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer#H269850350\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient following treatment for breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Contraception after breast cancer'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women who do not have a history of breast cancer, the data regarding the risk of developing breast cancer with LNg IUD use are conflicting. A 2017 registry study of over 1.8 million Danish women found an increased risk of breast cancer among women who had used the LNg IUD with a relative risk of 1.21 (95% CI, 1.11-1.33) compared with women who had never used hormonal contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, the study was unable to control for several known confounders for breast cancer. In contrast, a 2011 retrospective study comparing over 5000 Finnish and German women with breast cancer who had used an LNg IUD with over 20,000 control women reported no increased risk of breast cancer with LNg IUD use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

For example, use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives can lead to improvements in acne and hirsutism and maintain bone mineral density in women at risk of osteopenia. For these women, the noncontraceptive benefits of the estrogen-progestin methods may be the major factor in contraceptive choice.</p><p>Traditionally, women with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and endometriosis-related pain and women at risk for endometrial hyperplasia have been treated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. Newer data suggest that the progestin-releasing IUDs and implants may also treat these problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. The LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5</span> device is FDA approved for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, comparative studies have not been done, and therefore the optimal treatment is not known. Women with these issues can be counseled that all hormonal methods are reasonable choices for treating these problems.</p><p>Lastly, estrogen-progestin contraceptive use has been associated with reductions in ovarian and colon cancer. It is unknown if the IUDs have similar effects. One study of LNg IUD users found a reduction in risk of ovarian cancer (standardized infection ratio 0.60; 95% CI 0.45-0.76) compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Women at risk for ovarian and colon cancers may prioritize cancer reduction over the benefits from the IUDs and therefore prefer estrogen-progestin contraceptives.

Compared with contraceptive implants, IUDs have less unscheduled bleeding, fewer systemic hormonal side effects, and longer duration of action compared with the progestin-releasing implants. However, the implants are excellent options for women who do not want to or cannot use an IUD, as implants are more effective at preventing pregnancy than short-acting reversible methods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>).

While unscheduled bleeding may occur with IUD use, it is less common and generally improves with duration of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/24-27,44,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27,44,61</a>].

For women who tolerate the possibility of either amenorrhea or unscheduled bleeding but do not want an IUD, we recommend contraceptive implants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hormone level</strong> &ndash; The contraceptive implants have higher systemic progestin levels, which may cause progestin-related side effects such as emotional lability, weight gain, acne, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etonogestrel contraceptive implant&quot;, section on 'Side effects and adverse events'</a>). While the main progestin effect of the LNg IUDs is at the level of the endometrium, serum LNg levels are detectable, although they decrease with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/24-26,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26,63</a>]. Because there is wide variation in the systemic progestin level in women using LNg IUDs, some women may have progestin-related side effects similar to the contraceptive implant.

Although some IUDs contain metal (copper IUDs, the LNg 19.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/5</span> and13.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/3</span> IUDs have a silver ring), these IUDs do not move or significantly increase local temperature during MRI utilized for medical diagnosis (magnetic fields &le;3.0 Tesla units) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/24-27,64,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27,64,87</a>]. Users of copper and LNg 19.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/5</span> and 13.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/3</span> IUDs should inform the radiologist of the presence of the IUD at the time of MRI since this could affect the type of sequences utilized, the length of time of the study, and the artifacts that might occur. Specifically, the TCu380A package insert notes that magnetic fields of 1.5 Tesla are acceptable but the device has also been studied and found safe at 3.0 Tesla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

However, because the 52 mg LNg IUDs cause amenorrhea in many women, it may be difficult to determine whether menopause has occurred in the absence of other menopausal symptoms. Therefore, in 52 mg LNg IUD users with a history of more than 12 months amenorrhea, we suggest removal of the device no earlier than age 51 to 52 years since the average age of menopause is 51.3 years. Checking a follicle-stimulating hormone level can help guide decisions about whether to remove the LNg IUD or leave it in place. However, women should be counseled that they may have return to menses if they are not yet postmenopausal.

However, none of these studies measured the prevalence or incidence of symptomatic BV.
