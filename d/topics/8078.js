Chronic daily headache types with individual headaches of long duration (ie, four hours or more) include chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, medication overuse headache, hemicrania continua, and new daily persistent headache.</p><p>This topic will discuss hemicrania continua, a unilateral headache that is continuous in nature. Other types of chronic daily headache are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-daily-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic daily headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H588294959\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The posterior hypothalamus and dorsal rostral pons play a role in the physiology of HC. A controlled positron emission tomography (PET) study of seven patients with HC showed significant activation of the contralateral posterior hypothalamus and ipsilateral rostral pons during baseline pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This activation was blocked by administration of intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>.</p><p>It is hypothesized that the presence of autonomic nervous system symptoms in HC is due, at least in part, to hypothalamic activation with secondary disinhibition of the trigeminal-autonomic reflex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A similar mechanism may be implicated in cluster headache and the SUNCT and SUNA headache syndromes. The exact role of the dorsal rostral pons in HC is unclear, but this region is also activated in migraine, and may play a role in the inhibition of nociceptive traffic along the trigeminovascular system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;hemicrania continua&quot; was coined in 1984 when the first cases were described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The true frequency of hemicrania continua (HC) in the general population is unknown, and only a few hundred cases have been published in the literature. However, one headache center identified 34 new cases of HC in three years, suggesting the disorder is more common than previously considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>HC tends to have onset in the third decade of life, but with a range from the first to seventh decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is more common in women than men, with an estimated female to male ratio of 2:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the name implies, HC is a unilateral headache that is continuous in nature, at least for the unremitting form. Additional common features of HC include cranial autonomic symptoms, a sense of restlessness or agitation during exacerbations, and responsiveness to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>.</p><p>Most patients with hemicrania continua have unremitting pain, but up to 20 percent have pain-free periods that can last for one day to several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Pain is most commonly located anteriorly in the orbit, frontal regions, and temporal regions, but pain in the occiput is not rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Involvement of other regions of the head and neck has also been described. Although pain is continuous, it fluctuates in severity with superimposed attacks of more severe pain. Pain exacerbations last from minutes to several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Pain intensity ranges from mild to severe, but the pain of HC is not as excruciatingly severe as the pain of cluster headache.</p><p>During episodes of superimposed severe pain, there is usually evidence of cranial autonomic activation, although some patients with HC do not report cranial autonomic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. The most common cranial autonomic features, in approximate order of frequency, are the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lacrimation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal congestion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conjunctival injection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ptosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Forehead/facial</span> flushing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhinorrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Forehead/facial</span> sweating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyelid edema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aural fullness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aural swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mydriasis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial edema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dripping sensation at the back of the throat</p><p/><p>Eye itching or a sense of ocular discomfort, as if there is something in the eye (termed the false foreign body sensation), is often reported by patients with HC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/6,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,10</a>]. The autonomic features of HC are generally less prominent than those seen with the other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (eg, cluster headache and paroxysmal hemicrania). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cluster headache: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxysmal-hemicrania-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paroxysmal hemicrania: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although mild migrainous features are occasionally present with HC, they are most often absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Less common clinical features that have been attributed to HC include a preceding aura, transition from episodic headaches (hemicrania episodica) to HC, side-alternating attacks, bilateral pain, and evolution from cluster headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/5,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,13</a>]. Whether these are truly features of HC as opposed to similar headache disorders remains to be seen.</p><p>Superimposed jabs and jolts (stabbing headache) occur frequently in patients with HC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, some patients with HC also have primary stabbing headache and would be diagnosed with both headache types.</p><p>Primary stabbing headache refers to brief, sharp, or jabbing pain in the head that occurs either as a single episode or in brief repeated volleys. The pain is usually over the ophthalmic trigeminal distribution while the face is generally spared. The pain usually lasts a fraction of a second, but can persist for up to one minute and recurs at irregular intervals (hours to days). The attacks commonly subside with the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-stabbing-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary stabbing headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Absolute response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> therapy is required for the diagnosis of HC. This is discussed in greater detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of HC is dependent upon the clinical features of the headache and the response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>. Diagnostic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62652\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62652 \">table 1</a>), according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition beta (ICHD-3 beta), are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A.

Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis</p><p/><p>The ICHD-3 beta classification includes two subtypes of HC, a remitting form and an unremitting form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The remitting subtype of HC is characterized by pain that is not continuous but is interrupted by remission periods of one or more days without treatment. The unremitting subtype of HC is characterized by continuous pain for at least one year without remission periods of one day or more.</p><p>Despite the definition of HC, some patients with the clinical phenotype of HC do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>]. A retrospective report from a tertiary headache center identified 165 patients seen from 1998 to 2007 with a putative diagnosis of HC who then had an adequate trial of indomethacin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. An absolute response to indomethacin was observed in only 43 patients (26 percent). Furthermore, no predictors for indomethacin response were identified. This included the presence of autonomic symptoms, which were present in 57 percent of indomethacin responsive and 61 percent of indomethacin nonresponsive patients.</p><p>The lack of predictors for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> response led the investigators to suggest that all patients with continuous side-locked primary headaches receive an indomethacin trial (in the absence of contraindications to indomethacin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the strength of this finding and recommendation is limited by the retrospective study design and sample size.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic indomethacin trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As currently defined, the diagnosis of HC requires complete responsiveness to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Either oral or parenteral indomethacin (where available) can be used to confirm the diagnosis of HC.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> test can be used for the diagnosis of HC. Although there are variations in recommended titration schedules and dosages, we suggest a nine day trial of oral indomethacin. During the nine day trial, patients increase the indomethacin dose every three days (up to a maximum total daily dose of 225 mg) unless they have resolution of headache, in which case they continue at the effective dose. The starting dose is indomethacin 75 mg to 100 mg daily (given in three divided doses) for three days; the dose can then be increased if necessary to a total daily dose of 150 mg for three days, followed if necessary by a total daily dose of 200 mg to 225 mg daily (given in at least three divided doses per day) for three days. Completion of the test without headache resolution is considered a failed trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> given intramuscularly (the &quot;indotest&quot;) has been used in clinical research as a standardized diagnostic test of HC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The indotest can also be applied in clinical practice for patient diagnosis. However, parenteral indomethacin for this purpose is <strong>not</strong> available in the United States. The test involves administration of intramuscular (IM) indomethacin (50 mg to 200 mg) to a patient who otherwise meets the clinical criteria for HC; the high end of this dose range comes from the ICHD-3 beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In an open-label study of the indotest that included 12 patients with HC, administration of indomethacin 50 mg IM resulted in pain resolution after a mean interval from injection of 73 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This beneficial effect endured for a mean of 13 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemicrania-continua/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In four patients treated with indomethacin 100 mg IM, resolution of pain was noted after a mean of 61 minutes and the benefit endured for a mean of 13 hours. The indotest is also used for the diagnosis of paroxysmal hemicrania, another indomethacin-responsive primary headache disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxysmal-hemicrania-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paroxysmal hemicrania: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest performing a brain MRI scan for all patients with suspected HC to exclude a structural brain lesion, particularly one involving the pituitary fossa. Even cases fitting all criteria for HC, including a complete response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>, can have a secondary etiology.
