Invasive coronary angiography is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for the diagnosis of CHD involving the epicardial coronary vessels, but it is limited by its invasive nature, attendant risks, inability to assess the microcirculation, and cost. Invasive angiography is therefore indicated as the first diagnostic test for CHD only in select, high-risk patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), which can noninvasively image the epicardial coronary vessels, overcomes some of the risk associated with invasive angiography, but CTCA also has its own limitations (eg, inability to assess the microcirculation, artifact). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive coronary imaging with cardiac computed tomography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain or suspected CHD usually relies upon non-invasive testing. Several tests are available clinically that vary in accuracy, availability, and cost. The optimal testing strategy, including the possible use of more than one test, differs according to the patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

Because pre-test probability of disease influences post-test likelihood of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50189 \">figure 2B</a>), we highly recommend that clinical assessment of pretest probability, based upon data from large studies, be made prior to testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F112717\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112717 \">table 1</a>). This estimate of pretest probability of CHD can then be used to determine the need for and the optimal initial diagnostic approach to testing in the patient with known or suspected CHD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H622870625\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimating pretest probability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies with varying methodologies have contributed to how the pretest probability of CHD is estimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS), 1465 men and 580 women with complaints of chest pain underwent treadmill exercise testing and cardiac catheterization and were categorized into three groups based on chest pain symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Definite or classic angina &ndash; Substernal chest discomfort characterized by all of the following characteristics: a typical quality and duration, provocation by exertion or emotional stress, and relief by rest or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Probable or atypical angina &ndash; Chest pain with two of the three above characteristics</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonanginal or nonischemic chest pain &ndash; Chest pain with one or none of the above characteristics </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The pretest probability of CHD varied between 5 and 89 percent based upon gender and chest pain characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50121\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50121 \">figure 1</a>). Within each of these subgroups, the frequency of CHD increased with age, while women with the same symptoms were less likely to have CHD than men of the same age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F112717\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112717 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The higher false-positive rate on exercise ECG testing in women compared with men can be largely explained by the lower prevalence of CHD in women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50121\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50121 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of nearly 400,000 patients from the American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data Registry who underwent coronary angiography, male gender, older age, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia were independent predictors of the likelihood of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Elective noninvasive testing (some form of stress testing in most cases) was performed prior to angiography in 84 percent of patients, and patients with an abnormal noninvasive test result were significantly more likely to have obstructive CHD (41 versus 35 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multi-center registry of over 14,000 patients with suspected CHD who underwent CT coronary angiography, patient age, sex, and symptom type were independent predictors of the probability of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The overall prevalence of CHD was lower in this cohort of patients who did not undergo invasive coronary angiography than in earlier studies that required referral to cardiac catheterization to document anatomic CHD.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H622871287\"><span class=\"h2\">Using the pretest probability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interpretation of the stress test result (as with any diagnostic test) is strongly influenced by the pre-test probability of disease (ie, prevalence). The probability of disease in a patient with a positive test result (positive predictive value), and probability of no disease in a patient with a negative test result (negative predictive value), depends directly on the pretest probability of disease. Major differences between studies in the apparent accuracy of noninvasive testing are explained, at least in part, by this factor.</p><p>Stress testing is most useful for the diagnosis of CHD in patients with an <strong>intermediate</strong> pretest probability (variably defined as between 25 and 75 percent or between 10 and 90 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F112717\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112717 \">table 1</a>). Positive tests in these patients are more likely to be true positives due to the predictive accuracy of the test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Stress testing is less useful for the diagnosis of CHD in patients with either a high or a low pretest probability. Asymptomatic non-diabetic patients have a low pretest probability of significant CHD, and generally should not be screened by use of stress testing. In asymptomatic patients, the risk of developing symptomatic CHD over the next 10 years can be estimated using one of many validated risk scores. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for coronary heart disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for coronary heart disease in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In special situations, such as those who have high-risk occupations (eg, airline pilots, bus drivers), asymptomatic patients may be considered for stress testing. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Summary and recommendations'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H622871464\"><span class=\"h2\">Posttest probability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pretest probability, in conjunction with the sensitivity and specificity of the test, can also be used to determine the posttest probability of CHD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81630%7ECARD%2F50189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81630 graphicRef50189 \">figure 2A-B</a>). </p><p>Among patients with a very high pretest probability, a positive stress test is highly predictive of CHD, but a negative stress test does not exclude CHD. Conversely, among patients with a very low pretest probability, a positive stress test is likely to be a false-positive result, while a negative stress test is highly predictive of the absence of CHD.</p><p>Once the decision to perform a stress test has been made, the choice of the optimal test will depend upon clinical information. The ability to exercise adequately and a normal resting ECG are the main considerations for performing an exercise ECG without imaging. Imaging options have different advantages and disadvantages in different patient groups. Local expertise and availability may also affect the choice of imaging modality for stress testing. This is also discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H974620024\"><span class=\"h2\">Test accuracy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in whom all of the tests can be performed, accuracy, radiation exposure, local expertise in performance and interpretation of the test, and cost are all important factors in choosing a test. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H974620051\"><span class=\"h3\">Sensitivity and specificity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The accuracy of noninvasive tests for CHD is determined by their sensitivity and specificity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50121\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50121 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glossary-of-common-biostatistical-and-epidemiological-terms#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glossary of common biostatistical and epidemiological terms&quot;, section on 'Measures of diagnostic test performance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensitivity reflects a test's ability to &quot;rule out&quot; a given disease if the test is negative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specificity reflects a test's ability to &quot;rule in&quot; a given disease if the test is positive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Predictive accuracy is the percentage of test responses (both positive and negative) that are true; this measure depends upon both test characteristics and disease prevalence in the tested population.</p><p/><p>The sensitivity of the noninvasive tests for diagnosing CHD depends upon the population studied, the definition of coronary disease used (&ge;70 and &ge;50 percent diameter stenosis are common definitions), and the extent of coronary disease. There are also procedure-specific factors. With exercise ECG testing, for example, test performance can be affected by exercise end points, the number of ECG leads monitored, and most importantly by the ECG criteria used for a positive test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80746\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80746 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise ECG testing: Performing the test and interpreting the ECG results&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of a given test depend upon the definition of a positive result. As an example, if ST segment depression with exercise is used as the test end point, 1 mm of ST segment depression is more sensitive but less specific than 2 mm of ST segment depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59283\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59283 \">table 3</a>). In general, the application of more stringent criteria for a positive result decreases sensitivity and increases specificity, while the application of less stringent criteria increases sensitivity and decreases specificity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2174060403\"><span class=\"h3\">Epicardial disease versus microcirculatory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For decades, CHD was diagnosed by identifying a significant stenosis in an epicardial coronary artery, and it was felt that patients with angina but no obstructive epicardial CHD must have a non-cardiac etiology for their symptoms. This approach also affected the sensitivity and specificity of various diagnostic tests, with epicardial CHD seen (or not seen) on coronary angiography used as the gold standard. However, functional changes at the site of epicardial vessels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> at the microcirculatory level can trigger myocardial ischemia, resulting in symptoms, wall motion abnormalities on stress echocardiography, and perfusion defects on rMPI, even in the absence of severely obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-syndrome-x-angina-pectoris-with-normal-coronary-arteries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac syndrome X: Angina pectoris with normal coronary arteries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2453326348\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-test referral (verification) bias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of stress testing determine sensitivity and specificity used invasive coronary angiography as the gold standard. Because patients are generally referred for angiography due to abnormal test results, this leads to artificially increased sensitivity and decreased specificity. This poses challenges in determining the true accuracy of stress testing for the diagnosis of CHD. The few studies that have corrected for verification bias then reported lower sensitivity and higher specificity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H974620132\"><span class=\"h3\">Challenges in women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While women present some diagnostic challenges for identifying ischemia related to obstructive CHD, the choice of diagnostic test is rarely made based on gender but rather on the clinical scenario. However, women are less likely to present with (or report during treadmill testing) typical angina and false positive test results during exercise ECG testing are more common in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The diagnostic value of the exercise ECG testing alone in women is limited by a lower specificity of ST segment changes compared with men and a lower sensitivity for diagnosing ischemia compared with stress imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Some of the important causes of this lower predictive accuracy in women are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower prevalence of coronary disease than in men of the same age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher prevalence of nonobstructive CAD and microvascular disease which, while not associated with obstructive disease on angiography, can cause symptoms and are associated with future cardiac events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A modestly higher incidence of false-positive ST segment depression during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17</a>]. </p><p/><p>The optimal diagnostic strategy, from a standpoint of both accuracy and cost effectiveness, is not yet known in women with suspected CHD. The WOMEN trial randomized 824 women with an intermediate pre-test probability of CHD to either an exercise ECG or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging. The study found that the exercise ECG strategy led to more abnormal initial tests, and thus required more follow-up testing, but had lower overall costs and equivalent clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Tests for myocardial ischemia can be further classified according to the method used to detect ischemia (ECG changes, perfusion defects, or wall motion abnormalities) and the method used to induce ischemia (exercise or pharmacologic stress). The different noninvasive tests vary in their diagnostic discrimination (sensitivity, specificity, and frequency of nondiagnostic results). The sensitivity of stress testing with imaging (SPECT 87 percent, echocardiography 86 percent) is generally higher than that of exercise ECG testing without imaging (68 percent), whereas values for specificity are similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

The information about myocardial perfusion defects increases the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CHD over clinical characteristics and exercise test results. Stress rMPI also provides measurements of left ventricular volumes and global and regional function. In addition, as with stress echocardiography, stress testing with rMPI is an option for patients who are unable to exercise to an adequate level (by substituting a vasodilator or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> as the stress agent) as well as those with resting ECG abnormalities which preclude exercise ECG testing alone. Vasodilator rMPI is typically performed for the majority of patients who are unable to adequately exercise; however, dobutamine stress rMPI is an option when vasodilator effects are likely to be attenuated (ie, recent caffeine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> use) or when vasodilators are contraindicated as dobutamine can be safely given to patients with reactive airway disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A practical advantage of rMPI is the ability to perform delayed imaging post stress.

In 2016, the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology and Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging published a joint position paper recommending the use of PET MPI as a first-line preferred test for patients with known or suspected CHD who meet appropriate criteria for a stress imaging test and are unable to complete a diagnostic-level exercise stress imaging study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Compared with the exercise ECG alone, rMPI is more costly. Stress testing with rMPI also exposes the patient to radiation, although the radiation exposure with PET MPI is lower than with SPECT MPI. In addition, interpretation of rMPI with SPECT can be affected by attenuation artifacts related to soft tissue overlying the heart (eg, sub-diaphragmatic tissues, chest wall, breasts, adipose) or extracardiac radioisotope (eg, liver or gastrointestinal uptake which may be adjacent to the heart).

In contrast to stress testing with rMPI and post-treadmill exercise stress echocardiography, dobutamine stress echocardiography allows images to be obtained at increasing levels of stress and during peak stress. Other considerations in choosing between dobutamine echocardiography and pharmacologic rMPI include feasibility (rMPI is preferred if acoustic windows are suboptimal), cost (generally higher for rMPI), concern for radiation exposure (with rMPI), local availability, and expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/3,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26</a>].

One limitation is the potential for rapid resolution of ischemia prior to image acquisition post-exercise. Additionally, a hypertensive response to exercise may be associated with a greater likelihood of a false positive exercise stress echocardiogram. Suboptimal images limit the interpretation in a small percentage of echocardiographic studies, thereby impairing the assessment of segmental and global LV systolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Suboptimal imaging during exercise stress echocardiography can also be exacerbated by respiratory motion due to heavy breathing post-exercise and patient positioning following the transition from treadmill to imaging table. Echocardiographic contrast administration during stress echocardiography can help to define the endocardial borders and identify wall motion abnormalities in patients with suboptimal acoustic windows. This is discussed in greater detail separately.
