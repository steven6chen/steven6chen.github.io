Persistent thrombotic occlusion at the site of plaque rupture results in acute myocardial infarction (MI). This topic will review the evidence that antiplatelet therapy is beneficial in patients with an acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI), one of the three types of ACS, and will provide recommendations for its use. Information regarding antiplatelet agents in non-ST elevation ACS (unstable angina or non-ST elevation MI) and the role of anticoagulant therapy in STEMI are discussed separately.

The loading dose should be given as soon as possible to any patient with a STEMI, irrespective of treatment strategy. The loading dose is 162 to 325 mg of uncoated aspirin; the first tablet should be chewed or crushed to establish a high blood level quickly. There is no evidence that higher doses are more effective and they may lead to greater gastric irritation.</p><p>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy begun during the first 24 hours after acute STEMI was initially demonstrated in the Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. ISIS-2 randomly assigned 17,187 patients in a 2-by-2 factorial design to oral aspirin (160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for 30 days), intravenous streptokinase, both agents, or neither drug. Aspirin therapy resulted in a highly-significant reduction in five-week vascular mortality (23 percent reduction), which was equivalent to that seen with streptokinase (25 percent reduction) and additive when streptokinase and aspirin were administered together (42 percent reduction). The absolute mortality reduction was 2.4 vascular deaths prevented per 100 patients treated. Aspirin therapy in ISIS-2 was also associated with significant reductions in the incidence of nonfatal reinfarction (1.0 versus 2.0 percent) and stroke (0.3 versus 0.6 percent). There was no increase in the risk of major bleeding or hemorrhagic stroke in patients receiving aspirin.</p><p>More rapid absorption occurs with nonenteric coated formulations.</p><p>We prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> at a dose of 75 to 81 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> rather than higher doses, based on the following two studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CURRENT OASIS 7 trial, in which there was no significant difference in cardiovascular outcomes, but lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, with low-dose (75 to 100 mg daily) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (compared with higher dose of 300 to 325 mg daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Since prasugrel has blocked the central binding site, the switch to clopidogrel is aimed at maintaining that inhibition and thus we believe that no loading with clopidogrel may not be necessary.</p><p>Pharmacodynamic studies have demonstrated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a> has a relatively rapid offset of action. At 24 hours after the last dose of ticagrelor, approximately 50 percent of its effect (inhibition of platelet aggregation) is lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. At a minimum, this suggests that the first dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> should be given as soon as 12 hours after the last dose of ticagrelor in order to maintain antiplatelet effect. The CAPITAL OPTI-CROSS study investigated the pharmacodynamic effects of switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel with or without a loading dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Sixty MI patients (39 with STEMI and 21 with NSTEMI) who were initially treated with ticagrelor and who then needed to be switched to clopidogrel were randomly assigned to a 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel followed by 75 mg daily or to 75 mg daily (no loading dose) starting 12 hours after the last ticagrelor dose. Although there was no difference between the two strategies in the primary outcome of P2Y<sub>12 </sub>reactivity units (a measure of platelet inhibition) at 72 hours (166 versus 184), PRUs were significantly lower in the loading dose arm at 48 hours (114 versus 166). A lower PRU is associated with greater drug effect, both in terms of efficacy and risk of bleeding.</p><p>The anti-ischemic benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a>, compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, is greatest early after an ACS while the risk of important clinical bleeding due to their more potent antiplatelet effect occurs during chronic treatment. Thus, there is a rationale to consider step down or de-escalation of antiplatelet therapy from a potent P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker to clopidogrel after some period of maintenance therapy. We do not believe there is sufficient evidence to recommend routinely switching from prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel. A role for platelet function testing (PFT) to help determine if there is a subset of patients who can be successfully switched has been hypothesized but not established. The use of PFT to determine the efficacy of clopidogrel's effect is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure#H88678260\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clopidogrel resistance and clopidogrel treatment failure&quot;, section on 'HPR and thrombotic events'</a>.)</p><p>The TROPICAL-ACS trial attempted to address the issue of whether switching from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> is a reasonable strategy in ACS patients who had undergone successful PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In this study, 2610 ACS (55 percent STEMI) patients with successful PCI and who were receiving dual antiplatelet therapy planned for 12 months were randomly assigned to prasugrel for 12 months (control group) or one week of prasugrel followed by one week of clopidogrel and then PFT-guided maintenance therapy with clopidogrel or prasugrel from day 14 after hospital discharge (guided de-escalation group). Patients on clopidogrel with high platelet reactivity with insufficient platelet inhibition were switched back to prasugrel. </p><p>In TROPICAL-ACS, the one-year, net clinical end point (cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, or bleeding grade 2 or higher according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [BARC] criteria) occurred in 7 percent of patients in the guided de-escalation group and 9 percent in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.62&ndash;1.06). This study demonstrated a similar combined risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (3 versus 3 percent) and BARC 2 or higher bleeding events (5 versus 6 percent [HR 0.82 (95% CI 0.59&ndash;1.13)]) in the de-escalation and control groups, respectively. </p><p>The investigators suggested that early de-escalation of antiplatelet treatment can be considered as an alternative approach in patients with ACS managed with PCI in whom dual antiplatelet therapy is planned for 12 months. We believe this approach should be considered only in patients for whom continued use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a> is thought to present too high a bleeding risk. We believe that the results of the study should be tempered by its relatively small size, which led to a small number of ischemic events (74) and the fact that a PFT-guided antiplatelet therapy strategy is not well accepted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4144216\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistance/nonresponse to aspirin or clopidogrel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Resistance/nonresponse</span> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, along with methods to determine in vitro platelet function following treatment with clopidogrel, are discussed separately.
