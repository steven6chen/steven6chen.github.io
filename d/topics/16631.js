The four types of hiatal hernias can be distinguished by the hernia contents and the position of the gastroesophageal junction: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type I</strong> or sliding hiatus hernia is characterized by the displacement of the gastroesophageal junction above the diaphragm. The stomach remains in its usual longitudinal alignment, and the fundus remains below the gastroesophageal junction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type II</strong> or &quot;true&quot; paraesophageal hernia results from a localized defect in the phrenoesophageal membrane where the gastric fundus serves as a lead point of herniation, while the gastroesophageal junction remains fixed to the preaortic fascia and the median arcuate ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type III</strong> or &quot;mixed&quot; paraesophageal hernias have elements of both types I and II hernias and are characterized by both the gastroesophageal junction and the fundus herniating through the hiatus. The fundus lies above the gastroesophageal junction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type IV</strong> paraesophageal hernia is associated with a large defect in the phrenoesophageal membrane and is characterized by the presence of organs other than the stomach in the hernia sac (eg, colon, spleen, pancreas, or small intestine).</p><p/><p>More than 90 percent of hiatal hernias are sliding hernias (type I); less than 10 percent are paraesophageal hernias (types II, III, or IV). Of the paraesophageal types of hiatal hernias (types II, III, and IV), approximately 90 percent are mixed paraesophageal hernias (type III).

Although there is no consensus, most would agree that the very old or debilitated patients should not undergo surgery, while younger and healthier patients with a life expectancy of &gt;10 years should consider surgery to prevent both the risk of acute gastric volvulus and potentially progressive symptoms. In a theoretical study, the mortality rate from elective repair was estimated to be 1.4 percent, while the probability of developing acute symptoms that would necessitate emergency surgery was 1.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

A hiatal hernia is best visualized endoscopically with a retroflexion maneuver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54169\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54169 \">figure 2</a>). If an organoaxial rotation (a twist along the long axis of the stomach) is present, the endoscope cannot be passed into the duodenum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83731\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83731 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Barium</a><strong> swallow</strong> &ndash; A barium swallow can provide information regarding gastric anatomy, the length of the esophagus, and the presence of organoaxial rotation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50536\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50536 \">image 1</a>). </p><p/><p>Esophageal manometry and pH analysis are not required in our practice, as these tests tend to be unreliable and difficult to perform. Other surgeons perform manometry if a fundoplication is planned, and pH study if acid reflux is the primary reason for the paraesophageal hernia repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal motility testing&quot;, section on 'Esophagus'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2986570750\"><span class=\"h1\">OPERATIVE APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paraesophageal hernias can be repaired transabdominally or transthoracically. Transabdominal repairs can be performed open or laparoscopically. </p><p>In our practice, we prefer laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair (PEHR) for most patients in both elective and emergency settings. We use the open transabdominal approach in patients who have had multiple upper abdominal surgeries in the past and reserve the transthoracic approach for patients who have failed previous open transabdominal repair(s). (See <a href=\"#H1111620760\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p>However, the three operative approaches have not been directly compared with one another in randomized trials, and the optimal operative approach to PEHR remains controversial and varies by surgeon training and preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. In an analysis of almost 40,000 repairs from 1999 to 2008 captured by the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database, 74, 17, and 9 percent were performed open transabdominally, transthoracically, and laparoscopically, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Since that time, laparoscopic repair has surpassed open transabdominal repair as the most commonly performed procedure for PEHRs. </p><p>In the same study mentioned above, transthoracic repair was associated with the longest hospital stay (7.8 days), the greatest need for mechanical ventilation (5.6 percent of patients), and the greatest risk of having a pulmonary embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Laparoscopic repair was associated with the shortest hospital stay (4.5 days) and the lowest risk of requiring mechanical ventilation postoperatively (2.3 percent of patients). It is plausible that this <strong>inpatient</strong> Medicare study may have underestimated the utilization of laparoscopic PEHR and overestimated its length of stay by failing to capture patients who discharged within 24 hours of an uncomplicated laparoscopic PEHR.</p><p>Other uncontrolled studies suggest that the mortality and morbidity rates appear lower for laparoscopic PEHR compared with other approaches. While the risk of radiographic recurrence may be higher with this approach, reoperation rates appear to be similar.

Although &quot;true&quot; shortened esophagus is rare (&lt;1 percent of patients in our practice), the failure to lengthen a shortened esophagus can lead to hernia recurrence as it produces tension on the repair. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a 3- to 4-cm intra-abdominal esophageal length cannot be obtained with esophageal mobilization alone, we perform a Collis gastroplasty to gain additional esophageal length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The Collis procedure entails the creation of a gastric tube by vertically stapling the proximal stomach from the angle of His, parallel to a large bougie placed along the lesser curvature of the stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109179\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109179 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109180 \">figure 5</a>). The newly created gastric tube becomes an extension or elongation of the native esophagus (neoesophagus) such that the new esophagogastric junction can be located intra-abdominally. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The Collis procedure was originally performed via a left thoracotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] but has since been adapted for performance via thoracoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] or laparoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109179\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109179 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The laparoscopic technique is called a wedge Collis gastroplasty because a wedge of the gastric fundus needs to be resected to permit vertical placement of the stapler parallel to the lesser curvature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109180 \">figure 5</a>).

The closure of the hiatal defect is one of the most critical steps in the repair of a paraesophageal hernia. The repair must be tension free and can be performed as a primary suture repair or with mesh. We suggest against the routine use of mesh during PEHR. We use mesh selectively to close the hiatal defect as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the crural fibers are disrupted during dissection, the hernia defect is large, or the crural closure is tenuous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> under tension, we reinforce the crural closure with a biologic mesh, such as a porcine dermal matrix or a porcine small intestinal submucosa graft. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reconstructive materials used in surgery: Classification and host response&quot;, section on 'Types of reconstructive materials'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the crural fibers are intact after dissection, the hernia defect is small, and a tension-free closure can be accomplished, we close the hiatal defect primarily with three to four interrupted nonabsorbable sutures tied intracorporeally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72939\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72939 \">picture 5</a>). </p><p/><p>Both permanent and biologic meshes have been shown to be effective in reducing recurrences in separate randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/12,23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,23-27</a>]. In a 2016 meta-analysis of four randomized trials including 406 patients, compared with suture closure alone, mesh reinforcement of the crural closure reduced reoperation (2 versus 9 percent) and recurrence (16 versus 27 percent) but not complication (10 versus 10 percent) rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, only the difference in reoperation rate was statistically significant, albeit with a wide confidence interval (odds ratio [OR] 3.73, 95% CI 1.18-11.82). </p><p>In our practice, we use mesh selectively during PEHR because mesh can cause serious complications (eg, intraluminal mesh erosion, esophageal stenosis, dense fibrosis) and the need for reoperations (eg, esophagectomies, partial and total gastrectomies, esophageal stent placement). In a study that pooled 26 mesh-related complications from different surgeons, the rate of complications appeared to be independent of the type of mesh (eg, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE], biologic mesh) or the configuration of the mesh (eg, heart-shaped, keyhole, bridge, horseshoe) used, although biologic meshes were only associated with dysphagia, not erosion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16016843\"><span class=\"h2\">Fundoplication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest performing a fundoplication with PEHR. We typically perform a complete (Nissen-type) fundoplication with PEHR, except in patients with severe preoperative dysphagia, for whom we perform a partial fundoplication to minimize the potential for worsening dysphagia postoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;, section on 'Specific operative techniques'</a>.)</p><p>Both complete (Nissen) and partial fundoplications benefit patients who have preexisting symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by restoring competency to the gastroesophageal sphincter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Additional reasons to consider an antireflux procedure include reducing the risk of postoperative GERD (which can occur following extensive dissection around the crura) and obviating potential symptoms that could occur if the hernia recurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. </p><p>In a randomized trial, 40 patients underwent either simple cardiophrenicopexy (ie, suturing the cardia of the stomach to the diaphragm) or fundoplication as a part of their PEHR, and those who underwent fundoplication had significantly fewer postoperative GERD symptoms at 3 and 12 months and significantly lower rates of postoperative esophagitis (17 versus 53 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Other postoperative complications, such as dysphagia and gas bloating, did not differ between the two groups. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16016850\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior gastropexy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ideal hernia repair should result in a permanent retention of the stomach in the abdominal cavity. However, the recurrence rate following PEHR is high because of a pressure gradient resulting from the positive intra-abdominal pressure and negative intrathoracic pressure. </p><p>An anterior gastropexy (ie, fixation of the stomach to the abdominal wall) can be used to reduce the risk of gastric reherniation into the thoracic cavity. The stomach can be fixated to the abdominal wall with sutures or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes depending upon whether a primary PEHR has been performed. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anterior gastropexy with sutures</strong> &ndash; Anterior gastropexy with sutures may be performed at the end of a PEHR, although not all surgeons perform it. In a prospective series of 28 patients undergoing laparoscopic PEHR with anterior gastropexy, all patients had a normal postoperative video esophagram at 12 months and were asymptomatic, and there were no recurrences at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anterior gastropexy with PEG tubes</strong> &ndash; For patients who are too frail to undergo a formal PEHR, we perform an endoscopic hernia reduction with or without laparoscopic assistance, followed by anterior gastropexy with <strong>two</strong> PEG tubes. The placement of two PEG tubes reduces the potential risk of stomach twisting around a single PEG tube (volvulus). This procedure alleviates symptoms from a paraesophageal hernia, prevents the occurrence of gastric volvulus, and does not preclude a formal hernia repair at a later time. It can also be used for patients in an emergency setting. The technique of PEG tube placement is discussed elsewhere.

Patients who undergo open PEHR remain hospitalized until their bowel function returns, which usually occurs in approximately five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients are instructed to follow a low residue diet for two to three weeks following discharge from the hospital. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2813507348\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSTHORACIC REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transthoracic paraesophageal hernia repair (PEHR) is advocated by some authorities as an alternative to transabdominal repair in patients who are obese, have known or suspected shortened esophagus or other esophageal disease, have a very large or complex hiatal hernia (eg, type IV), or have failed previous transabdominal repairs. </p><p>The proponents of this technique argue that transthoracic PEHR is a more durable repair compared with transabdominal repair because it permits more accurate intraoperative assessment of the esophageal length, greater ease of performing an esophageal-lengthening procedure (eg, Collis gastroplasty) when indicated, greater ease of closing the hiatus without tension, and a better operative view in obese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>Given that most patients who require PEHR are older adults, we generally reserve transthoracic repair only for those who have failed or are otherwise not a candidate for transabdominal repair. (See <a href=\"#H2986570750\" class=\"local\">'Operative approaches'</a> above.) </p><p>The steps of a transthoracic PEHR include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hernia is typically exposed via a full or minithoracotomy on the left side. Any incarcerated hernia content is reduced into the abdomen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hernia sac is then dissected from the pleura and other structures in the posterior mediastinum to expose both the right and left crura. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stomach is exposed by opening the hernia sac; any organoaxial volvulus of the stomach is reduced if present. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The esophagogastric junction is then identified, and its relative position to the hiatus is assessed. With the lower esophagus adequately mobilized, if the esophagogastric junction remains at or above the hiatus, a shortened esophagus is diagnosed. In the two largest studies of transthoracic PEHR, 80 and 96 percent of the patients were found to have a shortened esophagus and underwent a Collis gastroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In patients with a shortened esophagus, an esophagus-lengthening procedure, such as the Collis gastroplasty, is required, or else the repair is likely to fail because the excess tension exerted on the esophagogastric junction is liable to pull it back into the chest. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Collis gastroplasty is the most common esophageal-lengthening procedure performed with PEHR. A large-caliber bougie is passed via the mouth into the stomach and placed along the lesser curvature. A surgical stapler is then used to create an incision from the angle of His parallel to the bougie (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109179\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109179 \">figure 4</a>). The stapling creates a tubularized proximal stomach that becomes a natural extension or elongation of the esophagus. As a result, the esophagogastric junction is extended into the abdomen for approximately 5 cm. Modifications of the Collis gastroplasty have been described for performance via a thoracoscopic or laparoscopic approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109180 \">figure 5</a>).

The wrap is often sutured to the crura with Belsey sutures to prevent slippage of the wrap. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The crural opening is then closed around the esophagus to reconstruct the new hiatus. The proponents of transthoracic repair argue that crural closure is easier with this technique compared with laparoscopic repair because the surgeon does not have to contend with the effect of pneumoperitoneum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The left thoracotomy is closed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H613238126\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT OUTCOMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22821743\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality and morbidity</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laparoscopic repair</strong> &ndash; The overall mortality and morbidity rates associated with laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair (PEHR) are low.

While most patients with a paraesophageal hernia are asymptomatic, those who have symptoms refractory to medical therapy or serious complications from a paraesophageal hernia may require surgery. (See <a href=\"#H16016779\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16017360\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency surgical repair is required for acute gastric volvulus, bleeding, obstruction, strangulation, perforation, or respiratory compromise. Elective surgical repair is required for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refractory to medical therapy, dysphagia, early satiety, postprandial chest or abdominal pain, anemia, or vomiting. Prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic patients is not advised. (See <a href=\"#H16016794\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical repair'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraesophageal hernias can be repaired transabdominally or transthoracically. Transabdominal repairs can be performed open or laparoscopically. We prefer laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair (PEHR) for most patients in both elective and emergency settings. We use the open transabdominal approach in patients who have had multiple upper abdominal surgeries in the past and reserve the transthoracic approach for patients who have failed previous open transabdominal repair(s). However, patient preference and available local expertise weigh heavily in the choice of procedures. (See <a href=\"#H2986570750\" class=\"local\">'Operative approaches'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When performed by experienced surgeons, PEHR via any of the three approaches (laparoscopic, open transabdominal, or transthoracic) can be accomplished with low mortality and morbidity. All three procedures are equally efficacious in achieving durable relief of symptoms (eg, acid reflux or dysphagia). (See <a href=\"#H613238126\" class=\"local\">'Patient outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The basic tenets of transabdominal PEHR include complete mediastinal hernia sac dissection and reduction, esophageal mobilization to relocate the esophagogastric junction intra-abdominally, stable crural closure, antireflux procedure, and intra-abdominal gastric fixation. (See <a href=\"#H16016808\" class=\"local\">'Transabdominal repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to relocate the esophagogastric junction to well within the abdomen creates tension in the PEHR, which is the leading cause of recurrences. If a 4-cm intra-abdominal esophageal length cannot be obtained with esophageal mobilization alone, we perform a Collis gastroplasty procedure to gain additional intra-abdominal esophageal length. Collis gastroplasty can be performed via thoracotomy, thoracoscopic, open transabdominal, or laparoscopic approaches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109179\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109179 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109180 \">figure 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1711149496\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal mobilization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2813507348\" class=\"local\">'Transthoracic repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <strong>against</strong> the routine use of mesh during PEHR (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Although mesh reinforcement of crural closure during PEHR may reduce recurrences, it may also potentially cause complications such as esophageal erosion or stenosis. We use <strong>biologic</strong> mesh <strong>selectively</strong> to close the hiatal defect if the crural fibers are disrupted during dissection, the hernia defect is large, or the crural closure is tenuous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> under tension. Otherwise, we close the hiatus opening primarily with sutures. (See <a href=\"#H16016829\" class=\"local\">'Closure of hiatal defect'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest performing a fundoplication with PEHR (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). A complete (Nissen-type) fundoplication is appropriate for most patients; partial fundoplication can be performed in patients with preoperative dysphagia or abnormal esophageal motility on manometry. (See <a href=\"#H16016843\" class=\"local\">'Fundoplication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who cannot tolerate a formal PEHR, we perform an endoscopic hernia reduction with or without laparoscopic assistance followed by double percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement or sutured gastropexy as an anterior gastropexy. A formal PEHR can be performed later if the patient's condition improves. (See <a href=\"#H16016850\" class=\"local\">'Anterior gastropexy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We administer antiemetics to patients in the first 24 postoperative hours to reduce the risk of postoperative emesis, which may result in disruption of the repair and early recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H16016864\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow study on the first postoperative day to assess for possible esophageal leak and early hernia recurrence and to evaluate gastric emptying and motility. (See <a href=\"#H16016864\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transthoracic PEHR is advocated by some authorities as an alternative to transabdominal repair in patients who are obese, have known or suspected shortened esophagus or other esophageal disease, have a very large or complex hiatal hernia (eg, type IV), or have failed previous transabdominal repairs. However, because of the higher morbidity associated with a thoracotomy, we generally reserve transthoracic repair only for patients who have failed or are otherwise not a candidate for transabdominal repair. (See <a href=\"#H2986570750\" class=\"local\">'Operative approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operative management of recurrent paraesophageal hernias is reserved for symptomatic patients and should only be performed by highly experienced surgeons due to its complexity.
