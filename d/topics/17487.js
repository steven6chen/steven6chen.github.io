The organisms causing TTBI can come from donor blood, donor skin, the phlebotomist's skin, or environmental contamination during production or packaging (eg, contaminated water baths used to thaw blood products) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A source for TTBI is not always identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In a report of 25 cases of red blood cell contamination, gram-negative rods were the most common source of contamination.

These organisms can survive and multiply in cold-stored bank blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Tickborne infections (eg, <em>Babesia</em>, <em>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</em>, <em>Rickettsia rickettsii</em>, Colorado tick fever virus, and tickborne encephalitis virus) can also be transmitted by transfusion of blood products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. Transfusion is associated with risk for transmission of parasitic infection in endemic countries (eg, malaria, trypanosomiasis, and leishmaniasis). The blood supply is not routinely tested for these pathogens, and donor questionnaires are not sufficient to screen out donors in the early phases of infection with these organisms.

The rate was 7.4 per million allogeneic transfusions and 1.9 per million autologous transfusions.

This was illustrated in a prospective study of 161 stem cell transplant recipients who received 3584 platelet transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The risk of TTBI was 1 in 350 pooled platelet transfusions and 1 in 2000 per individual platelet unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>One study found a higher risk of TTBI in patients receiving red blood cells for pancytopenia (odds ratio [OR] 7.3, 95% CI 1.3-41.0) or platelets for thrombocytopenia (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.2-24.1) compared with the risk for red blood cells transfused for treatment of anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The estimated incidence of TTBI is higher than estimated incidence for transfusion-transmitted HIV or hepatitis C transmission (approximately 1 in 2 million units transfused) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20325142\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood product contamination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of blood product contamination is significantly higher than the incidence of transfusion-transmitted infection. In the United States, the incidence is approximately 1 in 2000 for platelets and 1 in 30,000 for red blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/6,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,22,23</a>]. Others have reported rates of 0.2 to 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Contamination has been observed less frequently among leuko-depleted units and also with diversion of the initial component of the blood donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Skin flora are common organisms associated with contamination.</p><p>The difference in incidence between blood product contamination and transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection may be due to insufficient bacterial inoculum to cause clinical manifestations, death of the bacteria in refrigerator-stored cell components, or contamination of the blood product during the testing.</p><p>Autologous blood transfusion has been associated with risk of blood product contamination. Among 287 autologous blood transfusions in Japan, 6 percent of units tested immediately prior to transfusion were culture positive; the most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The incidence of contamination was highest with intraoperative blood salvage (33 percent). With exclusion of intraoperative blood salvage samples, the residual rate was 3 percent.</p><p>The duration of storage appears to be an important factor in blood product contamination. In one series including over 3000 random donor platelet pools, the incidence of contamination detected by Gram stain was much lower in units stored for &le;4 days than for units stored for 5 days (1.8 versus 11.9 per 10,000 units) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, among the contaminated units, the magnitude of contamination was less in those stored for &le;4 days. The storage medium used for platelet transfusion may affect the risk of TTBI. One study reported a fourfold increased incidence of TTBI with platelet concentrates stored in platelet-additive solution compared with plasma-stored platelet concentrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection (TTBI) include fever &gt;39&ordm;C (or an increase of &gt;2&ordm;C following transfusion), rigors, tachycardia (&gt;120 beats per minute or increase of 40 beats per minute following transfusion), and rise or fall in systolic blood pressure (&gt;30 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Distinguishing between TTBI and other conditions on these grounds is unreliable, however, since these manifestations can also be associated with nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, acute hemolytic reactions, allergic reactions, and other causes. In addition, TTBI can also occur in the absence of the above findings. Therefore, clinicians managing patients who become unwell during or following blood product administration must maintain a high degree of suspicion for TTBI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The median interval between completion of transfusion and appearance of symptoms is 30 minutes (range 0 to 5 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. In a report of 158 cases of suspected TTBI, the interval was shorter in cases due to gram-negative bacilli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Infection with gram-negative organisms has been associated with the greatest risk of death (odds ratio 7.5, 95% CI 1.3-64.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The variation in presentation of TTBI is due to a number of factors including the size of the bacterial inoculum, bacterial virulence, and the recipient's immune status. In one study including 41 cases of TTBI, 19 patients had minor symptoms, 16 had life-threatening severe sepsis or shock but recovered, and 6 patients died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Fever and chills were the most common symptoms. Abdominal pain, back pain, nausea, vomiting, and hypothermia were also reported.

In addition, the risk varies with the type of blood product and the underlying conditions of patient transfused. Platelet transfusions carry a higher risk of contamination because they are stored at room temperature. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of TTBI include fever, rigors, tachycardia, and rise or fall in systolic blood pressure. Distinguishing between TTBI and other conditions on these grounds is unreliable, however, since these manifestations can also be associated with nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, acute hemolytic reactions, allergic reactions, and other causes. In addition, TTBI can also occur in the absence of these findings. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of suspected TTBI, the transfusion should be stopped, the patient should be resuscitated, and blood should be collected for culture and evaluation for evidence of transfusion reaction. The blood bank and microbiology laboratory should be alerted; checks for clerical error should be performed, and the blood product bag should be sent for culture. If suspicion for TTBI is high (eg, in the setting of fever together with hypotension, shock, or respiratory failure), we suggest initiating broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>); reasonable regimens include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> plus a broad-spectrum beta-lactam or an aminoglycoside. Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on culture results or discontinued if an alternate diagnosis is made. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventive measures are outlined above. The common preventive strategies include donor-selection protocol, skin disinfection, sample diversion, leukodepletion, and detection of contamination by culture. (See <a href=\"#H1969736\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Perez P, Salmi LR, Foll&eacute;a G, et al.
