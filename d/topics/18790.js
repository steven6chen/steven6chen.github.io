Birth weight and adiposity are important because they have a major impact on neonatal morbidity and mortality, and also appear to affect early adult weight and long-term health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. As an example, low or high birth weight may affect the child's future risks of developing diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Gestational weight gain also impacts the mother, as excessive gestational weight gain increases her risk of postpartum weight retention and thus increases her risk of becoming obese or developing worsening obesity. </p><p>Given the importance of gestational weight gain and birth weight, guidelines regarding appropriate levels of weight gain in pregnancy have been promoted worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although the importance of appropriate weight gain is well established, most women gain too little or too much weight during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CHANGE IN WEIGHT RELATED TO PREGNANCY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20253963\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal weight gain during pregnancy can be attributed primarily to increases in maternal body water and fat. On average, weight gain at term is distributed as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetus: 7 to 8 pounds (3.2 to 3.6 kg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fat stores: 6 to 8 pounds (2.7 to 3.6 kg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased blood volume: 3 to 4 pounds (1.4 to 1.8 kg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased fluid volume: 2 to 3 pounds (0.9 to 1.4 kg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amniotic fluid: 2 pounds (0.9 kg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast enlargement: 1 to 3 pounds (0.45 to 1.4 kg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine hypertrophy: 2 pounds (0.9 kg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placenta: 1.5 pounds (0.7 kg)</p><p/><p>In the absence of pathological edema (eg, preeclampsia), excessive gestational weight gain is primarily related to an excessive increase in maternal adiposity. There are several biologic and genetic factors that affect fat metabolism both during and after pregnancy. For example, increased progesterone levels during pregnancy are responsible for fat accumulation during the first and second trimesters, and for fat mobilization during the third trimester. Increased leptin levels during pregnancy correlate positively with body fat content and body mass index (BMI) and appear to play a direct role in gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

In longitudinal studies, African American women had three-fold higher median gestational weight gain than Caucasian women and they were twice as likely to have postpartum weight retention &gt;4 kg at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. These relationships remained even when prepregnancy weight was normal. In contrast, Hispanic women were more likely to have inadequate gestational weight gain (based on Institute of Medicine [IOM] guidelines) when compared to their non-Hispanic counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>In addition to race and ethnicity, many other variables contribute to gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention, including marital status, age, income, education, occupation, working outside of the home, physical activity, and smoking. </p><p>Postpartum weight retention is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care#H46\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the postpartum period: Physiology, complications, and maternal care&quot;, section on 'Postpartum weight retention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3633731244\"><span class=\"h2\">Background</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 1930s, all pregnant women in the United States, irrespective of pregravid weight status, were advised to gain only 15 pounds (6.8 kg). Severe dietary restriction was a common obstetrical practice based on the belief that excessive gestational weight gain led to the development of preeclampsia and other obstetrical problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Weight gain recommendations became more liberal when studies demonstrated that dietary restriction was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight and neurologically impaired infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Therefore, in the late 1970s and 1980s, recommendations for gestational weight gain increased to 20 to 25 pounds (9 to 11 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In 1987, the Committee on Nutritional Status During Pregnancy and Lactation of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) made a detailed analysis of all published data pertaining to prepregnancy weight, weight gain during pregnancy, and pregnancy outcome and, based on this analysis, formulated recommendations for healthy gestational weight gain in 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These recommendations were an attempt to increase the likelihood of a favorable pregnancy outcome, which was defined as delivery of a term liveborn infant with a birth weight between 3000 and 4000 grams. It was assumed that increasing maternal weight gain among underweight women would lower the rate of low birth weight and its associated perinatal morbidity and mortality, without adversely affecting other obstetrical outcomes. Little was known about the relationship between weight gain, birth weight, and pregnancy outcome in the obese women. The IOM also concluded that prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80542\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80542 \">table 1</a>) was an important predictor of birth weight, independent of maternal weight gain, and should be used to guide recommendations for gestational weight gain. Thus, determining BMI became an integral part of the physical examination of pregnant women. </p><p>In the absence of definitive data, 1990 IOM guidelines recommended what the authors considered an optimum weight gain for women with a normal BMI (25 to 35 pounds [11 to 16 kg]), with lower weight gain for women beginning pregnancy at higher BMIs (with no upper limit) and higher weight gain for women beginning pregnancy at lower BMIs. The studies on which the 1990 recommendations were based were generally not of high quality; thus, more research was needed to validate or modify these guidelines. </p><p>In 2009, the IOM modified the 1990 guidelines based on findings from research performed over almost two decades following their initial recommendations. The 2009 guideline included recommendations for gestational weight gain in twin pregnancy and changes to the recommendations for obese women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75820 \">table 2</a>); the IOM also recommended that all women strive to be within the normal BMI range when they conceive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for defining weight categories were adopted in the revision, as well. There were insufficient data on which to base recommendations for weight gain in triplet and higher order multiple gestations or for the three classes of obesity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F97661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97661 \">table 3</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1230637565\"><span class=\"h2\">2009 IOM weight gain recommendations</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Singleton pregnancy</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BMI &lt;18.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (underweight) &ndash; weight gain 28 to 40 lbs (12.5 to 18.0 kg)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BMI 18.5 to 24.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (normal weight) &ndash; weight gain 25 to 35 lbs (11.5 to 16.0 kg)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BMI 25.0 to 29.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (overweight) &ndash; weight gain 15 to 25 lbs (7.0 to 11.5 kg)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BMI &ge;30.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (obese) &ndash; weight gain 11 to 20 lbs (5 to 9.0 kg)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Twin pregnancy</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BMI &lt;18.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (underweight) &ndash; no recommendation due to insufficient data</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BMI 18.5 to 24.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (normal weight) &ndash; weight gain 37 to 54 lbs (16.8 to 24.5 kg)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BMI 25.0 to 29.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (overweight) &ndash; weight gain 31 to 50 lbs (14.1 to 22.7 kg)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BMI &ge;30.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (obese) &ndash; weight gain 25 to 42 lbs (11.4 to 19.1 kg)</p><p/><p>These recommendations are for the general obstetrical population in the United States, and are independent of age, parity, smoking history, race, and ethnic background. The relationship between weight gain and pregnancy outcome has not been evaluated extensively in subpopulations of pregnant women, and further study is needed. For example, teenagers may benefit from higher weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and women with severe or class II or III obesity may benefit from lower weight gain targets than women with milder or class I obesity. &#160;</p><p>For underweight and normal weight women, the guidelines translate to about one pound (0.5 kg) weight gain per week in the second and third trimesters; for overweight and obese women, the guidelines translate to about one-half pound (0.25 kg) weight gain per week in the second and third trimesters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75820 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>If weight gain is less than one-half pound (0.25 kg) per week or more than one and a half pounds (0.7 kg) per week, clinicians are advised to evaluate the woman's eating habits and other potential etiologies of deficient or excessive weight gain (eg, smoking is strongly associated with inadequate weight gain, weight gain can be due to edema or fat accretion) and to evaluate whether fetal growth is adequate or impacted by insufficient or excessive maternal weight gain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H316418589\"><span class=\"h2\">Actual gestational weight gain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Population-based data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) showed that the percent of American women who met, exceeded, and did not achieve IOM weight gain targets in 2010 to 2011 was 32, 47, and 21 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Although women with low prepregnancy BMI can benefit from gestational weight gain above IOM recommendations because fewer newborns weighing less than 3000 grams will be born, this is not the case for women with prepregnancy BMI in the normal, overweight, or obese range. For these women, gestational weight gain above IOM recommendations does not decrease the rate of infants weighing less than 3000 grams, but does lead to higher mean birth weight, higher rate of LGA infants, and an increase in suboptimal neonatal outcomes. Thus, for these women, any birth weight benefits associated with a higher mean birth weight are offset by the increased risks of delivering a LGA infant, neonatal morbidity associated with higher mean birth weight, and maternal morbidity stemming from higher body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. </p><p>The argument against gestational weight gain above the IOM's guidelines has largely been based on studies showing that it leads to postpartum weight retention and future adult obesity, which is reaching epidemic proportions in developed countries. In its 2009 report, the IOM stated that an analysis restricted to data collected at 24 weeks postpartum or later found that more than 60 percent of women in all <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups who gained above the range recommended by IOM 1990 retained &gt;10 pounds postpartum and more than 40 percent of women who gained excessively retained &gt;20 pounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Excess gestational weight gain has also been associated with an increased risk of pregnancy-related hypertension (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>], cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], gestational diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], neonatal adiposity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>], and childhood overweight or obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4263469719\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of low gestational weight gain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As demonstrated above, the major concern of gestational weight gain below IOM recommendations is an adverse effect on birth weight, and increased risks for SGA and preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

None of the studies assessed the effect of weight loss on preterm birth rates.</p><p>A limitation of this meta-analysis is that the amount of weight loss was not considered. A small (&lt;5 kg) weight loss in class II and III obese women (body mass index [BMI] 35.0 to 39.9 and BMI &ge;40, respectively) appears to have more benefits than risks, and may not increase the risk of having a small for gestational age infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. </p><p>Weight loss may be accompanied by ketonuria.

It may be useful to explain that caloric intake does not need to increase in early pregnancy, as weekly weight gain in the first trimester should be minimal (1 to 4 pounds).

Given the high prevalence of <span class=\"nowrap\">overweight/obese</span> pregnant women and excessive weight gain in pregnancy, and the potential adverse effects of both high maternal BMI and high gestational weight gain, we believe avoidance of excessive weight gain, rather than prevention of inadequate gain, should be the main focus of weight gain counseling during prenatal care. This discussion should occur early in the woman&rsquo;s first pregnancy, as excessive weight gain in a first pregnancy is predictive of excessive weight gain in subsequent pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. As women are particularly concerned about their health and the health of their babies during pregnancy, and in frequent contact with their healthcare providers, pregnancy is an ideal time for promotion of weight control and adoption of a healthy lifestyle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have examined the effect of antenatal behavioral intervention (eg, counseling about diet, physical activity, and optimum weight gain; goal setting) for prevention of excessive weight gain during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/64-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-71</a>]. Although some of these analyses found these interventions significantly decreased gestational weight gain compared with usual care, there was no clear clinically significant reduction in maternal complications or adverse neonatal outcomes. Published intervention trials have generally been of small size and insufficient quality to allow evidence-based recommendations to be developed for clinical practice in antenatal care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. </p><p>Large well-designed randomized trials have illustrated the challenges of limiting gestational weight gain at the population level. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the LIMIT trial, over 2000 pregnant women with BMI &ge;25 were randomly assigned to usual care or a comprehensive intervention that included a combination of healthy dietary, exercise, and behavioral strategies provided by a research dietician and trained research assistants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Gestational weight gain and almost all pregnancy outcomes (eg, preterm birth, large for gestational age [LGA] infant, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes) were similar for both groups; however, the intervention group had fewer births &gt;4000 grams (15 versus 19 percent). The authors commented that a more intense lifestyle intervention, requiring more time from women and staff, would be impractical and expensive. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial (UPBEAT) trial randomized over 1500 obese pregnant women to usual care or to eight weekly sessions with a health trainer who provided support and advice about a healthy pattern of eating and physical activity, as well as strategies for overcoming barriers to behavioral change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Although the intervention group had less gestational weight gain (7.19 kg versus 7.46 kg), the primary outcomes of gestational diabetes mellitus and&nbsp;large for gestational age infants did not differ between groups.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2195184939\"><span class=\"h3\">Metformin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In studies involving women with gestational diabetes mellitus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> reduced gestational weight gain in addition to its anti-hyperglycemic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. Two placebo-controlled randomized trials tested the hypothesis that metformin administration in the second and third trimesters would reduce gestational weight gain in obese nondiabetic pregnant women and, in turn, reduce pregnancy complications associated with obesity (eg, preeclampsia, large for gestational age infant). In the Metformin in Obese Nondiabetic Pregnant Women (MOP) trial, nondiabetic women with BMI &gt;35 were administered metformin beginning with 1 g daily and increasing to a maximum dose of 3 g daily (if tolerated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. In the Effect of Metformin on Maternal and Fetal Outcomes in Obese Pregnant Women (EMPOWaR) trial, nondiabetic women with BMI &ge;30 were administered metformin beginning at 500 mg and increasing to a maximum dose of 2.5 g daily (if tolerated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>In both trials, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> use did not reduce the frequency of large for gestational age neonates or adverse neonatal outcomes, and did not affect <span class=\"nowrap\">mean/median</span> birth weight, compared with placebo. In MOP, but not EMPOWaR, metformin use reduced gestational weight gain (4.6 versus 6.3 kg) and the rate of preeclampsia (3 versus 11.3 percent). Additional studies of metformin, as well as other interventions, are being studied to assess their effects on weight gain and other relevant clinical outcomes.

Our approach is supported by several studies in which <span class=\"nowrap\">overweight/obese</span> women who gained only 6 to 14 pounds (2.7 to 6.4 kg) had similar or better neonatal outcomes as <span class=\"nowrap\">overweight/obese</span> women whose weight gain was higher and within IOM recommendations of 15 to 25 pounds (7.0 to 11.5 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy/abstract/80-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-87</a>].

High prepregnancy BMI, maternal adiposity, and excessive gestational weight gain are risk factors for delivering a large for gestational age (LGA) infant, adverse pregnancy outcome, childhood obesity, and metabolic changes associated with poor health. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiological changes related to pregnancy result in a weight gain of about 25 pounds (11 kg). In the absence of pathological edema, excessive gestational weight gain is primarily due to an excessive increase in fat stores. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Change in weight related to pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women whose gestational weight gain is within IOM guidelines are less likely to deliver infants at low or high birth weight for gestational age. Inadequate gestational weight gain reduces birthweight. Excessive gestational weight gain increases the risk for macrosomia and postpartum weight retention. Other maternal and offspring outcomes are also affected.
