Homeless women are at higher risk of having chronic illnesses, infectious diseases, substance abuse problems, mental illness, and being a victim of sexual or domestic violence than women who are not homeless [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

Persons who experience homelessness may be less likely to engage in the health care system due to challenging relationships with care providers, inconvenience, cost, and a perceived lack of compassion and discrimination on the part of the providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The homeless teenager is often the product of domestic instability <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poverty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a survey of women at emergency departments and primary care clinics, pregnant women who were homeless had higher rates of cigarette smoking, lower rates of employment, and lower achieved educational levels as compared with consistently housed counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a study that reviewed trends of homeless women in the US from 2000 to 2007, homelessness was associated with Black and Hispanic races, being unmarried, uninsured, receiving government aid, and not taking a multivitamin supplement before pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The prevalence of homelessness among women in this study was 4 percent, which is about 1 in every 26 women of reproductive age in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1158229055\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY OF HOMELESSNESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Homelessness has many causes and homeless pregnant women are a heterogeneous group. Domestic and sexual violence is the leading cause of homelessness in women, as 20 to 50 percent of all homeless women and children become homeless as a direct result of trying to escape domestic violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Women continue to be at risk of violence in homeless shelters or when living on the streets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Some shelters do not accept pregnant women out of concern of liability if the woman experiences complications or problems while in the shelter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Other factors include joblessness, inadequate social or financial support, substance abuse, mental illness, previous incarceration, loss of a home (eg, fire, eviction, building condemned or sold), and discrimination in housing because of ethnicity, number of children, receipt of welfare, or pregnancy. Pregnancy or pregnancy complications may lead to loss of employment and, in turn, loss of income to pay for housing.</p><p>For a teenager, pregnancy may be the precipitating event that leads to her voluntarily or involuntarily leaving her parents&rsquo; home. Psychosocial issues are also common in this population. A three-year study of pregnancy and motherhood in unaccompanied homeless women aged 16 to 19 years observed high rates of mental illness and substance abuse: approximately 32 percent suffered from major depressive disorder, 65 percent from a conduct disorder, and 51 percent from posttraumatic stress disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The rates of alcohol and drug abuse were 21 and 35 percent, respectively. Treating a concurrent substance use disorder is critical to providing a pathway to stable housing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9105603\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE OF PREGNANCY IN THE HOMELESS POPULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most reports suggest pregnancy is more prevalent in homeless women, but accurate data are difficult to obtain. In one study of 764 homeless women in Los Angeles, 28 percent reported being pregnant in the past year and almost 75 percent of these pregnancies were unintended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Similarly, a study in London showed that 24 percent of homeless women were pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. By comparison, about 10 percent of all reproductive aged women in the United States become pregnant each year and approximately 50 percent of these pregnancies are unintended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Unintended pregnancies are more common in homeless women because of the many barriers to contraceptive use in this population, including lack of education about, and access to, free or low cost contraceptives, lack of storage space for contraceptives, an irregular and unpredictable lifestyle, involvement in the sex trade, victimization by sexual violence, and partners unwilling to use condoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/4,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19,20</a>]. These issues were illustrated in a study of 15 homeless pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although pregnancy was sometimes the precipitating factor that caused these women to become homeless, the majority of women became pregnant while they were homeless. From their self-reports, factors that contributed to becoming pregnant included victimization, economic survival, lack of access to contraceptives, the need for closeness and intimacy, uncertain fertility, and hope for the future. For some women, their pregnancy was their only source of joy and a catalyst for them to resolve past problems and seek a better life.</p><p>A study from Montreal demonstrated that adolescents who are homeless have higher rates of pregnancy compared with their counterparts living at home: 48 versus 10 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A past history of sexual abuse was significantly associated with pregnancy among the girls in this study as well as an early initiation of injected drug use. In addition, homeless teenagers may avoid contraception because they perceive pregnancy as an opportunity to form stable bonds and restructure their lives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1158229143\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few studies have examined pregnancy outcomes in the homeless. The risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes is increased in homeless pregnant women due to poor access to health care, poor nutrition, lack of housing, substance abuse, exposure to violence, a high prevalence of infection, and medical co-morbidities; the most common complications are preterm delivery and low birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/13,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,22-25</a>].</p><p>As an example, a Canadian study found that pregnant women who were homeless or had inadequate housing had a three-fold increase in risk of preterm delivery or small for gestational age infant and a seven-fold increase in risk of birth weight &lt;2000 grams compared to women who were not homeless, after adjustment for risk factors such as maternal age, number of previous pregnancies, and smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Homeless substance abusers were at even higher risk of these outcomes. In another study, none of the homeless women had consistent prenatal care and they were not educated about, and could not differentiate between, normal and pathological signs and symptoms related to pregnancy. Others have reported that homeless women sleeping on the streets have an even greater risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes than women sleeping in shelters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10643761\"><span class=\"h1\">CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effects of homelessness extend beyond pregnancy and significantly impact health outcomes of the newborn and young child. Several studies have shown higher rates of acute and chronic health problems in homeless children compared to low-income children with homes. There is an increase in the rates of infectious, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and dermatologic diseases, as well as otitis media, diarrhea, bronchitis, scabies, lice, dental caries, asthma, and accidents and injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It is therefore important for pediatricians to provide comprehensive care at each visit, including immunizations and screening for at-risk conditions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9105611\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, homeless shelters should screen women of reproductive age for pregnancy in order to allow early identification and referral to appropriate sources of prenatal care. Some homeless women do not even know that they are pregnant because their menstrual periods have stopped or become irregular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Most seek health care from an urgent care or emergency medicine setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1170194956\"><span class=\"h2\">Barriers to receiving health care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major barriers to prenatal care are site-related factors such as distance to the prenatal care site, lack of transportation, and long wait times for appointments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Socioeconomic factors such as financial constraints and lack of insurance coverage contribute to poor compliance with visits and recommendations for drug therapy. Health care demands compete with needs for food, clothing, and shelter. Other significant limitations are lack of knowledge about where or how to acquire prenatal care and fear of how the homeless woman will be perceived or treated by health care providers. For example, women with substance abuse issues, mental illness, or undocumented resident status may fear being reported to the authorities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and women with children may fear that their children will be taken away [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, all states provide medical insurance (Medicaid) to low income pregnant women who have no medical insurance or inadequate insurance. The income threshold varies among states, but the minimum is a family income at or below 133 percent of the Federal poverty level. Women who earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid when they were not pregnant may qualify when they become pregnant and when they have a child because the income threshold is different for these groups. Pregnant women are usually given priority in determining Medicaid eligibility, and will receive qualification within two to four weeks of submitting an application.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1158229101\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal providers should identify patients who may be homeless or at risk of becoming homeless; pregnant women may be reluctant to voluntarily reveal their homelessness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. Prenatal care of homeless women should include referral for available resources, social support, and screening for conditions more prevalent in the homeless population. Prenatal care should be provided without bias or prejudice and with empathy and effort to establish rapport so that a trusting relationship can be developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The provider should be honest and let the patient know when tests for drugs and reportable diseases are being performed and when the provider is obligated to notify child protection services. Treatment regimens should be simplified whenever possible and more cost effective options offered, when available. Treatment should not be withheld due to assumptions about lack of adherence. It is helpful to be flexible in scheduling appointments.</p><p>A standard initial prenatal assessment should be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-initial-assessment#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Initial assessment&quot;, section on 'Laboratory tests'</a>.) However, for a homeless woman, the initial prenatal care visit may be the only opportunity to provide care prior to delivery; therefore, it is important to assess what information is critical and prioritize accordingly. Information should be relevant to the patient&rsquo;s circumstances and living situation, and provided in small increments.</p><p>Screening for the following problems is particularly important in homeless women since these problems are more prevalent in this population. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Domestic violence (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening&quot;</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance abuse (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Substance misuse in pregnant women&quot;, section on 'Screening for drug use'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intimate partner violence (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental illness (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=somatic-symptom-disorder-assessment-and-diagnosis#H3356131635\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Assessment'</a>)</p><p/><p>A complete physical examination is performed, with attention to establishing gestational age. The skin should be examined carefully, as skin conditions are among the most common diagnoses in clinics for the homeless. Lice, scabies and secondary bacterial complications are highly contagious problems endemic to homeless people (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states#H12137936\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Health care of homeless persons in the United States&quot;, section on 'Skin and foot problems'</a>). Dental health and visual acuity should be assessed as these needs may have been neglected.</p><p>Routine prenatal laboratory tests are obtained, as well as additional testing based on patient-specific risk factors (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-initial-assessment#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Initial assessment&quot;, section on 'Laboratory tests'</a>). For example, the rate of HIV infection among homeless youth is substantially higher than the national rate for youth; 2.3 percent versus 0.1 percent nationally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In addition to routine screening for chlamydia, syphilis, hepatitis B, and HIV, we suggest screening homeless women for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gonorrhea (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents#H1235604960\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis C (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuberculosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states#H12137978\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Health care of homeless persons in the United States&quot;, section on 'Respiratory infections'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis in pregnancy&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Illicit drugs (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-substance-use-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of substance use disorders&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Immunizations are likely to have been neglected. Immunization records should be obtained, if available, and missed immunizations should be provided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Obstetric health care providers may use the patient's pregnancy and prenatal care as an opportunity to connect her with resources for substance use, housing, and mental health care. Health care providers should be aware of local resources for the homeless and how to access them. Case management or social workers should be involved in patient care so they can provide information on shelters for women and children or affordable housing, transportation to and from appointments and the hospital, mental health and substance abuse treatment programs, food banks, clothing, child care resources, legal aid, and crisis lines. For women who do not live in shelters that provide meals, obtaining, transporting, storing, and cooking nutritious food can be a major problem. Substance abusers are prone to undernutrition and malnutrition, and women with diabetes may not have access to antihyperglycemic drugs or be able to adhere to a regular schedule of meals. Preexisting mental health issues may be exacerbated by stress and pregnancy-related mood changes. Social workers are often familiar with staff at local shelters, government agencies for housing vouchers, and other resources, which facilitates obtaining these resources for patients who need them.</p><p>Homeless women also need to be prepared for labor and delivery, postpartum issues, care of the newborn, and parenting. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9105659\"><span class=\"h2\">Labor and delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some homeless women may attempt to speed the onset of labor with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=castor-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">castor oil</a> or cocaine because of the discomforts of late pregnancy, which are particularly problematic for women living in the streets or in a shelter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Discharge planning involves the various members of the interdisciplinary team. It is important to view every patient individually; each situation should be handled on a case-by-case basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p>The initial assessment should address living situation, support system, knowledge of childcare issues, resources, and issues regarding substance abuse and mental health. Many homeless women will be reluctant to honestly share this information and worry about being judged by the hospital staff; however, many are eager and receptive to getting help. Their dignity should be respected, and their strengths and accomplishments recognized. </p><p>The decision to involve Children's Protective Services (CPS) is made after evaluating whether or not the mother is making healthy choices for her child. This assessment is typically done by a social worker rather than the health care provider. Living in a shelter may show that she has made some choices to regain the stability that her child will need. A qualitative study of women in California suggested that attaining stable housing is a primary determinant in retaining custody of one&rsquo;s children after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Many shelters provide counseling, day care, and assistance with other basic needs. This shelter may be the closest thing to a home that this mother and her child will have. If this is the case, and there are no other high-risk concerns, the usual course of action would be to assist her with resources and provide encouragement. However, if a mother plans on returning to life on the streets with her newborn, or if there are additional concerns regarding the safety and well-being of the baby, a report to CPS is generally needed. When indicated, involving CPS will not only help to ensure the safety of the baby, but can also help the mother to get the help she may need. </p><p>After identifying the woman&rsquo;s needs, the case manager and social worker often collaborate to ensure these needs are met prior to her discharge. It is the role of the case manager to assist with home health needs, medication assistance, identification of a primary care physician for the child, and help in scheduling follow-up appointments. The social worker&rsquo;s role involves resource assistance, connection to community services, and advocating for the patient.</p><p>Various community case management programs are available to address these needs and to support the mother in her time of transition. These referrals are made by the social worker prior to the mother&rsquo;s discharge. At the time of discharge, assisting with transportation is generally required. Some shelters offer transportation to their residents; when this is not an option, the social worker will assist with transportation back to the shelter by providing a taxi voucher or utilizing transportation services through the mother&rsquo;s insurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. An infant car seat is generally mandated by state law, even for a short ride from the hospital to the shelter. If the mother cannot purchase or borrow a car seat, then the social worker can help arrange for one.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3090297\"><span class=\"h3\">Legal responsibilities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is difficult to define a physician&rsquo;s legal responsibilities related to the disposition of a homeless patient, as laws vary by state. Each case should be assessed on an individual basis with social work and case management to determine whether the patient and her infant are being discharged to a safe environment. Ideally, the involvement of a multidisciplinary team should ensure a smooth transition from the hospital. However, any concern with the child&rsquo;s welfare or the mother&rsquo;s ability to make choices that do not endanger her newborn should prompt a report to Children&rsquo;s Protective Services. Complicated cases may require involvement of the hospital&rsquo;s legal office or ethics committee, depending on the specific case. Tools to help clinicians with discharge planning are available from the National Health Care for the Homeless Council&rsquo;s website [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-homeless-women/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604324567\"><span class=\"h1\">RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"http://www.nhchc.org/&amp;token=VCiq5EE5hWdMn1SLVWK1D4tEkSzNWo5/gRZsni42MDw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=14183\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Health Care for the Homeless Council</a> provides a wide range of resources to help clinicians overcome the barriers they experience in providing health care to those who are homeless.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1170194794\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homelessness disproportionately affects women and children. Domestic and sexual violence is the leading cause of homelessness in women. Pregnancy is more common among homeless women than women who are not homeless. Pregnancy may be the precipitating event that leads a teenager to voluntarily or involuntarily leave her parents&rsquo; home. (See <a href=\"#H1158228770\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1158229001\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1158229055\" class=\"local\">'Etiology of homelessness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes is increased in homeless pregnant women due to poor access to health care, poor nutrition, lack of housing, substance abuse, exposure to violence, a high prevalence of infection, and medical co-morbidities. The most common complications are preterm delivery and low birth weight. (See <a href=\"#H1158229143\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Financial, physical, and psychosocial barriers impede homeless pregnant women from receiving prenatal care. (See <a href=\"#H1170194956\" class=\"local\">'Barriers to receiving health care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homeless pregnant women should receive routine prenatal care tailored to their specific needs, with emphasis on assessment of basic needs (eg, housing, food, clothing, transportation to appointments; evaluation for domestic violence, sexual abuse, substance abuse, mental illness, sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis; and examination of the skin, teeth and gums, and vision). (See <a href=\"#H1158229101\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discharge planning involves the various members of the interdisciplinary team to ensure that the basic needs of the mother and baby are met. The decision to involve Children&rsquo;s Protective Services (CPS) is made after evaluating whether or not the mother is making healthy choices for her child. (See <a href=\"#H3090189\" class=\"local\">'Discharge planning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538325551\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Nicole Ruddock Hall, MD, Sheryl D Perriatt, BSN, RNC, FAACM, and Casey W Hedges, LCSW, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">National Health Care for the Homeless Council.
