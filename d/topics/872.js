For the values shown in the table this would be a hemoglobin &lt;14.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (&lt;140 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> in men and &lt;12.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (&lt;123 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> in women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64238\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64238 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Alternatively, the 1968 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria of a hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (&lt;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> in men and &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (&lt;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> in women have been used to define anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, these criteria were based upon data in populations that did not include individuals &gt;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>], and may or may not be applicable to the older individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Normal ranges for hemoglobin/HCT'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Racial and ethnic considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is debate as to whether modifications in the definition of anemia should be made for different racial and ethnic groups. As an example, up to 30 percent of African-Americans carry the 3.7 kb deletion in the alpha thalassemia gene. In the heterozygous state (ie, silent carrier of alpha thalassemia, thalassemia minima) this leads to low-normal and occasionally mildly low hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume values, whereas homozygotes (ie, alpha thalassemia trait) have a mild, microcytic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, the presence of thalassemia may contribute to lowering of the average hemoglobin level in racial or ethnic groups having a high incidence of these mutations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There may be additional underlying factors that contribute to lowering of average hemoglobin levels in certain ethnic populations. As an example, when subjects with the alpha thalassemia -3.7 kb allele, iron deficiency, renal insufficiency, and sickle cell trait were removed from consideration, African-Americans still had significantly lower hemoglobin values when compared with a corresponding white population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Additional data bolstering this hypothesis is that the prevalence of anemia, using WHO criteria, is three-fold higher in elderly African-Americans relative to elderly Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Normal values for a population with a high incidence of chronic disease may be skewed toward anemic levels. Thus, anemia may be difficult to define in countries in which malnutrition, infection (eg, tuberculosis, malaria), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> congenital hematologic disorders (eg, thalassemia) are common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Public health issues in the thalassemic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Proposed definitions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Values for hemoglobin and hematocrit in apparently healthy older adults are generally lower than those in younger adults, and differences between males and females that are seen in younger adults are lessened with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In an attempt to more accurately determine normal hemoglobin ranges in elderly adults, two large databases, the third US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a nationally representative sampling of community-dwellers, and the Scripps-Kaiser database, collected in the San Diego area between 1998 and 2002 were evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Older subjects (&ge;59 years in men and &ge;49 years in women) with laboratory-based evidence of increased inflammation or renal insufficiency were excluded from consideration, which led to the elimination from the analysis of up to 50 percent of older black men and 40 percent of black women from the NHANES database.</p><p>Using the fifth percentile value of hemoglobin concentration, new lower limits of normal were proposed for older patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79757\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79757 \">table 2</a>). Compared with current WHO criteria, these values were slightly higher for older white men and women (13.2 and 12.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> respectively) and slightly lower for older black men and women (12.7 and 11.5, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Significance of these definitions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While further data are needed to confirm or refute the necessity for more precise age-, race-, and ethnicity-based definitions of anemia in the older adult, setting a lower limit of normal for hemoglobin does not imply that such levels are &quot;optimal&quot; in terms of morbidity and mortality. As an example, one study has suggested that the lower limits of an optimal hemoglobin level, as assessed by all-cause mortality data, are 14.0 and 13.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for elderly men and women, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>However, alternative criteria for anemia in the older adult might be required for different ethnic groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79757\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79757 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study in community dwelling older adults (age 71 to 82 years) confirmed the adverse effect of anemia, as defined by the WHO criteria, on mortality and mobility disability in white men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the same study, older black subjects classified as anemic by WHO criteria did not appear to be at risk for adverse events such as mortality and mobility disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of older people in a rural population in South West Uganda, classified as anemic by WHO criteria, did not find a strong association between WHO-defined anemia and functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The role of testosterone therapy in men with low testosterone levels and otherwise unexplained anemia was evaluated in a randomized trial in which men age 65 and older with low testosterone levels were assigned to receive testosterone gel or placebo for one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-the-older-adult/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. The minimization technique was used to ensure balance between the groups. Participants and treating clinicians were blinded to the assigned therapy. The trial included 62 men with unexplained anemia (hemoglobin level between 10 and 12.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span>. Individuals with hemoglobin &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> were excluded. Results were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with the placebo group, those assigned to receive testosterone gel were more likely to have a rise in hemoglobin of at least 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (15 versus 54 percent) and to have resolution of anemia at 12 months (22 versus 58 percent). Results were similar in men with baseline anemia of known cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increases in hemoglobin in anemic participants correlated with statistically significant but clinically modest improvements in six-minute walking distances, vitality, and participants' impressions of overall health and energy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testosterone treatment resulted in erythrocytosis (hemoglobin concentration of &gt;17.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> in six men who had not been anemic at baseline; four of the six had serum testosterone concentrations higher than 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> when erythrocytosis was detected.</p><p/><p>Further study is needed before testosterone therapy can be considered routine treatment for unexplained anemia in men with low testosterone levels. Moreover, potential benefits of testosterone therapy must be carefully weighed against possible risks, including cardiovascular and prostate effects, erythrocytosis, and venous thromboembolism. There is no role for testosterone administration in the management of anemia in individuals with normal testosterone levels.
