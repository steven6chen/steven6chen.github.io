Another definition is a hysterectomy performed any time from delivery to discharge from the same hospitalization. This topic will review the surgical planning, key operative points, and postoperative care for peripartum hysterectomy. </p><p>Related topics can be found separately and include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal hysterectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of preoperative evaluation and preparation for gynecologic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3261011085\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most recent population-level study shows a peripartum hysterectomy rate of nearly one per 1000 deliveries (eg, 0.1 percent) in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition to abnormal placentation, other significant risk factors for peripartum hysterectomy include advanced maternal age and parity, multiple gestations, antepartum bleeding, preeclampsia, bleeding disorders, and the use of assisted reproductive technologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. While the majority of patients with these risk factors will experience neither major hemorrhage nor hysterectomy, patients who have multiple risk factors or a history of prior postpartum hemorrhage should deliver in a setting where hysterectomy is readily available if needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL PLANNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure may be emergent or planned. The most common indication for emergent procedures is severe uterine hemorrhage that cannot be controlled by conservative measures. Such hemorrhage is most commonly due to abnormal placentation or uterine atony, with each accounting for 30 to 50 percent of peripartum hysterectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Other potential causes include uterine rupture, leiomyomas, and laceration of uterine vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>]. Planned peripartum hysterectomy may be performed in patients with an antepartum diagnosis of placenta accreta, or more rarely for stage IA2 and IB1 cervical carcinoma or very large fibroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Infection appears to be an important contributor to peripartum hysterectomy. Not only is severe postpartum pelvic infection a potential indication for the procedure, but uteri removed for atony also show a relatively high rate of infection and inflammation on pathologic analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The obstetrician should be prepared for the potential need to perform emergent peripartum hysterectomy, especially in patients with significant risk factors or heavy postpartum bleeding. Hysterectomy is not commonly performed on labor and delivery units; depending on local operating room resources, a general operating room may be necessary. An institution-specific labor and delivery unit checklist of equipment, other supplies, and action items that will be needed in the event of emergent hysterectomy can be helpful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F93723\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93723 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In emergency situations, a sequence of conservative measures to control uterine hemorrhage should be attempted before resorting to more radical surgical procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57307 \">table 2</a>). If an intervention does not succeed, the next treatment in the sequence should be swiftly instituted. Conservative measures should be employed with the goal of avoiding the morbidity and sterilization that comes with hysterectomy. For those patients who inevitably require hysterectomy, immediate performance of the procedure (without using multiple conservative measures) leads to a lower transfusion requirement and possibly less morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Moreover, there is increased blood loss with increased duration of time before performance of hysterectomy. Thus, conservative measures should be used in quick succession, and preparation for hysterectomy should begin promptly in cases of massive hemorrhage or maternal instability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1022164473\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes the obstetrician can anticipate the possible need for peripartum hysterectomy based on the patient&rsquo;s risk factors. This enables patient preparation and counseling in the antenatal period, detailed surgical planning, and possibly avoidance of an emergency procedure. This is true primarily for women with abnormal placentation.</p><p>Most patients with placenta accreta, increta, or percreta will undergo hysterectomy at delivery (79 of 133 patients [60 percent] in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]). Placenta previa is associated with an approximately 5 percent risk of hysterectomy, usually in cases with placenta accreta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The frequency of abnormal placentation rises substantially as the number of prior cesarean deliveries increases, as well as with maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placenta-previa-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placenta previa: Management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta#H1320730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the placenta accreta spectrum (placenta accreta, increta, and percreta)&quot;, section on 'Cesarean hysterectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Even in the absence of abnormal placentation, cesarean delivery, as well as prior uterine surgery, appears to be a risk factor for peripartum hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/2,3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,19</a>]. In a population-based, case-control study, the risk of peripartum hysterectomy was lowest in women undergoing a first delivery that was vaginal (1 in 30,000) and highest in women with a history of two or more prior cesarean deliveries (1 in 220) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a study of 30,000 women undergoing cesarean delivery, the risk of peripartum hysterectomy was &lt;1 percent for the first, second, or third cesareans; 2 to 4 percent for the fourth and fifth procedures; and 9 percent after six or more cesareans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. While abnormal placentation contributes to hysterectomy risk with repeat cesareans, it is unclear whether the increased risk with primary cesarean delivery relates to the surgery itself, or reflects the indication for cesarean. Indications such as abruption, infection, macrosomia, or multiple gestations are risk factors themselves for hemorrhage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> uterine atony. Alternatively, providers may move more quickly to hysterectomy for management of hemorrhage in patients whose abdomen is already open. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Physiologic mechanisms that limit postpartum blood loss'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Risk factors and specific etiologies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26335198\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients at risk for emergent peripartum hysterectomy should be counseled about the likelihood of the procedure and how the decision to proceed with hysterectomy will be made. Patients at risk and those with planned procedures should understand what the procedure involves, complications and outcomes of hysterectomy, and issues related to ovarian conservation. The patient should also be aware of the possible need for blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation, and recovery in an intensive care unit rather than a postpartum floor. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26335219\"><span class=\"h2\">Scheduling delivery of patients at high risk for cesarean hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients at high risk of needing cesarean hysterectomy should be scheduled for delivery at a time when surgical staff and resources are immediately available, preferably avoiding an emergency delivery after the onset of labor. Surgical scheduling and consultations should be arranged with appropriate ancillary staff, which may include high-risk anesthesiologists, interventional radiologists, gynecologic oncologists, and urologists, depending on the complexity of the case. The primary surgeon should have significant experience with pelvic surgery and hysterectomy. Transfer of care to a tertiary care center may be necessary if these resources are not locally available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5515337\"><span class=\"h2\">Total versus supracervical hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In scheduled gynecologic surgery, there are no proven medical or surgical benefits of performing supracervical or subtotal hysterectomy if the cervix can be easily removed with the corpus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease#H801890523\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a route of hysterectomy for benign disease&quot;, section on 'Supracervical (subtotal) hysterectomy'</a>.) However in obstetric cases, supracervical hysterectomy may be preferable because removal of the cervix can be particularly challenging when the cervix is significantly dilated. In addition, supracervical hysterectomy may decrease total blood loss and operative time, which is important in the setting of severe acute hemorrhage. As a general guide, the cervix should be removed if cervical injury or bleeding is contributing to the hemorrhage, or if a <span class=\"nowrap\">previa/accreta</span> may be invading the cervical stroma (often, this cannot be known with certainty until a pathologic analysis is performed). It is important to ensure that the entire placental bed has been removed in cases of placenta previa, which may require total hysterectomy or partial trachelectomy.</p><p>In a large study using data from the National Inpatient Sample, total hysterectomy was associated with more bladder and &quot;other&quot; (non-gastrointestinal, vascular, or ureteral) injuries, as well as more pulmonary complications and transfusion, but supracervical hysterectomy had higher rates of reoperation and perioperative death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although a retrospective cohort study reported no significant increase in complication rates when the cervix was removed after emergency cesarean delivery, surgical times were nearly identical with or without cervical removal, suggesting that the supracervical procedures may have been more complicated overall and that aborting cervical removal may have avoided excess morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5515403\"><span class=\"h2\">Placement of hypogastric artery balloon catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author does not place preoperative arterial catheters routinely before planned puerperal hysterectomies, given little evidence of benefit and concern for complications; however, practice patterns vary among providers. In selected cases, intraoperative uterine artery embolization may be helpful, although the benefits of this procedure are less clear when hysterectomy is to be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta#H1320709\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the placenta accreta spectrum (placenta accreta, increta, and percreta)&quot;, section on 'Balloon catheterization and arterial embolization'</a>.)</p><p>Preoperative placement of balloon catheters in the hypogastric arteries has been proposed as a means of decreasing total intraoperative blood loss in patients at risk for severe postpartum hemorrhage. The balloons are generally placed by interventional radiologists under fluoroscopic guidance immediately prior to surgery and inflated following delivery or in the event of hemorrhage. While many centers have published success with this intervention, only a few controlled nonrandomized studies have been reported, and results have been inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. In the largest of these, a retrospective case-control study of 117 patients with placenta accreta found that patients in whom an iliac balloon catheter was placed preoperatively had less blood loss than those without a catheter (2165 mL versus 2837 mL); 50 percent of patients with catheter placement actually had the balloon inflated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A limitation of this study is that placenta accreta was recognized antepartum in 98 percent of the catheter group, but in only 29 percent of those without catheter placement, and the analysis did not adjust for differences between groups in preoperative surgical preparation unrelated to catheter placement.</p><p>One randomized controlled trial of preoperative iliac balloon catheter placement has been reported. In this Israeli study of 27 women, surgical management was otherwise standardized, and the balloons were always inflated if placed. The authors reported no difference in perceived or measured blood loss when the balloon catheters were used and reported no vascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Significant catheter-related complications have been described. In one series (19 patients), 2 patients developed arterial thrombosis and 1 had an internal iliac arterial dissection (16 percent complication rate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In another study (59 patients), 1 patient developed a thrombosis and 1 had a catheter-site hematoma (4 percent complication rate). A third series of 21 patients who received common iliac balloons reported that 2 (9.5 percent) required postoperative arterial thrombectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5515492\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripartum hysterectomy differs from hysterectomy in nonpregnant women in several important respects, most of which make the operation more difficult:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cervix may be quite soft and difficult to identify, especially if the patient has labored.

Pedicles can be rapidly clamped and cut, and sutured later. When severe hemorrhage prohibits adequate visualization of the pelvis, the aorta can be compressed manually over the sacrum, and the pelvis carefully packed until the bleeding slows. A trauma surgeon may be consulted, if available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the patient is hemodynamically stable, obtaining adequate exposure and uterine traction will minimize vascular or ureteral injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the bladder does not reflect readily off the cervix, it should be opened at the dome. Palpation and inspection of the posterior bladder from the interior makes it easier to find the dissection plane between these two organs. In addition, the cervix may be fused to the bladder (especially in placental percreta), thus requiring resection of a portion of the bladder. Consultation with a gynecologic oncologist or urologist is warranted if the surgeon does not have sufficient experience with bladder surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every attempt should be made to identify the ureter and avoid ligating it. However, control of hemostasis is more important than preserving the ureter intact. Ligation of one or both ureters can be reversed in a subsequent operation after hemostasis has been achieved and coagulopathy and hypovolemia have been corrected.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Incision and delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author prefers a vertical skin incision to help ensure adequate exposure. If a transverse skin incision is performed, it should be as wide as possible, and the surgeon should be prepared to divide the rectus muscles (Maylard incision) or perform a Cherney approach, if the incision does not provide adequate exposure. A Pfannenstiel incision may be acceptable in thin patients without an anterior previa or prior pelvic surgical history, and at very low risk of having pelvic adhesions.</p><p>A low transverse incision is acceptable if it can be made without causing excessive bleeding. Avoiding disruption of a known abnormally implanted anterior placenta or transection of large anterior fibroids is best accomplished through a classical (fundal) uterine incision. A high hysterotomy may also be preferable in the setting of large bladder varicosities or significant anterior adhesions. The hysterotomy can be made hemostatic rapidly using atraumatic hemostatic clamps or a single running layer with sturdy suture (eg, loop #1 polydioxanone [eg, PDS]) on a large needle.</p><p>With a fundal hysterotomy, a fetus in vertex or transverse lie is most easily delivered as a breech. Following delivery of the fetus, the placenta should be removed, if nonadherent, to allow maximal uterine contraction. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxytocin</a> is then given to maintain uterine tone until the blood supply is disconnected. Any adherent placenta should be left in place as removal can increase total blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

In addition, insertion of an intrauterine balloon or intrauterine packing for tamponade slows severe bleeding. The balloon or pack should be removed during the hysterectomy as bleeding is controlled surgically because lateral bulging may impede uterine artery and cardinal ligament dissection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine balloon tamponade for control of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technique should be simple enough to perform rapidly and should minimize the creation of dead space and raw surfaces because of the possibility of coexistent coagulopathy.

The tissue between the clamps is divided using Mayo scissors or electro-dissection, and each clamp is replaced with a suture ligature. The broad ligament is then opened, and the adnexal pedicles are isolated. The ovaries are almost always left in place, unless a severely adherent ovary necessitates a lengthy dissection during a hemorrhagic emergency. The fallopian tube and utero-ovarian ligament are then isolated and clamped. Placing clamps directly on the uterus is desirable, but may be inadvisable in the setting of hypertrophic vessels. In this circumstance, identifying and opening a clear space below each vascular bundle should be attempted. Each pedicle is then clamped with a vascular clamp, transected, and suture ligated. This should be done in a single bundle, if possible, but may require multiple pedicles on each side if the bundle is too large to ligate safely. In the presence of severe hemorrhage, however, the operation can be performed more rapidly if the pedicles are not sutured until all of the vascular structures to the uterine arteries have been clamped and divided. This requires a sufficient number of clamps to be available. Use of a bipolar ligature device, such as the LigaSure instrument, allows the procedure to be performed more rapidly, but we still prefer to secure the proximal pedicles with sutures after the blood supply has been controlled.</p><p>The posterior leaf of the broad ligament is then opened towards the cervix, dropping the ureters inferiorly and clearing the endopelvic fascia posterior to the uterine vessels. The uterine vessels are then skeletonized by carefully opening overlying tissue with cautery. If cesarean delivery was performed, the bladder flap may have been developed. Otherwise, the bladder may be released by gently spreading the tips of Metzenbaum scissors or a tonsil clamp in the vesicouterine peritoneum and using electro-dissection to transect the serosa. The vesicocervical space is developed and bladder pillars divided, but no further distally than will be necessary to allow exposure and clamping of the uterine vessels. Large varicosities in the vesicouterine space, as can be seen with placenta previa or accreta, may require bipolar coagulation or clamping with suture ligation. Gentle finger dissection may speed the procedure once good planes have been created, but blunt dissection with a sponge stick is inadvisable as massive bleeding or bladder laceration may result. If scarring has obliterated the vesicocervical space (as can occur after previous cesarean deliveries), sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors may be necessary to perform this dissection.</p><p>If a difficult or highly vascular dissection is anticipated, then it may be prudent to secure the uterine blood supply prior to completing the midline bladder dissection. This may be accomplished by opening the paravesical spaces and clearing the endopelvic fascia just medial to the ascending uterine vessels. This allows the arteries to be safely clamped and sutured with bladder adhesions undisturbed. These bladder adhesions can then be taken down sharply or with cautery after the majority of the uterine blood supply has been controlled. When there is concern for placental bladder invasion, a posterior approach to the dissection may be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This involves opening the posterior vagina through the pouch of Douglas, then securing the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments and uterine arteries prior to developing the bladder plane from below. </p><p>The ureters are identified by visualizing them through the peritoneum of the posterior broad ligament, or by palpation when stented. If their position is in doubt, then the retroperitoneum should be opened further and the ureter directly visualized. Their position should be confirmed frequently during the procedure. </p><p>The uterine arteries may then be exposed by carefully dissecting the broad ligament. This often requires clamping or coagulating vessels within the ligament. Sequentially clamping and transecting the ascending uterine arteries, against the lateral uterus, may be most expedient, with the final pedicle containing the uterine vessels. However, caution should be used with a retained placenta accreta or percreta, in which case clamping of the vascular uterine tissue can lead to massive hemorrhage. In this circumstance, the uterine arteries should be dissected and identified lateral to the uterus, and clamped at their insertion. This requires identification of the ureters either visually or by palpation (in the case of stenting) as the arteries are clamped. At least one retrospective study has shown that preoperative ureteral stenting was associated with a significant reduction in early postoperative morbidity, possibly by facilitating the identification of the ureters or ureteral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Once the major vessels have been ligated and the bladder has been displaced inferiorly, each cardinal ligament is divided in several bites by clamping close to the cervix with a straight clamp, dividing the tissue medially with scissors or a scalpel, and suturing the pedicle. After dissecting the upper cardinal ligaments, a supracervical hysterectomy can be performed by clamping the lateral cervical vessels and transecting the mid cervix with scissors or electrosurgery. After ligating the lateral vascular pedicles, the cervical edges are oversewn with figure-of-eight or running sutures. In the setting of a placenta previa, the excised boundary of the cervix should be examined to ensure that a cuff of clear endocervix lies beneath the placental bed.</p><p>Alternatively, if the cervix is to be completely removed, the cul-de-sac is examined to ensure that the rectal reflection is not abnormally high. The bladder is further reflected off the entire cervix and the proximal vagina. The cardinal ligaments are clamped and transected with incorporation of the lateral cervical vessels until the base of the cervix is reached. If the distal cervix is difficult to identify, the cervix may be transected above the level of vessel dissection and the uterine specimen removed. The external cervical os can then be palpated through this incision and used to define the distal limit of cardinal ligament dissection. The vaginal angle and uterosacral ligament on each side are clamped into a bundle with a curved clamp. The vagina is then severed with scissors medial to each clamp. Following this, each clamp is replaced with a suture ligature. The remainder of the vaginal cuff is closed with a running suture. Incorporating the peritoneum posteriorly may aid hemostasis. The suture should include about 10 mm of the upper vaginal cuff to avoid later bleeding or breakdown; in this process, it is important to avoid the bladder anteriorly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation of bladder and ureteral integrity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Integrity of the bladder can be confirmed by infusing 200 mL of saline mixed with two or three drops of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> through the bladder catheter; extravasation of blue fluid signifies a leak. The ureters are inspected to determine that they are intact, peristalsing, and of normal caliber. If there is concern for ureteral injury, this may be tested by injecting one to two ampules (5 mL per ampule) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a> intravenously; blue urine will spill into the pelvis in 10 to 15 minutes if a ureter has been cut. This method is, however, unlikely to reveal ligation of the ureter. Cystoscopy or direct visualization of the ureters through a cystotomy (the latter requiring urine dye) demonstrate urine passing through both ureteral orifices. Absence of this finding suggests that one or both ureters are obstructed as a result of surgery. A ureteral stent can be passed through the ureteral orifice to localize the site of obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Identification and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If a cystotomy has been created inadvertently or intentionally, it should be closed with two layers of absorbable synthetic suture. If the injury occurs at the level of the bladder trigone, stenting may be necessary, and urologic consultation is recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Identification and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5515605\"><span class=\"h3\">Inspection and closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pelvis should be copiously irrigated and suctioned, and blood-soaked packs should be removed. Each vascular pedicle should be checked for hemostasis, as should the dissection sites. The abdomen is closed using any standard technique, after ensuring good hemostasis. No drains are necessary, unless there is concern for ongoing bleeding or persistent bladder leak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTROL OF PERSISTENT PELVIC BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding in the deep pelvis may persist following hysterectomy. Coagulation status must be assessed with laboratory testing and, if abnormal, managed with transfusion of blood products, patient warming, and correction of acidemia and hypocalcemia. Prior to the return of the first set of laboratory studies, a red top tube of 5 mL blood can be observed for clotting. If the blood in the tube clots within 8 to 10 minutes and the clot remains intact, the patient likely has adequate fibrinogen stores. If the blood in the tube does not clot or an initial clot dissolves, it is likely that the patient is markedly deficient in key clotting factors.</p><p>Surgical hemostasis may be achieved by placing running and figure-of-eight absorbable sutures in bleeding areas or with the direct application of cautery. If this does not control bleeding, hemostatic agents and pelvic packing are the next steps.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemostatic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small areas of low-volume bleeding can be treated with topical hemostatic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Investigation of these agents has focused on vascular, cardiac, and hepatic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. There are few high-quality data regarding treatment efficacy or use in obstetric and gynecologic surgery. Thus, choices are made based on surgeon preference, availability, and cost effectiveness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71852 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hemorrhage in gynecologic surgery&quot;, section on 'Topical hemostatic agents'</a>.)</p><p>These agents should not be used for intravascular injection, in closure of skin incisions, or for treatment of bleeding from the endometrium. They also should not be used in infected tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic packing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Packing is a last resort that usually succeeds in controlling low-pressure (microvascular or venous) bleeding confined to the pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Kerlix bandages may be tied together end-to-end to form one long strip for packing. If Kerlix is not available, dry laparotomy sponges may be used. The dry sponges are packed gently but firmly into the pelvis so that the pack fills all interstices, but does not abrade pelvic tissue. If the packing is successful, no blood will be seen seeping through or around the gauze after 10 minutes of observation.</p><p>Most often, a temporary abdominal closure will be placed over the packings, possibly with the addition of a negative pressure wound system to remove fluids and avoid an abdominal compartment syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the open abdomen in adults&quot;</a>). Different surgeons practice slight variations of this procedure; an alternate approach which places a x-ray cassette drape which has been stuffed with gauze has been described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F93394\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93394 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/41-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-49</a>]. These patients usually require intensive care unit admission to manage coagulopathy, ventilation, hypothermia, and metabolic abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hemorrhage in gynecologic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Laparotomy is usually needed to remove the pack, or it may be removed through the vagina or another conduit. Postoperative fever is common, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are given until the packing is removed, usually 48 hours after insertion.</p><p>The gauze pack is removed under general anesthesia on the second day after insertion. Bleeding may resume if the pack is removed too early or in the presence of coagulopathy, whereas pelvic infection is likely if removal is delayed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal complications after peripartum hysterectomy are febrile morbidity, hemorrhage, urinary tract injury, coagulopathy, paralytic ileus or bowel obstruction, and reoperation. Emergent procedures are associated with a higher rate of complications than planned procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Mortality should be &lt;1 percent, though a global summary of emergent cases reported mortality rates ranging from 0 to 59 percent, with a composite rate of 5.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-hysterectomy-for-management-of-hemorrhage/abstract/4,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,51</a>].

Pharmacologic prophylaxis is initiated at least four hours postoperatively; timing depends on patient-specific factors in the balance between risk of bleeding and risk of venous thrombosis, and whether a neuraxial catheter is left in place after surgery is completed.

The bladder catheter can also be removed within 24 hours postoperatively in stable patients who do not require monitoring hourly urinary output. However, if a cystotomy was repaired, then drainage is generally continued for 5 to 10 days. A large repair (&gt;2 cm) should be evaluated with a cystourethrogram prior to discontinuing the catheter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Identification and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H161228\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clear liquids are ordered after surgery, and the diet is advanced with patient appetite and tolerance of oral intake. Nausea, anorexia, abdominal distention, or vomiting are signs of paralytic ileus. Mild symptoms can be managed with restriction of oral intake and intravenous fluids, while more severe vomiting should be evaluated radiographically. Confirmed ileus or partial obstruction should be treated with nasogastric suction with intravenous fluid and electrolyte repletion.

Patients admitted to the intensive care unit may use a breast pump once they are extubated and stabilized. Early pumping is encouraged when the newborn is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Breast milk output should be considered in the patient&rsquo;s fluid management, although this is usually not a concern by the time her milk supply develops. In the setting of a physically or psychologically difficult recovery, patients who are unwilling or unable to breastfeed should be supported.</p><p>Sheehan syndrome should be considered in women who fail to lactate postpartum or develop other manifestations of hypopituitarism.

Timing is critical to an optimal outcome: hysterectomy should not be performed too early or too late. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticipating the possible need for peripartum hysterectomy based on the patient&rsquo;s risk factors enables patient preparation and counseling in the antenatal period, detailed surgical planning, and possibly avoidance of an emergency procedure. (See <a href=\"#H1022164473\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative risk assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26335219\" class=\"local\">'Scheduling delivery of patients at high risk for cesarean hysterectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5515492\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The author does not place preoperative arterial balloon catheters routinely before planned puerperal hysterectomies, given little evidence of benefit and concern for complications.

A Pfannenstiel incision may be acceptable in thin patients with no previa or large fibroids, and at very low risk of having adhesions.

Pedicles can be rapidly clamped and cut, and sutured later.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When the patient is hemodynamically stable, obtaining adequate exposure and uterine traction will minimize vascular or ureteral injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It may be difficult to determine the boundary between the cervix and vagina as a dilated cervix is effaced and soft. Placing sutures, clips, or a ring forceps to &quot;tag&quot; the cervix reduces this problem. Before a planned total hysterectomy, the external os may be tagged with sutures (if no previa) or a tagged (counted) sponge, sponge stick, or end-to-end anastomosis sizer may be placed vaginally to aid intraoperative cervical and vaginal identification.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the bladder does not reflect readily off the cervix, it should be opened at the dome. Palpation and inspection of the posterior bladder from the interior makes it easier to find the dissection plane between these two organs. In addition, the cervix may be fused to the bladder (especially in placental percreta), thus requiring resection of a portion of the bladder. Consultation with a gynecologic oncologist or urologist is warranted if the surgeon does not have sufficient experience with bladder surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Every attempt should be made to identify the ureter and avoid ligating it.
