The management of patients with traumatic injuries presents a variety of challenges. Patients have usually undergone multidisciplinary evaluation, resuscitation, and stabilization in the emergency department and possible operative intervention prior to inpatient admission. Patients remain at risk for complications due to unrecognized injuries or related to initial or ongoing management.</p><p>The general care and management of injured patients who require hospital admission is reviewed here. Initial evaluation and treatment in the emergency department is discussed separately. Specific injuries are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal gunshot wounds in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ongoing inpatient assessment and monitoring is critical to managing injured patients. This is particularly true in patients who have undergone damage control surgery or those with injuries that are being managed nonoperatively, such as blunt splenic, hepatic, duodenal, or pancreatic injury. Recognition of the full extent of traumatic injury requires an accurate history, skillful physical examination, and timely and judicious use of diagnostic studies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Obtain a complete history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with serious traumatic injuries often are unable to give details of their past medical history upon presentation to the emergency department, and collateral sources of information (eg, family or friends) may not be available initially. It is therefore incumbent upon the admitting clinician to obtain additional information about past medical history, outpatient medications, allergies, and any history of drug or alcohol use.</p><p>It is also important to obtain information about the circumstances that led to the injury since falls from a height or motor vehicle collisions may have been precipitated by medical causes such as cardiac dysrhythmia, hypoglycemia, or stroke and injuries from assault may be a result of domestic violence. In addition, self-inflicted injuries may be a manifestation of a psychological disorder that needs to be identified and treated.</p><p>In addition to its value in optimizing medical management, accurate information about the medical history can be valuable in estimating prognosis. The patient's baseline health status also affects the length of stay. One study of over 27,000 trauma admissions found that the probability of a trauma patient remaining hospitalized for more than three weeks nearly doubles with the presence of at least one significant underlying medical condition, such as end-stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H172458919\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p>In one study, ongoing drug or alcohol dependence was present in over 30 percent of individuals admitted for trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These individuals had increased risk of complications during hospitalization, particularly those related to pneumonia and other infections. These patients are at risk for withdrawal syndromes, which may be difficult to recognize in the setting of obtundation, intubation, or closed-head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The possibility of an intentional drug overdose prior to injury should also be considered. (See <a href=\"#H172460043\" class=\"local\">'Alcohol/drug screening'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and management of unhealthy alcohol use in the perioperative period&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172457110\"><span class=\"h2\">Repeat the physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The injured patient admitted from the emergency department or operating room warrants full reassessment by the receiving team in accordance with advanced trauma life support (ATLS) guidelines. Missed injuries are more likely to occur in the patient with polytrauma who requires emergent surgical intervention. Performing a repeat trauma survey (tertiary survey) on all patients decreases the frequency of missed injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A review of observational studies that included over 12,000 trauma patients found a significantly increased risk of missed injury for trauma patients who did not have a tertiary survey compared with those who did (odds ratio 2.65, 95% CI 1.40-5.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Consider other potential injuries'</a> below.)</p><p>Immediate attention should be given to the ABCs (ie, airway, breathing, and circulation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breath sounds should be evaluated, and, if the patient is intubated, the position of the endotracheal tube should be assessed to ensure that it has not become dislodged during transport. (See <a href=\"#H172457118\" class=\"local\">'Review diagnostic studies'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's cardiovascular status should be evaluated, the patency of peripheral and central intravascular catheters confirmed, and the total volume of intravenous fluids administered since presentation established.

Sedatives may need to be withheld to obtain an accurate assessment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete vascular examination should be repeated and documented. Patients with extremity injury should have ankle pressures taken bilaterally and each compared with their systolic brachial pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H58544655\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'Ankle-brachial index'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be examined completely, from head to toe, and front to back, to evaluate for unidentified external injuries and to note and confirm the correct positioning of any catheters, chest tubes, or drains that have been placed. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172457118\"><span class=\"h2\">Review diagnostic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each of the diagnostic studies the patient has previously undergone, including plain films and computed tomography (CT) studies, should be reviewed and the final radiology report obtained. Plans should be made to obtain follow-up studies for injuries that have been identified, when indicated. Incidental findings not related to trauma should be reported to the patient and the patient's primary care provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Repeat chest radiograph should be ordered upon patient arrival to verify accurate endotracheal tube position, if present, and reassess the status of the lungs. The correct internal positioning of any chest tubes or central lines should also be verified, particularly those that may have been placed emergently (in the emergency department or operating room). (See <a href=\"#H172459593\" class=\"local\">'Catheters, tubes, drains, and lines'</a> below.)</p><p>Particular attention should be given to any films that may have been performed in the operating room as a result of an incomplete sponge count. Patients who have undergone damage control surgery are at high risk for retained surgical foreign body, and misinterpretation of films obtained in the operating room is not uncommon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retained-surgical-sponge-gossypiboma-and-other-retained-surgical-items-prevention-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retained surgical sponge (gossypiboma) and other retained surgical items: Prevention and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Consider other potential injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In spite of diagnostic guidelines for the initial evaluation in trauma, the reported incidence of missed injuries ranges from 1.3 to 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. The true incidence of missed injuries and delayed diagnoses is difficult to determine, in part, because of the variability in the definition of what constitutes a missed injury. Missed injuries have been shown to increase morbidity, prolong hospital stay, and increase mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. </p><p>Missed injuries are more commonly associated with an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) &gt;3, but missed injuries that are life-threatening are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Reasons cited for missed diagnoses include assessment errors, misinterpretation of radiographs, and, for musculoskeletal injuries, lack of radiographs of the specific area of injury. A review of 1124 patients admitted to a level I trauma center identified missed injuries in 8 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The missed injury involved an extremity in 68 percent of patients. Significant factors associated with missed injury were injury severity score (ISS) &ge;16 and Glasgow coma scale &lt;8. Of the 122 missed injuries, 72 were missed in spite of a tertiary survey. In another review in which the missed injury rate was 15 percent, higher injury severity score (ISS), higher maximum Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) of the thorax, and nonsurgeon trauma team leader status were significant predictors of missed injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Injuries can also be missed during emergent exploratory laparotomy. In a database review from two level I trauma centers, 19 of 90 patients who underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy for penetrating (n = 66) or blunt (n = 25) trauma had additional injuries within the surgical field that were not identified intraoperatively but were diagnosed on postoperative abdominopelvic CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The injuries included mostly solid organ injuries but also unexpected active bleeding, a diaphragmatic injury, spine injury, colonic injury, and arteriovenous fistula. Eight of the injuries (8.9 percent of the entire cohort) were severe enough to require additional treatment (surgery or angioembolization). Undiagnosed fractures were also identified. Rates of unsuspected injuries within the surgical field were similar for patients who were empirically imaged compared with those with specific indications for CT (20.9 versus 21.4 percent). However, those with a specific indication for CT had a higher rate of intervention (14.2 versus 6.5 percent). These retrospective findings suggest that when clinical suspicion is present (unknown trajectory of penetrating missile or unexplored regions following blunt trauma), postoperative CT imaging can be useful to elucidate additional injuries, but whether empiric imaging is useful is not clear. </p><p>A concerted effort should be made to identify potentially life-threatening injuries that can be missed so that they may be properly treated. These are discussed briefly below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172465552\"><span class=\"h3\">Intra-abdominal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A missed or delayed diagnosis of intra-abdominal injury constitutes an important cause of preventable death in injured patients, particularly in the setting of blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. </p><p>A review of 607 abdominal trauma patients reported that 2 percent of patients had injuries that were missed on initial evaluation or at first surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Missed diagnoses were attributed to clinical inexperience, overlooked or atypical radiographic findings, and an unclear history of trauma. </p><p>A missed intra-abdominal injury should be suspected in patients with blunt or penetrating trauma who have evidence of ongoing acidosis, persistent tachycardia, need for ongoing fluid resuscitation or transfusion, abdominal sepsis, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Abdominal sepsis is a late finding, whereas the other clinical signs usually manifest within 24 to 36 hours of injury. </p><p>Tests to diagnose intra-abdominal injury include computed tomography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and diagnostic peritoneal lavage. However, exploratory laparotomy remains the gold standard and should be performed in any patient for whom a significant operable injury is suspected but that cannot be determined by abdominal examination (eg, intubated, spinal cord injury) along with available diagnostic studies. Diagnostic laparoscopy may represent a less invasive means to directly examine the peritoneal cavity and its contents. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172465526\"><span class=\"h3\">Diaphragm injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diaphragm injuries, particularly related to penetrating trauma, are often difficult to detect. A high index of suspicion should be maintained in patients with injury mechanisms that are associated with diaphragm rupture, such as simultaneous injuries above and below the diaphragm, and liver and spleen injuries, among others. The clinical evaluation and diagnosis of diaphragm injury in adults is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recognition-and-management-of-diaphragmatic-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recognition and management of diaphragmatic injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary contusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary contusion, which is injury to the parenchyma of the lung, is the most common lung injury identified in the setting of blunt chest trauma, occurring in 17 percent of multiple trauma patients. The associated mortality rate ranges from 6 to 25 percent, often due to a superimposed pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Common mechanisms of pulmonary contusion include rapid deceleration in high-speed motor vehicle collisions, falls, assault, penetrating injury, and blast injury (often combined blunt and penetrating trauma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Pulmonary contusion is often not initially suspected because the clinical and radiographic findings (homogenous opacification of the lung) are delayed. In addition, pulmonary contusion can occur in the absence of any visible chest wall injury or radiographic evidence of rib fractures, particularly in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The treatment is supportive. As with any soft tissue contusion, the extent of injury can be progressive in the initial days following injury, and the patient must be monitored for respiratory failure during this time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172462046\"><span class=\"h3\">Arterial injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blunt injury to an artery may not be immediately apparent depending upon the location and grade of the injury. High-grade injuries (pseudoaneurysm, transection) are usually symptomatic, causing hard signs of arterial injury (pain, pulsatile mass, hypotension, extremity ischemia); however, intimal tears are often asymptomatic. These lesions may remain static or progress as a subintimal dissection that can cause luminal narrowing or acute vessel occlusion over a variable period of time, reducing distal perfusion. These low-grade (minimal) injuries need to be identified so that appropriate therapy, which can be nonsurgical, can be initiated. The diagnosis and management of injuries to the vasculature is discussed in separate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremity vascular injury &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunt cerebrovascular injury &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt cerebrovascular injury: Mechanisms, screening, and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-treatment-and-outcomes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt cerebrovascular injury: Treatment and outcomes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic injury &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt thoracic aortic injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and endovascular repair of blunt thoracic aortic injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172463302\"><span class=\"h3\">Head injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although uncommon, serious intracranial injuries may remain undetected due to a failure to obtain an indicated head CT (penetrating injury, depressed skull fractures, altered mental status), error in interpretation of brain imaging studies, or because the injury was not apparent on the initial scan. Repeat and ongoing neurologic assessment (eg, alteration in mental status, new focal neurologic deficit) determines the need to obtain additional imaging studies. </p><p>Patients with traumatic brain injury may have indications for intracranial pressure monitoring, and repeat imaging should be used liberally for unexplained rises in intracranial pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute severe traumatic brain injury&quot;, section on 'Intracranial pressure'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who remain obtunded without a discernible cause on CT scan should undergo further evaluation for possible seizures.

Other laboratories are obtained based upon diagnosis. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete blood count is obtained and compared to values obtained upon arrival in the emergency department or in the operating room. Serial hemoglobin measurement may be useful to trend slow, internal bleeding but is of limited use in guiding transfusion therapy in patients with brisk bleeding. Most importantly, an active search must be initiated to find and arrest the source of hemorrhage. Serial counts are typically obtained every six hours (and as needed based upon clinical condition) in patients with conservatively managed solid organ injuries (liver, spleen, kidney) and in patients with pelvic fracture. In patients without evidence of bleeding, the frequency of repeat blood counts depends upon the clinical situation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal function &ndash; Renal function tests (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine) should be obtained daily in patients who received intravenous contrast agents, particularly if the patient is at high risk for contrast-induced nephropathy, such as patients with chronically impaired renal function and those who received contrast agents while hypovolemic. A serum creatinine concentration that begins to increase within 24 to 48 hours of contrast administration, with or without oliguria, may indicate contrast-induced nephropathy. The serum creatinine concentration generally reaches a peak after three to five days and then returns to baseline over a period of one to three weeks. Therapy of contrast-induced nephropathy is primarily supportive; dialysis is rarely required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulation parameters &ndash; Coagulopathy in the injured patient may be the result of physiologic derangements such as acidosis, hypothermia, hemodilution, and tissue disruption. An acute coagulopathy can occur in severely injured patients independent of these factors. Coagulopathy can be especially profound following severe traumatic brain injury due to release of brain thromboplastin into the blood stream. Early recognition and management using appropriate transfusion strategies is important to reduce morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coagulopathy associated with trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Injured patients with normal coagulation parameters on arrival to the emergency department and who do not have signs of bleeding do not require repeat coagulation tests. Those patients who have received massive transfusions or who have ongoing transfusion requirements should have coagulation studies performed every four to six hours or following administration of procoagulant agents until the coagulation parameters are corrected. The American College of Surgeons recommends that level I and level II verified trauma centers have elastography (thromboelastography [TEG] or rotational thromboelastometry [ROTEM]) capability. These tests may be useful in detecting the specific cause of coagulopathy, including inappropriate clot dissolution, thereby allowing more targeted component repletion or pharmacologic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma#H3046566855\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coagulopathy associated with trauma&quot;, section on 'Thromboelastography'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creatine kinase and myoglobin &ndash; Rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria can develop in patients with significant muscle injury, including crush injuries, prolonged immobilization, compartment syndrome, and ischemia-reperfusion following repair of vascular injuries in those who have undergone extensive embolization to arrest hemorrhage (eg, hypogastric artery). Rhabdomyolysis presents with elevated serum muscle enzymes (including creatine kinase), red-to-brown urine due to myoglobinuria if there is persistent renal function, and electrolyte abnormalities. Peak serum creatine kinase levels depend upon the volume of muscle breakdown and the muscle mass of the patient. Creatine kinase values should be measured if there is a suspicion for rhabdomyolysis until decreasing levels are observed. A brisk urine output should be maintained with intravenous fluid therapy until the creatine kinase value starts to decrease. Additionally, the potassium level should be monitored. Potassium levels may decrease due to the brisk urine output or increase if renal function deteriorates or there is ongoing myocyte necrosis. Alkalinization of the urine is no longer routinely recommended in trauma patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial blood gas &ndash; A baseline arterial blood gas (ABG) should be obtained in all mechanically ventilated patients to ensure appropriate ventilation and carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>). Further, an assessment of the patient's <span class=\"nowrap\">acid/base</span> can be made based on the pH. Point-of-care testing and STAT labs can be obtained for ABGs in a rapid fashion in most institutions. This allows for serial assessment as changes to pulmonary mechanics occur.

In addition, fluid effluent from an open abdomen results in significant protein loss, which can be estimated as 2 g of nitrogen per liter of abdominal fluid lost.

However, mortality and renal injury attributable to colloids were observed only in critically ill patients with sepsis. </p><p>An absolute correlation between extensive intravenous contrast loading (&gt;150 mL) and kidney dysfunction has not been found in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/116,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">116,117</a>]. The true incidence of nephrotoxicity is unknown but is probably less than 1 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is evolving evidence on the utility of serum and urine biomarkers to predict onset of AKI and probability of renal recovery. However, these studies are mostly in the overall critically ill population and not specific to the trauma cohort. Once AKI is established, the treatment is primarily supportive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172468713\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter-associated blood stream infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of catheter-associated infection is higher in trauma populations, which may be due to the placement of lines under less-than-ideal conditions. Issues related to catheter-associated blood stream infection are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-intravascular-catheter-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of intravascular catheter infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172458919\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6927165\"><span class=\"h2\">Civilian morbidity and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early recognition and treatment of patients at risk for complications may help reduce morbidity and mortality. Multivariate analysis of data from over 30,000 patients identified the following independent risk factors for multiorgan failure (MOF), which has a high rate of death: increasing age, higher injury severity score, head abbreviated injury scale (AIS) &ge;3, thoracic AIS &ge;3, male sex, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) &le;8, massive transfusion, base excess &lt;-3, systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg on admission, and presence of coagulopathy. A scoring system using parameters obtained within four hours of presentation to the emergency department may help predict those who could develop MOF within seven days of hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. Elements of the Denver Emergency Department Trauma Organ Failure (TOF) scoring system include age &ge;54 years (1 point), emergency intubation (3 points), hematocrit &lt;20 percent (2 points), hematocrit &ge;20 percent and &lt;35 percent (1 point), emergency department systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg (1 point), and white blood cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;20,000/microL</span> (1 point). Based on this scoring system, the risk of MOF can be considered low, moderate, or high for scores of 0 to 1, 2 to 3, or &gt;4, respectively. Among 2072 patients in a multicenter study, 120 (6 percent) developed MOF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. MOF developed in 3 percent of those with low score, 26 percent of those with moderate score, and 36 percent of those with high scores. </p><p>Mortality among victims of civilian trauma is substantially increased in the presence of one or more underlying chronic conditions. As an example, one study of approximately 7800 patients admitted with traumatic injures found that patients with at least one underlying medical condition had a significantly higher mortality compared with patients without such conditions (9 versus 3 percent), despite similar Glasgow Coma and Injury Severity Scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. Underlying renal disease, malignancy, or cardiac disease were particularly ominous indicators. Similar associations have been observed in the APACHE and other models of illness severity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Predictive scoring systems in the intensive care unit&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Obesity also appears to worsen outcomes in trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/122,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">122,123</a>]. A systematic review of 18 studies compared outcomes in 7751 patients with a body mass index [BMI] &ge;30, with patients with BMI &lt;30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. The injury severity score (ISS) was similar between the groups. Using a random effects model, the pooled estimate of effect showed that obese patients had a significantly increased risk of death, complications (acute renal failure, multiorgan failure, adult respiratory distress), and length of stay in the intensive care unit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172468209\"><span class=\"h2\">Organ donation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impending trauma deaths should be called in to the local organ procurement organization (OPO) regardless of age, injury, or comorbidity. Management of the potential organ donor can be very challenging and is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-brain-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of brain death&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the potential deceased donor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A cooperative relationship between trauma centers and the local OPO is essential. Importantly, members of the treating team should <strong>not</strong> engage in discussions related to organ donation with the patient's family. Procurement rate improves when trained personnel initiate these discussions, and as such, all discussion should be deferred to the OPO.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The injured patient admitted from the emergency department or operating room warrants full reassessment of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> medical history. Patients with ongoing alcohol or drug dependence are more likely to have complications during their hospital stay, while patients with medical comorbidities have an increased risk of mortality. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Patient assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat head-to-toe trauma examination (tertiary survey) on all patients decreases the frequency of missed injuries. Missed injuries are more common in multiply injured patients who require emergent surgical intervention shortly after hospital arrival. Extremity injuries are commonly missed. Significant injuries that can be missed during the initial evaluation include intra-abdominal injury, diaphragm injury, pulmonary contusion, arterial injury, and intracranial injury. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Consider other potential injuries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventive strategies are important to reduce the incidence of common complications and include monitoring to identify and treat extremity and abdominal compartment syndromes, as indicated by the patient's injuries, and prophylactic therapies such as antibiotics prior to surgical intervention, thromboprophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, steroid prophylaxis for those on chronic therapy, and prophylaxis for <span class=\"nowrap\">drug/alcohol</span> withdrawal. (See <a href=\"#H172465423\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for compartment syndromes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H172458230\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis and preventive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications that may arise in injured patients are often related to specific injuries (eg, biliary fistula) but may also be due to incomplete or absent prophylaxis (eg, deep vein thrombosis), lack of monitoring (eg, abdominal compartment syndrome), or complications arising from diagnostic and resuscitative efforts (eg, contrast-media-associated nephropathy, transfusion-associated acute lung injury), prolonged ventilation (eg, ventilator-associated pneumonia), or immobilization (eg, pressure ulcers).
