Iliac artery aneurysm presents in a variety of ways. Approximately one-half of patients are asymptomatic, and the remaining patients have symptoms related to thromboembolism or to compression of surrounding pelvic structures by the aneurysm. The primary goal of treatment is to prevent iliac artery rupture, which is associated with high mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When iliac artery aneurysm repair is indicated, an open surgical or endovascular approach can be used. The choice of repair depends upon the clinical presentation, location of the aneurysm, coexistent abdominal aortic aneurysm, and patient comorbidities.</p><p>Open surgical and endovascular repair of iliac artery aneurysm will be reviewed here.

The renal arteries arise at the level of the second lumbar vertebra. The lower aortic segment gives off the inferior mesenteric artery and four paired lumbar arteries (L1-L4). The fifth pair of lumbar arteries may arise from the CIAs or from the middle sacral artery. </p><p>The CIA is approximately 5 cm in length and divides into the external and internal iliac arteries at the pelvic inlet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60420 \">figure 2</a>). The external iliac artery (EIA) gives off the inferior epigastric and deep circumflex iliac arteries before passing beneath the inguinal ligament to become the common femoral artery, which perfuses the lower extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The internal iliac artery (IIA), also called the hypogastric artery, typically divides into anterior and posterior trunks, though the branching pattern is variable. The branches of the IIA supply the pelvic viscera (colon, reproductive organs), the pelvic and buttock musculature, and the medial aspect of the thigh.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anterior trunk branches include the vesical, obturator, middle hemorrhoidal, inferior gluteal, and internal pudendal arteries, and the uterine and vaginal arteries in women. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The vesical arteries supply the bladder and ureter and, in males, the spermatic cord and prostate. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The obturator artery supplies the pelvic bone, iliacus muscle, and musculature of the medial thigh, including the adductors and the gracilis muscle. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The middle hemorrhoidal artery supplies the rectum and collateralizes with the superior and inferior hemorrhoidal arteries, which are derived from the inferior mesenteric and internal pudendal arteries, respectively. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The inferior gluteal artery supplies the buttock musculature and the posterior aspect of the thigh.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The internal pudendal artery supplies branches to the external reproductive organs (penis, clitoris). Other branches of the internal pudendal artery include the inferior hemorrhoidal, perineal, and urethral arteries as well as a branch to the pelvic floor musculature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The uterine artery supplies the uterus and cervix and gives rise to the vaginal artery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The posterior trunk branches include the iliolumbar, lateral sacral, and superior gluteal arteries. The superior gluteal artery is the largest branch, and it divides into a superficial and a deep branch. The superficial branch communicates with the inferior gluteal artery to supply the buttock musculature. The deep branch subdivides into superior and inferior divisions. The superior division joins the deep circumflex iliac artery and the ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery. The inferior division communicates with the lateral femoral circumflex artery. These vessels supply the buttock musculature and the hip joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>Adequate collateral flow to the pelvic organs is important for preventing ischemia of the pelvic organs during iliac artery embolization procedures. (See <a href=\"#H519609239\" class=\"local\">'Internal iliac artery embolization'</a> below.)</p><p>Collateral flow comes from aortic (eg, lumbar arteries, middle sacral artery) and inferior mesenteric artery branches (eg, superior hemorrhoidal arteries) and is also present between the anterior and posterior trunks of the IIA as described above. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519608343\"><span class=\"h1\">OPEN SURGICAL VERSUS ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR OF ILIAC ARTERY ANEURYSMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For elective repair of iliac artery aneurysm in patients with suitable aortoiliac anatomy, we suggest endovascular repair over open surgical repair. Although primary iliac artery patency and mortality rates are not significantly different between open and endovascular repair, endovascular repair is associated with significantly decreased morbidity, an important advantage given that these patients are older and frequently have important comorbidities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iliac-artery-aneurysm#H107323044\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iliac artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Iliac artery aneurysm has traditionally been repaired using open surgical techniques. As with abdominal aortic aneurysm, endovascular repair of iliac artery aneurysm is an alternative method for managing iliac artery aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>The advantages of endovascular repair of iliac artery aneurysm include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elimination of the complications associated with pelvic dissection such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Damage to sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, resulting in erectile dysfunction or retrograde ejaculation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Disruption of lymphatic channels, resulting in lymphatic leak</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of open surgery in patients with prior abdominal or pelvic surgery </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction of perioperative morbidity, thus allowing the treatment of patients at high risk for open surgery </p><p/><p>The main disadvantages of endovascular repair are the need for intravenous contrast administration and lifelong surveillance imaging that may increase the risk for renal dysfunction and radiation-related sequelae, respectively.</p><p>There are no randomized trials comparing open with endovascular repair of iliac artery aneurysm, and it is difficult to make comparisons because abdominal aortic and iliac artery aneurysms are most often repaired concurrently (open or endovascular); thus, distinguishing the outcomes of the iliac aneurysm repair from the aortic repair is usually not possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Evidence of the safety and effectiveness of endovascular iliac artery aneurysm repair is derived primarily from observational studies of isolated iliac artery aneurysms, which are less common.</p><p>A handful of small observational studies in patients with isolated iliac artery aneurysm suggest that endovascular repair is associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (1 versus 5 to 10 days), decreased operative time, less blood loss, and decreased need for perioperative transfusion (6 versus 47 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. There appears to be a higher rate of secondary interventions to maintain stent-graft patency, but long-term iliac artery patency with endovascular repair has not differed significantly from that of open iliac artery aneurysm repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In one longer-term study, five-year primary iliac artery patency rates were 96 percent for endovascular repair and 100 percent for open repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Mortality rates may be lower in patients undergoing endovascular repair for ruptured iliac aneurysm compared with open iliac aneurysm repair; however, open surgery is more often chosen for the repair of ruptured iliac artery aneurysm due to hemodynamic instability of the patient. Similar to endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, outcomes are biased in favor of endovascular repair. As an example, in a review of 71 patients with iliac aneurysm, 19 patients were treated with open repair and 52 were treated with endovascular repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There were no deaths in either group for patients who underwent elective iliac aneurysm repair. Seven of the patients presented with rupture, constituting 21 percent of the open group and 6 percent of the endovascular group; the mortality rate was 50 percent in the open group and 33 percent in the endovascular group.</p><p>Open repair may be preferred if preserving the internal iliac artery is critical to pelvic flow given that maintaining flow in the internal iliac artery using the available endovascular devices continues to present technical challenges. (See <a href=\"#H519609340\" class=\"local\">'Branched grafts'</a> below.)</p><p>Open repair may also be superior for decompressing the aneurysm sac and relieving symptoms of compression related to large iliac artery aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In addition, many patients have a history of smoking. Prior to endovascular or open surgical repair of iliac aneurysm, patients should undergo risk stratification and preventive strategies should be implemented to reduce perioperative cardiac and pulmonary complications.

A midline or retroperitoneal approach can be used; the choice depends largely upon the location of proximal vascular control. Aortic control requires laparotomy or a retroperitoneal approach. Control of the iliac arteries in the pelvis can be achieved through a low abdominal or retroperitoneal (transplant) incision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;, section on 'Midline incision'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery#H3294621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;, section on 'Oblique incisions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H451880924\"><span class=\"h2\">Common iliac artery aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms or patients with coexistent AAA are managed with aorto-bi-iliac or aorto-bifemoral graft placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Even in the absence of AAA, the origin of the graft in patients with bilateral iliac artery aneurysms should be just below the renal arteries, as if AAA were present, due to the increased risk of future aneurysmal aortic wall degeneration. The general technique for bifurcated graft placement is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Large common iliac artery aneurysms associated with compressive symptoms should be opened and repaired directly (endoaneurysmorrhaphy) to decompress the aneurysm sac rather than performing ligation and bypass. Interposition grafting of the common iliac artery is performed similar to open aortic aneurysm repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Direct open repair of the common iliac artery also maintains collateral flow to the pelvis via the lumbar arteries and the inferior mesenteric artery, thus reducing the risk of postoperative colonic ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Once the vessel is opened, retrograde bleeding is oversewn from the interior of the vessel and the graft sutured into place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Resection of the aneurysm sac is not necessary, as it only increases the risk of bleeding and injury to adjacent structures, particularly the ureter, which can be adherent to the wall of the aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Isolated common iliac artery aneurysms can be repaired without necessarily exposing and clamping the aorta, provided the proximal common iliac artery has minimal calcification, has normal diameter, and can otherwise be safely exposed and clamped. Avoiding aortic dissection and clamping also eliminates ischemia to the contralateral lower extremity, reduces the risk of cardiac and pulmonary complications, and shortens the recovery period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a retrospective review of 34 patients with isolated iliac artery aneurysms, none of the 32 patients who underwent open repair required aortic clamping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Interposition grafting maintains antegrade pelvic flow and should be used in the setting of bilateral IAAs when one side will require ligation. Aneurysmectomy may be necessary for a large aneurysm that is causing compressive symptoms.</p><p>Ligation has the advantage of limited pelvic dissection; however, despite proximal and distal internal iliac artery (IIA) ligation, the aneurysm sac may fail to decompress due to retrograde filling through collateral branches. Each of the IAA branch vessels must be individually ligated to eliminate the back-bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Factors that influence the choice of repair include the segment of the iliac tree that is affected (common, internal, or external iliac artery), coexistent abdominal aortic aneurysm, the length of normal artery proximal and distal to the aneurysm, involvement of the internal iliac artery, bilateral versus unilateral aneurysms, patient comorbidities, and resources available at the treating center.

Embolization of the internal iliac artery may become necessary if the distal landing zone is inadequate. Alternatively, a direct open approach can be used. Internal iliac artery aneurysms can be embolized, ligated, or directly repaired. (See <a href=\"#H451880945\" class=\"local\">'Endovascular repair'</a> above and <a href=\"#H451880915\" class=\"local\">'Open surgical repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For elective repair of iliac artery aneurysm in patients with suitable aortoiliac anatomy, we suggest endovascular repair rather than open surgical repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Although primary iliac artery patency rates are not significantly different between open and endovascular repair, endovascular repair is associated with significantly decreased morbidity, an important advantage given that these patients are older and frequently have important comorbidities.

Open repair is often necessary for hemodynamically unstable patients with iliac artery aneurysm rupture, and open repair may be superior for relieving symptoms of compression related to large iliac artery aneurysms.

Interruption of unilateral or bilateral internal iliac arteries should be undertaken only after careful consideration of the risks. Unilateral internal iliac artery embolization may be warranted in selected patients after acknowledging the risk of side effects such as buttock claudication and sexual dysfunction.
