The preoccupation with perceived flaws leads to repetitive behaviors (eg, checking their appearance in mirrors), which are difficult to control and not pleasurable. BDD is common but usually under-recognized, causes distress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired functioning, and is often associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. </p><p>Patients with BDD may present to mental health professionals as well as other clinicians, such as dermatologists, plastic surgeons, primary care physicians, pediatricians, and dentists. Most patients seek nonpsychiatric treatment (most commonly dermatologic and surgical) for their perceived physical defects; this treatment appears to be ineffective for most patients and can be risky for clinicians to provide. By contrast, pharmacotherapy (ie, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cognitive-behavioral therapy tailored specifically to BDD are often efficacious. </p><p>This topic reviews the treatment and prognosis of BDD. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of BDD are discussed separately.

Most patients have little to no insight regarding their appearance and may doubt whether psychiatric treatment can help them. In addition, some find it difficult to leave their house to see clinicians.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Educate patients about BDD &ndash;</strong> Patients benefit from education about BDD and a rationale for recommended treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Although many patients are relieved to learn that they have a known and treatable disorder, some may resist the diagnosis. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Focus on the patient&rsquo;s suffering and impaired functioning </strong>&ndash; Emphasize how the concerns with appearance are causing the patient to suffer and are interfering with functioning, and that recommended treatment can improve these problems. Motivational interviewing modified for BDD may help to engage reluctant patients in treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-psychotherapies#H432862274\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of psychotherapies&quot;, section on 'Motivational interviewing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It usually is not helpful to comment on the patient&rsquo;s looks. Even reassuring comments are often misinterpreted in a negative way. We do not try to convince patients that they look normal (one cannot impose insight), nor do we agree with them that there is something wrong with their appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Instead, clinicians might say that patients with BDD see themselves very negatively and differently from how other people see them, for reasons that are not well understood (the tendency to over-focus on details of appearance could be mentioned). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features#H62823957\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body dysmorphic disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Educate patients about effective psychiatric treatments for BDD</strong> &ndash; Patients can benefit from education about cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) and pharmacotherapy, especially misconceptions that surround these treatments. If patients fear that CBT will be too anxiety-provoking, clinicians can reassure patients that CBT exercises will be generated collaboratively by the patient and clinician, and that patients will not be asked to perform CBT exercises that are intolerable. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It may also be helpful to emphasize that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are usually well tolerated, not addictive, and appear to normalize brain functioning (rather than cause brain damage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Clinicians can manage negative expectations about medications by [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Explaining the desired therapeutic effects (eg, &ldquo;Response to just one trial of these types of medication occurs in one-half to more than two-thirds of patients&rdquo;) when discussing potential side effects. Response rates are even higher in patients who complete the medication trial. If the first medication that&rsquo;s tried is not adequately helpful, other medications may be effective. It may be helpful to elicit benefits that are meaningful and specific to the patient. Explain that it may take time (eg, one to three months) for the benefits to manifest. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ensuring that patients understand that many side effects are transient and benign. In addition, side effects can be reframed as an indication that the medication is having an effect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Discussing techniques for coping with side effects other than stopping the drug. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The US Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s warnings about suicidal ideation and behavior in young adults and children who are treated with SSRIs must be acknowledged. However, studies indicate that in adults with BDD, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> protects against worsening of suicidality more than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and that suicidality decreases with other SSRIs. In addition, other studies indicate that SSRIs decrease suicidal ideation and behavior in depressed adults, and that the risk of suicidality in depressed children and adolescents is comparable for fluoxetine and placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, it appears that the substantial risk of suicidal ideation and behavior posed by BDD and comorbid depression exceeds the small potential risk posed by the use of SSRIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-adults#H22905840\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of antidepressants on suicide risk in adults&quot;, section on 'Reduction of existing suicidal ideation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of antidepressants on suicide risk in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Randomized trials'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Individualized treatment</strong> &ndash; Treatment for BDD should be individualized for each patient. Factors to consider include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severity of illness. (See <a href=\"#H105999546\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate illness'</a> below and <a href=\"#H105999508\" class=\"local\">'Severe illness'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of prior treatment for BDD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Comorbid disorders &ndash; Although some comorbid disorders such as unipolar major depression or social anxiety disorder may respond to the same medication used for BDD, other comorbid disorders (eg, bipolar disorder) require different medications. In addition, patients with comorbid substance use disorders are generally not treated with benzodiazepines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medication safety and adverse effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patient preferences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pregnancy status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>If relevant, discuss the likelihood that cosmetic treatment won&rsquo;t help</strong>. (See <a href=\"#H91393837\" class=\"local\">'Cosmetic interventions'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features#H281269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body dysmorphic disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Cosmetic interventions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Involve family members </strong>&ndash; We suggest involving the family if it is appropriate and potentially helpful. Family members often bring patients with BDD for treatment, and can support the patient and encourage adherence with the treatment plan. In addition, family members generally benefit from psychoeducation about the illness and its treatment. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282126\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the beginning of treatment, ill outpatients who are receiving medication are generally seen once every few weeks, and patients receiving CBT are seen weekly or more often. The visit frequency also depends upon clinical urgency. In patients who improve with medication, the frequency of visits can be tapered, with visits every one to two months. Stable remitted patients can eventually be seen once every three to six months. Patients who receive CBT are usually seen at least weekly for approximately six months; following improvement, as-needed &ldquo;booster sessions&rdquo; may be helpful to maintain gains made during weekly treatment.</p><p>We suggest monitoring BDD symptoms at every visit by asking them:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the total time each day that you think about your appearance?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much distress is caused by these thoughts about your appearance?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much do the concerns about your appearance interfere with daily functioning (eg, work, school, and social)?</p><p/><p>In addition, depressive symptoms and suicidal thinking and behavior should be monitored. We suggest monitoring depression with the self-report Patient Health Questionnaire &ndash; Nine Item (PHQ-9) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">form 1</a>), which is the standard among the many available scales. Depression is highly comorbid with BDD. Information about comorbid psychopathology in BDD and the use of the PHQ-9 to assess depression is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features#H281998\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body dysmorphic disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Comorbidity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=using-scales-to-monitor-symptoms-and-treat-depression-measurement-based-care#H100014092\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Using scales to monitor symptoms and treat depression (measurement based care)&quot;, section on 'Patient Health Questionnaire - Nine Item'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91393837\"><span class=\"h2\">Cosmetic interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with BDD, we suggest that clinicians not perform surgical, dermatological, or other cosmetic treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Although most patients with BDD receive cosmetic treatment in an attempt to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; their perceived appearance flaws, BDD symptoms respond poorly to cosmetic procedures in the large majority of cases and may even worsen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, dissatisfaction with the outcome of cosmetic treatment may lead patients to become litigious, threatening, or violent toward clinicians. </p><p>We suggest that patients presenting for cosmetic treatment be assessed for BDD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F96647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96647 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition to inquiring about BDD&rsquo;s diagnostic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F96646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96646 \">table 1</a>), it can be helpful to assess patient motivations and expectations for cosmetic treatment; determine whether patients have had past cosmetic treatment with which they have been dissatisfied; ask whether surgeons, dermatologists, dentists, or other clinicians have recommended against cosmetic treatment; and observe the patient&rsquo;s behavior in the office (eg, making unusual requests for appointment times so as to avoid being seen by other people). </p><p>If BDD is suspected in patients presenting for cosmetic treatment, we suggest: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Explaining to the patient that they may or do have BDD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Educating patients about BDD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conveying concern that cosmetic treatment appears unlikely to be helpful</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discussing the potential for pharmacotherapy (eg, SSRIs) and CBT to improve BDD symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referring the patient to a mental health clinician who is knowledgeable about BDD</p><p/><p>If the patient insists upon receiving cosmetic treatment, the clinician can recommend delaying it until after the patient has tried psychiatric treatment. However, some patients receive cosmetic treatment regardless of the clinician&rsquo;s recommendations, in which case efforts should be made to have the patient receive mental health treatment concurrently.</p><p>Additional information about the prognosis and course of illness of BDD following cosmetic procedures is discussed separately.

Although primary care clinicians may be able to treat mild BDD (eg, mild distress and no suicidal ideation or behavior), most patients are referred for management, especially those who require psychotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105999546\"><span class=\"h1\">MILD TO MODERATE ILLNESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild to moderate body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by the following clinical features: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No suicidal intent or self-harming behaviors are present. In addition, there is no suicidal ideation, or if suicidal thoughts are present, they do not pose an imminent risk. Suicidal ideation that does not represent an imminent risk includes passive suicidal ideation, such as thoughts that life is not worth living or that family members would be better off if the patient was dead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No more than mild to moderate comorbid depressive symptoms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impairment of psychosocial functioning (eg, avoiding certain social situations) attributable to BDD symptoms is no more than mild to moderate.</p><p/><p>Mild to moderate BDD can generally be treated in an outpatient setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2010401366\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that acute treatment of mild to moderate BDD proceed according to the sequence described in the sections below. Patients begin with initial treatment and progress through each step until they respond. The duration of an adequate treatment trial with pharmacotherapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H227063003\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> below and <a href=\"#H105999905\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The primary treatments that are suggested for BDD, either as monotherapy or combination therapy, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antidepressant drugs (ie, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CBT tailored to BDD </p><p/><p>Following response to acute treatment, patients receive maintenance treatment to prevent recurrences.

However, a reasonable alternative is pharmacotherapy plus CBT. </p><p>Randomized trials have found that pharmacotherapy or CBT is each efficacious, and no head-to-head trials have compared pharmacotherapy with CBT. Medications are usually more available than CBT, and the drugs that are used for BDD can also treat some comorbidities such as unipolar major depression, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and panic disorder. Other factors to consider in choosing a treatment regimen include patient preference, prior treatment history, medication safety and side effects, likelihood that the patient will fully participate in and adhere to the recommended treatment, and availability of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The use of pharmacotherapy or CBT is consistent with treatment guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and the results from systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105999898\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First line pharmacotherapy for BDD consists of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), based upon a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We often choose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, but other SSRIs are suitable as first line treatment. No head-to-head trials have compared different SSRIs with each other, and there is no compelling reason to think that one SSRI is more efficacious than another. We typically do not use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a> because the US Food and Drug Administration dosing limit is now too low to usually effectively treat BDD; treatment of BDD with SSRIs often requires high doses, and there are concerns about the cardiac side effects of citalopram at higher doses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects#H4145433\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;, section on 'Citalopram'</a>.) &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p>The tricyclic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a> is a reasonable alternative to SSRIs, based upon the efficacy of clomipramine in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, clomipramine is generally reserved for use when SSRIs have not been helpful, because tolerability is usually better with SSRIs than tricyclics. No head-to-head trials have compared SSRIs with clomipramine. The use and efficacy of clomipramine for BDD is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H140366129\" class=\"local\">'Treatment refractory patients'</a> below.)</p><p>SSRIs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a> often decrease the BDD symptoms of obsessional preoccupation, compulsive behaviors, distress, and functional impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Medications can also improve depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and behavior, anger and hostility, somatic symptoms, and mental health-related quality of life. In addition, the efficacy of monotherapy with SSRIs or clomipramine is comparable in patients with delusional BDD beliefs, as well as patients with nondelusional beliefs. &#160;</p><p>Evidence for the efficacy of SSRIs includes a 12-week randomized trial that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> (mean dose 78 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> at week 12) with placebo in 67 patients with BDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;30 percent) occurred in more patients treated with fluoxetine than placebo (53 versus 18 percent), and functional improvement was greater with fluoxetine. The benefit of fluoxetine was independent of the presence of psychiatric comorbidity (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or personality disorder), and was comparable for patients with delusional BDD beliefs and those with nondelusional BDD beliefs.

Although the techniques and elements of CBT for BDD overlap with those that are used for other psychiatric disorders, BDD differs from other disorders in important ways and thus needs a somewhat different CBT approach. Two empirically based treatment manuals are available for therapists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p>The number and frequency of individual CBT sessions in different studies has varied substantially, from 12 weekly hour-long sessions to 12 weeks of daily 90-minute sessions.

The first three to four sessions are spent setting the groundwork for therapy. This includes gaining an understanding of the patient&rsquo;s BDD symptoms and other psychopathology, providing psychoeducation about BDD, and developing an individualized cognitive behavioral model of the patient&rsquo;s illness, including hypothesized mechanisms that cause <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maintain the BDD symptoms. This model is used to create a treatment plan and helps the patient understand how CBT may be beneficial. It is important to incorporate the patient's values and goals into the treatment.</p><p>Another component of the introductory sessions is motivational interviewing to address patient ambivalence about participating in treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Clinicians attempt to motivate patients to change their thoughts and behaviors by expressing empathy with patients, eliciting both their reasons to change and ambivalence about change, not arguing with patients about their ambivalence, helping patients develop an awareness of the discrepancy between their present situation and what they desire, and setting treatment goals regarding valued life activities (eg, developing relationships or advancing one&rsquo;s career). Motivational interviewing may be needed after the introductory sessions to retain patients in treatment and enhance adherence. </p><p>After laying the groundwork, treatment focuses upon the core elements of CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In most studies, the elements included cognitive restructuring, exposure (eg, to avoided social situations) in combination with behavioral experiments, prevention of <span class=\"nowrap\">rituals/repetitive</span> behaviors (eg, mirror checking), perceptual retraining when looking in a mirror (a five-minute exercise that helps patients see themselves holistically and nonjudgmentally; it does not involve staring in the mirror), advanced cognitive strategies that target core beliefs (eg, &ldquo;I am worthless&rdquo;), and relapse prevention. During exposures, CBT incorporates behavioral experiments in which patients test their maladaptive beliefs (eg, &ldquo;My nose is huge, and at least 70 percent of the people I see in the store will stare at me for at least five seconds because I look so bad&rdquo;). Behavioral experiments are incorporated into exposures because many patients have little to no insight, and exposure without behavioral experiments may be insufficient. Advanced cognitive strategies identify and modify deeply held beliefs (eg, &ldquo;I am worthless, and no one will ever love me&rdquo;).</p><p>Treatment strategies often used in addition to the core elements include <span class=\"nowrap\">mindfulness/perceptual</span> retraining with mirrors, habit reversal (behavioral therapy for reducing BDD-related skin picking or hair plucking), and a focus upon depressive symptoms if needed. If patients are receiving or contemplating cosmetic treatment for BDD, this also needs to be addressed. </p><p>Therapists need to encourage patients to do CBT exercises while not pushing patients so hard that they drop out of treatment. Exposure exercises are usually done gradually, with use of an exposure hierarchy that the patient and therapist develop together. Cognitive restructuring skills are usually learned before exposure, as use of cognitive skills during exposure may make exposures more tolerable.</p><p>The final sessions are devoted to relapse prevention. This includes reviewing the patient&rsquo;s progress and identifying ongoing problems; reinforcing the most helpful CBT components; anticipating future stressful situations and planning responses; teaching patients to identify and monitor subsyndromal symptoms, differentiating &ldquo;slips&rdquo; or lapses (recurrence of BDD symptoms) from full-blown relapses of the disorder; discussing risk factors for relapse; and developing a plan that patients will follow if problems occur, including the possibility of resuming treatment. </p><p>After treatment ends, it is important that patients continue to practice CBT skills in order to decrease the risk of relapse. In addition, patients may benefit from occasional (eg, once every two months) booster sessions with therapists to help maintain acquired skills or manage recurrent symptoms.</p><p>Evidence supporting the use of CBT for patients who are acutely ill with BDD includes randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 12-week trial compared CBT (targeting BDD cognitions and behaviors) with anxiety management (targeting appearance related anxiety) in 46 acutely ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Both treatments were administered in weekly individual sessions that lasted one hour and included homework between sessions; nearly half of the patients were on stable doses of SSRIs. Response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;30 percent) occurred in more patients who received CBT than anxiety management (48 versus 12 percent). Improvement with CBT was comparable for patients with and without delusional BDD beliefs, and for patients with and without comorbid depression.

At week 12, response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;30 percent) occurred in more patients who received CBT than no treatment (50 versus 12 percent). However, improvement of depression, insight, and functioning were comparable. BDD symptom severity, as well as insight and functioning, continued to improve with 12 additional weeks of CBT treatment; after six months of treatment, 81 percent of all participants (immediate CBT plus waitlisted patients subsequently treated with CBT) met responder criteria.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H140366108\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment resistant patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BDD may not respond satisfactorily to initial treatment with an SSRI or CBT specifically tailored for BDD. In this case, it is important to ask how often the patient misses taking their medication, because nonadherence is common during treatment of psychiatric disorders. Similarly, it is important to ask about adherence with CBT homework. Improving adherence with pharmacotherapy or CBT homework can convert nonresponders to responders. In addition, many patients with BDD have significant life stressors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> comorbid psychopathology (eg, unipolar major depression, social anxiety disorder, or a personality disorder). If a stressor or disorder other than BDD is more salient than BDD, treatment should refocus upon the primary problem. The comorbidity of BDD is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features#H281998\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body dysmorphic disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Comorbidity'</a>.)</p><p>Next step treatment depends upon the initial treatment strategy and the degree to which the initial treatment is beneficial and tolerable:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who obtain little symptom relief (eg, reduction of baseline symptoms &lt;20 percent) from an SSRI, the clinician should ascertain that medication adherence was good and that a high enough dose was tried.

If a high enough dose has been tried, or if the medication was poorly tolerated, we suggest discontinuing the SSRI and administering one or more trials with other SSRIs (ie, monotherapy with a new SSRI). We generally do not use clomipramine and other serotonergic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>) until multiple SSRIs have been tried. The evidence supporting the use of SSRIs and the process for switching patients from one SSRI to another are discussed separately.

In addition, augmentation has the advantage of maintaining other gains that might have occurred with the initial drug, such as improvement in depressive symptoms or suicidality. Augmentation options include the following. The relative efficacy of these augmentation approaches has not been studied; however, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buspirone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buspirone</a> is often a good initial choice because preliminary efficacy data are promising and it is usually well tolerated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=buspirone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Buspirone</a> &ndash; A retrospective study of 36 patients found that response to buspirone occurred in 12 (33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

However, this medication combination should be used cautiously with close monitoring of clomipramine levels and electrocardiograms, because SSRIs may increase serum concentrations of clomipramine, which has a low therapeutic index. In addition, patients treated with an SSRI plus clomipramine may be at increased risk for serotonin syndrome.

Patients were initially assigned to a study drug for 8 weeks and then crossed over to the other drug for 8 weeks, with the order determined randomly. Improvement of symptoms was greater during treatment with clomipramine than desipramine, both at week 8 and week 16. In addition, improvement of functioning was greater with clomipramine. Clomipramine was equally effective in patients with delusional BDD beliefs and in patients with nondelusional BDD beliefs, and it was equally effective for patients with and without comorbid psychopathology (eg, depression). Side effects for the two treatments were comparable. The use of desipramine controlled for the nonspecific anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of clomipramine, and thus served to demonstrate clomipramine&rsquo;s specific efficacy for BDD symptoms.</p><p>If patients obtain little symptom relief (eg, reduction of baseline symptoms &lt;20 percent) from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>, we suggest discontinuing the drug and switching to&nbsp;an SSRI that was not previously prescribed.
