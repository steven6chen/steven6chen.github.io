Others regularly use suction needles because, in general, they produce large specimens. Cutting needles, with the exception of the spring-loaded variety, require a relatively longer time in the liver during the biopsy, a factor that may influence the risk of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although not consistent, a greater risk of bleeding following a biopsy has been observed with larger-diameter needles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If cirrhosis is clinically suspected, a cutting needle is preferred over a suction-type needle, as fibrotic tissue tends to be fragmented with the latter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Description of procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the patient in the supine position and right hand under the head, the point of maximum liver dullness (in both inspiratory and expiratory phases) is percussed over the right hemithorax at the mid-axillary line. The point of maximum liver dullness is usually between the sixth and ninth (usually eighth) intercostal spaces, and the site is marked. We then perform a bedside ultrasound to confirm the appropriateness of the biopsy site. If the point of maximum liver dullness is uncertain, ultrasound guidance is mandatory. Some operators use a 22 to 25 gauge spinal needle to help determine the depth that the needle needs to penetrate through the diaphragm before reaching the hepatic capsule.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lidocaine</a> (2 to 4 mL of a 2 percent solution) is injected over the upper border of the rib to avoid the intercostal vessels that traverse along the lower border of each rib. A small scalpel incision is made. </p><p>If a spring-loaded or automated needle is being used, the device is passed through the skin incision and the biopsy specimen is obtained with the patient holding <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> breath transiently in quiet, not forced, expiration phase. </p><p>If a biopsy needle that requires a suction technique is used, it is first attached to a 10 or 20 mL syringe containing 5 to 10 mL of sterile saline. A trocar can be used to create the tract. The biopsy needle is then passed through the incision until it reaches the peritoneal cavity. A small amount of saline is flushed into the peritoneal cavity to eliminate any fat tissue that may have entered the needle during the passage. With the patient holding <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> breath transiently in quiet, not forced, expiration phase, suction is applied and the biopsy is performed, minimizing the time the needle is within the liver. A similar approach without saline flushing applies to cutting needles (eg, Trucut needle).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of image guidance for nontargeted biopsies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most practitioners obtain liver imaging within one week prior to a non-targeted liver biopsy (ie, a liver biopsy that is not of a specific liver lesion, but is a representative sample of liver parenchyma). Ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) identifies mass lesions and defines the anatomy of the liver and the relative positions of the gallbladder, lung, and kidney. </p><p>For non-targeted biopsies, the use of ultrasound marking prior to percutaneous biopsy is mandatory when adequate localization by percussion cannot be achieved. Ultrasound guidance can also be helpful for less experienced operators and in patients who are obese, have a history of prior upper abdominal surgery, or those who are suspected of having advanced cirrhosis with possible atrophy of the right lobe of the liver based upon clinical or laboratory grounds.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.aasld.org/sites/default/files/guideline_documents/LiverBiopsy2009.pdf&amp;token=huD16WNiqax4AlMaXQpeDvRXHZQ57FW5tC6jRF62ndLp65cGWkXbCAzsxxz4ErqKrrWYoP5QRDmavvizc+k0n8WvrXXLuHOXLNTkOMLgTF+yGqpkM6n/JgBCRyVjN0DH&amp;TOPIC_ID=3587\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guideline</a> issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends ultrasound marking before biopsy because of the potential to reduce complications, but does not consider it to be mandatory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67820 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In a study of 165 consecutive outpatient liver biopsies, ultrasound imaging resulted in changing the biopsy site in 21 of 165 patients (13 percent) and led to abortion of the procedure in four patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Sixty percent of complications occur within two hours of the procedure, and in two studies including 6000 to 68,000 patients, 83 to 96 percent of complications occurred within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>]. Approximately 2 to 3 percent of patients require hospital admission for management of complications; pain or hypotension are the predominant causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p>The risk of mortality appears to be higher in patients who undergo a biopsy of a malignant lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other factors associated with complications include more than two biopsy passes, platelet count &le;50,000 per microliter, and female sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Operator experience affected the risk of complications in some reports. In one study, a lower complication rate was observed when biopsies were performed by clinicians who did more than 50 biopsies a year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is the most common complication following percutaneous liver biopsy with approximately one-fourth of patients experiencing pain in the right upper quadrant or right shoulder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The pain is usually dull, worse with inspiration, mild, and resolves completely within a few hours. We manage post-biopsy pain in patients who are hemodynamically stable with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a>. </p><p>Persistent or moderate to severe pain or hemodynamic instability is uncommon, and these patients should be further evaluated with laboratory testing and imaging (ie, complete blood count, ultrasound, or abdominal computed tomography [CT]) to look for evidence of bleeding or peritonitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common serious complication of liver biopsy is intraperitoneal hemorrhage, although hematoma and hemobilia can also occur. The incidence of severe bleeding that results in hemodynamic compromise or requires intervention has been reported following 0.01 to 0.5 percent of liver biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/4,23,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23,29</a>]. In a study of over 6600 image-guided liver biopsies, the incidence of hematoma requiring transfusion or angiographic intervention was 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Bleeding usually becomes clinically apparent within three to four hours after the biopsy. Hypotension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tachycardia following a biopsy, particularly when associated with abdominal pain, are usually related to hemorrhage. </p><p>Three categories of bleeding have been recognized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intraperitoneal hemorrhage - </strong>Intraperitoneal hemorrhage, which may result from laceration caused by deep inspiration during the biopsy or may be related to penetrating injury of a branch of the hepatic artery or portal vein. It can be recognized by the presence of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity on imaging tests. However, the presence of small amounts of free fluid without other clinical features of bleeding may be clinically insignificant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with suspected intraperitoneal hemorrhage, immediate arrangements for blood, platelets, and plasma should be made and a surgeon and interventional radiologist should be alerted. Subsequent management depends upon the type of bleeding and the clinical course. The administration of intravenous fluids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood products may result in stabilization without the need for further intervention. Angiography with an attempt at embolization or surgical exploration is indicated if hemodynamic instability persists despite aggressive resuscitative measures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hematoma - </strong>Small intrahepatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subcapsular hematomas are usually asymptomatic, while large hematomas may cause pain, tachycardia, hypotension, or a delayed drop in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In one series, symptomatic, subcapsular hematomas were observed in only 3 of 12,750 biopsies (0.023 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A trial involving 51 patients who underwent biopsy with a suction needle technique found an overall incidence of 2.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Conservative treatment is usually sufficient. Angiography is rarely required to embolize an arteriovenous fistula.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemobilia - </strong>Hemobilia is the least common of the hemorrhagic complications. In a series of over 68,000 percutaneous liver biopsies, only four cases (0.006 percent) of hemobilia were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Hemobilia usually presents with the classical triad of gastrointestinal bleeding, biliary pain, and jaundice. The bleeding is usually arterial in origin, but can be venous in patients with pre-existing portal hypertension. It can vary in severity from occult to life-threatening hemorrhage. Hemobilia can present acutely after simultaneous perforation of intrahepatic bile ducts and blood vessels, or, more commonly, in a delayed fashion from gradual erosion of a biopsy-induced hematoma or pseudoaneurysm into a bile duct. The mean interval from the time of biopsy to the onset of symptoms is approximately five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hemobilia may resolve with supportive care, but ongoing or intermittent bleeding requires angiographic embolization or surgery.

It is almost always inconsequential, but septicemia and shock can rarely occur in patients with biliary obstruction and cholangitis. The routine use of prophylactic antibiotics has not been recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H57937219\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Complications of primary sclerosing cholangitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173921360\"><span class=\"h3\">Bile peritonitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bile peritonitis is a complication of liver biopsy, particularly in patients with mechanical obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary system. In other patients, it may indicate perforation of the gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Bile peritonitis should be suspected in patients who develop the abrupt onset of abdominal pain with peritoneal signs (typically within a few minutes of the biopsy), particularly when bile was aspirated through the biopsy needle. Symptoms range from mild to severe and may include fever, leukocytosis, ileus, and hemodynamic instability. For patients with suspected bile peritonitis, we obtain imaging with computed tomography scan. Treatment includes intravenous fluids, broad spectrum antibiotics, inpatient monitoring and surgical intervention in patients with clinical deterioration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Organ injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumothorax (incidence of approximately 0.0078 percent) and hemothorax (incidence of approximately 0.063 percent) often resolve spontaneously and seldom require intervention with a chest tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Inadvertent perforation of other abdominal organs is usually well tolerated and does not require specific intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823465359\"><span class=\"h3\">Other complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of malignant needle-track seeding is a potential complication in patients suspected of having a malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Solid liver lesions: Differential diagnosis and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other rare complications after percutaneous liver biopsy include subcutaneous emphysema, pneumoperitoneum, pneumoscrotum, subphrenic abscess, carcinoid crisis, anaphylaxis after biopsy of an echinococcal cyst, and pancreatitis due to hemobilia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3236417920\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limitations to liver biopsy include sampling variability and the subjective nature of the pathologist&rsquo;s interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Diagnostic accuracy of a liver biopsy may be affected by specimen size or by variable distribution of the disease throughout the liver parenchyma. In a study of 124 patients with chronic hepatitis C who underwent laparoscopic-guided liver biopsy, 41 patients (31 percent) had a difference by at least one histologic stage between right and left lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Liver fine-needle aspiration biopsy is contraindicated in patients with underlying coagulopathy or if a safe access route to the lesion cannot be identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H257828780\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Solid liver lesions: Differential diagnosis and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Fine needle biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3168818105\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall mortality related to fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the liver is low (0.008 to 0.031 percent). Bleeding is uncommon in patients without coagulopathy or a vascular lesion, such as a hemangioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Some studies suggest that seeding of the biopsy tract with malignant cells is rare (0.003 to 0.009 percent); a large review identified only three reported cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, this figure could be an underestimation because the studies were retrospective and based upon mailed questionnaires. A much higher rate of malignant biopsy tract seeding was described in a review that focused on 43 patients who had undergone a preoperative biopsy for suspected hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Evidence of dissemination related to the biopsy was observed in seven patients (16 percent).</p><p>The yield of cytological material obtained from fine-needle aspiration biopsy compares favorably with the final histologic diagnosis of surgical specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, negative cytology does not rule out malignancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59203445\"><span class=\"h1\">LAPAROSCOPIC LIVER BIOPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic liver biopsy is an alternative for patients with contraindications to percutaneous liver biopsy or who have other indications for laparoscopy. However, its use has declined in favor of less invasive radiological procedures. When used, the yield of diagnostic laparoscopy is high. In one review, a definitive diagnosis was obtained in 93 percent of 1794 diagnostic laparoscopies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-biopsy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].
