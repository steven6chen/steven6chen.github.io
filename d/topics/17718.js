Patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia present with rest pain, which is pain across the base of the metatarsal heads at rest relieved by dependency, or with tissue loss, which can be ulceration, dry gangrene, or wet gangrene occurring in the lower extremities due to atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the iliac, femoral, or popliteal arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Signs of chronic limb-threatening ischemia on noninvasive testing may include an ankle-brachial index less than 0.4, a flat waveform on pulse volume recording, and low or absent pedal flow on duplex ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; however, ischemia and limb threat are part of a spectrum, and less severe levels of hemodynamic impairment may contribute to delayed wound healing and increased amputation risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The different therapies for chronic limb-threatening ischemia will be reviewed here, according to the site of the vascular lesion and the specific clinical setting. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of this disorder and acute limb ischemia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic limb-threatening ischemia occurs in 1 to 2 percent of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) who are 50 years of age or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The natural history of chronic limb-threatening ischemia usually involves inexorable progression to amputation unless there is an intervention that results in the improvement of arterial perfusion. This is in contrast to the often benign natural history of mild and moderate claudication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC)/American</span> Heart Association (AHA) practice guidelines suggested the following distribution of outcomes at one year in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alive with two limbs &ndash; 50 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amputation &ndash; 25 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular mortality &ndash; 25 percent</p><p/><p>The guidelines also identified a number of factors that increase the rate of limb loss in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. These include factors that reduce microvascular flow (diabetes, severe renal failure or heart failure, smoking, prolonged cold exposure, Raynaud's phenomenon) and disorders that require increased microvascular flow (infection, such as cellulitis or osteomyelitis, and skin breakdown).</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines summarized the general principles of the treatment and prevention of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61050\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61050 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56143\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56143 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. These guidelines are consistent with recommendations made in the 2007 TASC II consensus document on the management of PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909632825\"><span class=\"h2\">TASC classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The guideline from the Inter-Society Consensus for the management of peripheral artery diseases (TASC II) presents a scheme that classifies arterial lesions as type A, B, C, or D based upon overall success rates of treating iliac, femoral, and popliteal lesions using endovascular or surgical means [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are no classifications referable to the tibial vessels. Type A lesions represent simple lesions while Type D lesions represent more complex lesions. Type B and Type C are intermediate lesions. Endovascular therapy is the treatment of choice for Type A lesions and is preferred for Type B lesions. Surgery is the treatment of choice for Type D lesions and is the preferred treatment for good-risk patients with Type C lesions. The details of the TASC classification are reviewed in detail elsewhere. These definitions are constantly evolving as a result of technological, pharmacological, and surgical advances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia#H909629056\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of acute and chronic lower extremity ischemia&quot;, section on 'TASC classification'</a>.)</p><p>Depending upon the characterization of a given lesion, a patient with chronic limb-threatening ischemia might benefit from a bypass-surgery-first or an angioplasty-first approach. The TASC classification, however, does not provide guidance for the treatment of tibial vessel disease and does not address multilevel disease, which is typical for patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. </p><p>Surgical bypass has been the gold standard for revascularization in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. However, increasing interest for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) came from a trial that showed no significant difference in outcomes between PTA and bypass surgery after a median of four years in a group that included patients with rest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Bypass surgery first versus angioplasty first</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bypass versus angioplasty in severe ischemia of the leg (BASIL) trial was designed to determine whether patients with severe limb ischemia due to infrainguinal disease would benefit from a surgery-first versus angioplasty-first approach. </p><p>The BASIL trial randomly assigned 450 patients with severe limb ischemia (rest pain, ulceration, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gangrene) due to infrainguinal disease amenable to either procedure to bypass surgery first or angioplasty first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The patient population was highly selected, and several thousand patients were screened to obtain the final group for randomization. Patients were required to be equally suitable for either procedure. As a result, the significant improvements in endpoints identified in this study cannot be generalized to all patients with severe limb ischemia. </p><p>The primary endpoints in this trial were overall survival and amputation-free survival. Following the initial randomization, additional procedures were allowed. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 224 patients assigned to PTA, 217 underwent the procedure, immediate technical failure occurring in 43 (20 percent). Among 228 assigned to bypass surgery, 196 underwent the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On intention-to-treat analysis, there was no difference in amputation-free survival at one year (54 versus 52 percent, respectively) or at the end of follow-up (38 versus 37 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At 30 days, there was no difference in overall survival between the two groups, but surgery was associated with significantly increased morbidity (57 versus 41 percent). Overall survival (47 versus 41 percent) was also similar at the end of a mean follow-up of 3.7 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients surviving at two years from randomization, bypass surgery first was associated with decreased subsequent mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.50-0.75).</p><p/><p>Based upon the strength of these results, the updated <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines for the management of peripheral artery disease recommend the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have an estimated life expectancy of two years or less, or those who do not have autogenous vein available as a conduit, balloon angioplasty is reasonable as the initial procedure, in selected patients, to improve distal blood flow. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with an estimated life expectancy of more than two years, and who have available autogenous vein conduit, a bypass surgery is reasonable to perform as the initial treatment to improve distal blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombolytic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheter-based intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy is an alternative to surgery or percutaneous intervention in the management of acute thrombosis superimposed on chronic stenosis or occlusion in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. The role of thrombolytic therapy in such patients is discussed separately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H529225541\"><span class=\"h1\">PERCUTANEOUS INTERVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous intervention (angioplasty, stent) is a less invasive alternative to surgery in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia.</p><p>The BASIL trial discussed above found less short-term morbidity with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty compared with surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Long-term outcomes, however, appear to favor a bypass-surgery-first approach. As a result, the American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC)/American</span> Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) be offered first to patients with significant comorbidities who are not expected to live more than one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. For patients expected to live longer than two years and who are good surgical candidates with adequate autogenous vein, the reduced intervention rate and possible improved durability with bypass surgery could outweigh the short-term increase in morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Bypass surgery first versus angioplasty first'</a> above.)</p><p>Among patients with both inflow (aortoiliac) and outflow (infrainguinal) disease, the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines recommend that significant inflow lesions be addressed first, whether surgery or percutaneous intervention is performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61050\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61050 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. After this has been accomplished, revascularization of outflow disease is warranted if there is persistent infection or symptoms. If the hemodynamic significance of the inflow disease is unclear, intra-arterial pressure measurements should be obtained across suprainguinal lesions before and after the administration of a vasodilator.</p><p>Subintimal recanalization, also called percutaneous intentional extraluminal and subintimal angioplasty, is a technique for managing chronic occlusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. An early large series described 200 consecutive femoropopliteal occlusions treated with subintimal recanalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The procedure was technically successful in 159 (80 percent). Among the successful procedures, the mean ankle-brachial index improved from 0.61 to 0.90, and the new perfusion channel remained hemodynamically patent in 71 and 58 percent at 12 and 36 months, respectively.</p><p>In another report, 39 patients with arterial occlusions, including 25 with gangrene and 14 with claudication or rest pain, underwent subintimal recanalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Technical success was achieved in 34 (87 percent); all five failed procedures were due to inability to reenter the true lumen distally. Claudication or rest pain resolved in all 14 patients with these symptoms, and gangrene healed in 21 of 25 cases. The cumulative patency rate among patients with successful procedures was 74 percent at 12 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY FOR INFLOW DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aortoiliac disease is also called inflow disease.

The perioperative mortality rates are well under 5 percent.</p><p>Most procedures are performed for severe claudication, but approximately 30 to 40 percent are done for limb salvage. Early studies revealed an overall patency rate in all patients of approximately 88 percent at five years and 75 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A subsequent series of 285 patients followed for 19 years (median duration of follow-up of 50 months) observed that the cumulative secondary graft patency was 96 and 94.4 percent at 5 and 10 years, respectively; the amputation rate was 4.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Another study of 1000 consecutive cases of aortofemoral bypass revealed that an important determinant of long-term patency was the initial severity of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The 5- and 10-year patency rates were higher in patients with rest pain than in those with gangrene or tissue loss (78 versus 63 percent and 63 versus 49 percent, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909633631\"><span class=\"h3\">In situ autogenous reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of an autogenous femoral vein that usually can be fashioned to be of appropriate length and diameter is an option when there is infection of a previously placed graft and the patient is unable to undergo extra-anatomic revascularization for technical reasons. Sequelae from venous harvest have been surprisingly minimal and the reconstructions durable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Extra-anatomic reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are circumstances in which standard aortobifemoral bypass grafting is not ideal, usually because of a high operative risk or the presence of infection in the operative field precluding the use of prosthetic material in that location.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Axillobifemoral bypass graft</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Axillobifemoral bypass grafting offers a reasonable alternative in <strong>high-risk</strong> patients. Since neither the thoracic nor the abdominal cavity is violated when performing an axillofemoral graft, the procedure usually does not interfere with the patient's ability to breathe, cough, or take oral feedings. In addition, it is possible to perform this procedure under local anesthesia, which is particularly important in patients who are poor candidates for major surgery. Additionally, this option is useful in the setting of an infected field such as following the removal of an infected aortobifemoral bypass graft.</p><p>Cumulative graft patency of approximately 70 percent at five years has been obtained with this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These results are inferior to those for aortofemoral bypass. Thus, axillofemoral bypass grafting is usually reserved for high-risk patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia; it is not commonly performed for claudication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Femorofemoral bypass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Femoral bypass is a useful option in patients with unilateral iliac occlusive disease whose aorta and contralateral iliac artery are free of disease. Femorofemoral bypass can be performed under regional anesthesia, an important advantage in high-risk patients. Cumulative five-year patency rates of 70 to 80 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909633572\"><span class=\"h3\">Axillopopliteal bypass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Axillopopliteal bypass is generally used as a final attempt to prevent amputation. This procedure consists of a bypass from the axillary artery to the popliteal artery. It is typically performed when the usual options are not available because of groin infection with or without graft infection, extensive operative scarring, or extensive involvement of the iliac and femoral systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909633610\"><span class=\"h2\">Profundoplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Profundoplasty consists of endarterectomy of the origin and proximal portion of the deep femoral artery. It is most useful when combined with an inflow procedure such as an aortobifemoral bypass or axillofemoral bypass. On occasion, it is performed as an isolated procedure when there is no option for distal bypass. This typically follows graft failure, with a goal of limb salvage even though there is less than maximal improvement in limb perfusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimally invasive operative alternatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic techniques to minimize the invasiveness of aortobifemoral bypass grafting have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Femoropopliteal bypass grafts are categorized as either above-knee or below-knee as determined by the location of the distal graft to artery anastomosis.</p><p>In order to better categorize outcome data, the following terminology is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A graft is considered to have primary patency if there has been uninterrupted patency without a procedure being necessary or performed to deal with stenosis or disease progression in the graft itself or adjacent native vessel, such as transluminal dilatation or proximal or distal extension to the graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assisted patency refers to grafts that undergo a revision (such as balloon angioplasty or bypass of a stenosis) prior to actual thrombosis of the graft. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term secondary patency is used if the graft has become occluded but patency has been restored with thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or transluminal angioplasty, or if there are problems with the graft itself or one of its anastomoses that requires revision or reconstruction.</p><p/><p>A review of studies published since 1981 found that primary above-knee femoropopliteal graft patency is 84 and 69 percent at one and four years when reverse saphenous vein is the conduit, and 79 and 60 percent at one and four years when polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

There were no differences in primary (43 versus 45 percent) or secondary patency rates (68 percent) at five years between the two materials.

The cumulative assisted primary patency rates were similar among the three conduit types at two years (69, 70, and 81 percent, respectively). However, at five years, the patency rate was significantly higher with the saphenous vein (73 versus 53 and 39 percent for umbilical vein and PTFE, respectively).</p><p/><p>These findings have led to the recommendation that a saphenous vein graft is preferred for above-knee grafts. If a prosthetic bypass graft is used, the human umbilical vein should be considered before PTFE. The argument to preserve saphenous veins for possible coronary artery grafting does not appear justified, and many vascular surgeons prefer the use of autologous vein graft in any position.</p><p>Despite the good outcome from autologous vein grafts, late occlusion due to progressive disease of arteries on either side of the bypass or deterioration of the graft itself remains a concern. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal bypass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A distal bypass to the infrapopliteal vessels should be performed only in situations of lower extremity ischemia in which femoropopliteal bypass is not feasible or does not allow graft flow into patent runoff vessels. A review of studies of infrapopliteal grafting published since 1981 noted primary patency rates with reversed saphenous vein graft for all indications of 77 percent and 62 percent at one and four years, and secondary patency rates with PTFE of 68 percent and 48 percent at one and four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>When performed specifically for limb salvage, cumulative patency rates were higher for reversed saphenous vein grafts compared with PTFE in the femoropopliteal position (85 versus 68 percent at one year, and 82 versus 48 percent at four years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Thus, most surgeons avoid, if at all possible, prosthetic material for bypass of infrapopliteal arteries.</p><p>The most important factor in choosing an outflow vessel for the distal anastomosis of an infrapopliteal bypass is the overall quality of the vessel. If two vessels of excellent quality are available, the preference probably should go to the vessel with the greatest degree of direct continuity with the foot. If no other factors are involved, the generally accepted order of preference for the infrapopliteal anastomosis is the posterior tibial artery, the anterior tibial artery, and the peroneal artery. The peroneal artery may be less desirable because it is deeper and more difficult to expose and because it is not directly continuous with the pedal arteries, and therefore thought by some to produce an inferior result in the setting of foot gangrene.</p><p>However, the possible lower efficacy of peroneal artery grafts has been questioned. One retrospective study evaluated 118 infrainguinal vein grafts; there was no difference in hemodynamic parameters among grafts to the peroneal, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, or popliteal arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY AMPUTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients presenting with chronic limb-threatening ischemia can be offered a reasonable attempt at limb salvage.

The functional outcome following below-knee amputation is far better than that following amputation at the ankle.

Older adult patients with peripheral artery disease have a higher mortality than age-matched controls. On the other hand, older adult patients are also less able to function with a prosthesis, and limb salvage in a previously ambulatory individual may mean the difference between self-care, with a good quality of life and independence, and nursing home dependence with markedly increased costs. </p><p>In an attempt to address this issue, a retrospective study evaluated 88 patients over 80 years of age who underwent revascularization primarily for limb salvage and were then followed for a 10-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. An infrainguinal bypass was performed in 85 percent, while 15 percent had an extra-anatomic bypass (eg, axillobifemoral or femoral-femoral grafting).

Other studies have supported this point of view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>A later study that used United States Medicare data from 10,784 long-term nursing patients who underwent lower extremity revascularization (open or endovascular) sought to determine functional status trajectories, changes in ambulatory status, and survival after lower extremity revascularization in nursing home residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Approximately one-third of procedures were emergent. Among the 1672 who were ambulatory before surgery, 63 percent were nonambulatory or had died in the first year. Among the 7188 who were nonambulatory, 89 percent were nonambulatory or had died. There were no significant differences in the combined outcome of nonambulatory status or death when comparing open versus endovascular revascularization. </p><p>After multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with nonambulatory status or death were age older than 80 years (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.28; 95% CI 1.16-1.40), cognitive impairment (AHR 1.23; 95% CI 1.18-1.29), heart failure (AHR 1.16; 95% CI 1.11-1.22), renal failure (AHR 1.09; 95% CI 1.04-1.14), emergent surgery (AHR 1.29; 95% CI 1.23-1.35), nonambulatory status before surgery (AHR 1.88; 95% CI 1.78-1.99), and decline in activities of daily living before surgery (AHR 1.23; 95% CI 1.18-1.28). </p><p>Some may conclude from this study that in a nursing home population, revascularization should be viewed as palliative, rather than as a means to extend life or ambulatory function. Although a patient may technically not be ambulatory, the ability to pivot as a means to transfer out of bed can significantly impact a patient's quality of life. In addition, even older adult patients have strong biases with respect to efforts to attempt limb salvage versus primary amputation. As a database review, many details are unable to be fleshed out, and the patient outcomes in the absence of attempted revascularization are not known but are likely worse. The majority of patients treated in the study suffered from chronic limb-threatening ischemia and likely faced amputation (not without its own risks), if revascularization were withheld. Thus, as in most cases in medicine and surgery, the treatment plan needs to be individualized for each patient's particular vascular condition, comorbidities, and wishes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Revascularization in chronic kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A longstanding controversy in vascular surgery involves the treatment of chronic limb-threatening ischemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly those with diabetes.

The operative mortality rate was 11 percent, with a five-year primary graft patency of 74 percent and a limb salvage rate of 77 percent. The overall five-year survival was only 40 percent in the group as a whole and only 21 percent in diabetics who also had a lower limb salvage rate of 63 percent. No patient on dialysis survived beyond three years. Thus, despite the increased mortality, graft patency and limb salvage were similar to results obtained in patients with normal renal function.</p><p>A second series consisted of 53 patients with end-stage renal disease who underwent 69 distal arterial reconstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Similar conclusions were reached in another meta-analysis, which also found a benefit from anticoagulant therapy (OR 0.54), but it was not statistically significant because of the small numbers of patients available for analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>Oral anticoagulants may be better than antiplatelet agents for preventing vein graft occlusion, while the reverse may be true for prosthetic grafts. The following studies illustrate this point: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (80 mg daily) with oral anticoagulation (titrated to an international normalized ratio [INR] of 3 to 4.5) in 2690 patients who had undergone infrainguinal grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. After a mean follow-up of 21 months, the primary endpoint of graft occlusion was similar for the two therapies for all grafts; however, the risk of graft occlusion tended to be lower in patients with vein grafts on oral anticoagulants, and in patients with nonvenous grafts taking aspirin. There was no significant difference in the composite endpoint of vascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or amputation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another trial randomly assigned 831 patients with prosthetic or vein grafts to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (target INR 1.4 to 2.8) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (325 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or aspirin (325 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. No differences were seen in long-term patency rates for vein grafts or 8-mm prosthetic grafts, but there was a significantly increased patency rate for patients taking warfarin who had 6-mm prosthetic bypass grafts (71.4 versus 57.9 percent). However, there were significantly more deaths in the warfarin group (31.8 versus 23 percent) compared with the ASA group with more major hemorrhagic events occurring in those on warfarin. </p><p/><p>The use of dual antiplatelet therapy is speculated to improve lower extremity bypass patency based upon a beneficial effect seen in patients with acute coronary syndromes. A multicenter trial that randomized 851 patients to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> (75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (75 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> versus placebo plus aspirin found no differences in the incidence of graft occlusion, amputation, or death between the treatment groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, a preplanned subgroup analysis of patients who received prosthetic grafts (n = 253) found a significantly reduced risk of graft occlusion (0.63, 95% CI 0.42-0.93) and amputation (0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.96) in those treated with dual antiplatelet therapy compared with aspirin alone. The incidence of severe bleeding (2.7 versus 1.0 percent) was not significantly different between the groups, although significantly more episodes of bleeding were recorded in the clopidogrel group overall (15.8 versus 6.1 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519589661\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guideline on antithrombotic therapy for peripheral artery occlusive disease made the following recommendations for the use of antithrombotic agents in patients undergoing infrainguinal vascular surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> therapy (75 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> should begin preoperatively and continue indefinitely in all patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass or arterial reconstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin K antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) are not routinely recommended in patients undergoing infrainguinal arterial reconstruction or bypass, except in those at high risk of bypass occlusion and limb loss.</p><p/><p>We agree with major society guidelines that recommend long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> for all patients with atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease.

In contrast to the typically benign natural history of mild and moderate claudication, the natural history of chronic limb-threatening ischemia is one of progression, usually leading to the need for amputation unless an intervention resulting in improved arterial perfusion is undertaken. (See <a href=\"#H554865745\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with lower extremity chronic limb-threatening ischemia present with rest pain, which is pain across the base of the metatarsal heads at rest relieved by dependency, or with tissue loss, which can be ulceration, dry gangrene, or wet gangrene. An ankle-brachial index &lt;0.4, flat waveforms on pulse volume recording, and low or absent pedal flow on duplex ultrasonography are consistent with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with peripheral artery disease should be treated with antiplatelet agents to reduce their cardiovascular risk, and for patients who undergo infrainguinal bypass, to improve graft patency. Antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 75 to 325 mg) is effective at reducing the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular death in individuals with symptomatic atherosclerotic lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD), including those with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clopidogrel</a> is an alternative to aspirin in those who cannot take aspirin. Other risk factor reduction strategies include smoking cessation and controlling hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and blood sugar. (See <a href=\"#H909635263\" class=\"local\">'Risk factor reduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H519589654\" class=\"local\">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients presenting with chronic limb-threatening ischemia can be offered a reasonable attempt at limb salvage; however, primary amputation may be more appropriate for some patients. Factors that may indicate a need for primary amputation include sepsis, paresis of the extremity, uncorrectable flexion contracture, significant necrosis of weight-bearing parts of the foot in ambulatory patients, and limited life expectancy. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Primary amputation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are poor candidates for intervention because of comorbidities or unfavorable arterial anatomy but who do not wish to proceed with primary amputation can be managed with conservative therapy consisting of pain control, aggressive wound care, and pharmacologic therapies aimed at improving wound healing such as therapeutic angiogenesis and prostaglandin therapy. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Medical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending upon the characterization of a given lesion, a patient with chronic limb-threatening ischemia might benefit from a surgery-first or an angioplasty-first approach. Based upon overall success rates for treating aortoiliac, femoral and popliteal lesions using endovascular or surgical means, the TASC classification groups arterial lesions into those favoring endovascular therapy (Type A, Type B) and those favoring surgery (Type D, Type C). The TASC classification, however, does not provide guidance for the treatment of tibial vessel disease and does not address multilevel disease, which is typical for patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H909632825\" class=\"local\">'TASC classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with inflow (aortoiliac) and outflow (infrainguinal) disease, the American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC)/American</span> Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend that inflow lesions be addressed first (surgery or percutaneous intervention). Once this has been accomplished, infrainguinal revascularization is warranted for persistent infection, ischemic ulcers, or gangrene, and if the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) is &lt;0.8. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Surgery for inflow disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous intervention (angioplasty, stent) is a less invasive alternative to surgery in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. The bypass versus angioplasty in severe ischemia of the leg (BASIL) trial found less short-term morbidity with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty compared with surgery, but the long-term outcomes appeared to favor a surgery-first approach. As a result, the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines recommend that PTA be offered first to patients with significant comorbidities who are not expected to live more than one to two years. For patients expected to live longer than two years and who are good surgical candidates with adequate autogenous vein, the reduced intervention rate and durability of bypass surgery probably outweighs the short-term increase in morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H529225541\" class=\"local\">'Percutaneous intervention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When surgery is needed for infrapopliteal occlusive disease, autogenous vein as the bypass conduit is preferred. Ipsilateral or contralateral saphenous vein should be used preferentially, or if not available, arm vein (basilic vein, cephalic vein) can be used as an alternative. If the length of available vein is limited, alternative grafts can be effective, including splicing together more than one vein segment, use of composite grafts (vein and prosthetic), or use of prosthetic with a vein patch at the distal anastomosis. Antithrombotic therapy appears to decrease the risk of long-term graft thrombosis. Vitamin K antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) can be considered for patients at high risk for graft thrombosis but may provide more benefit for those with a vein bypass graft while dual antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>) may be more appropriate for high-risk patients with a prosthetic graft. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Surgery for infrainguinal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following revascularization, periodic clinical evaluations should note the regression of symptoms, wound healing progression, the presence of pulses, and measurement of the ABI, and for infrainguinal bypass, duplex imaging of the entire length of the graft to evaluate for graft stenosis. Vein graft stenosis develops in 20 to 30 percent of infrainguinal vein bypasses during the first year and can lead to graft failure. We prefer to examine grafts perioperatively and at six weeks postoperatively, then at three-month intervals for two years, and every six months thereafter. Grafts that are monitored and treated when a significant stenosis is identified have better long-term patency rates (82 to 93 percent versus 30 to 50 percent) compared with those that require thrombectomy and revision following a complete thrombosis.
