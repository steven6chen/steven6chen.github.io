It is typically diagnosed late in the course of patients with chronic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-advanced-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The patient's hepatic reserve, as indicated by the Child-Pugh classification, often dictates therapeutic options (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Treatment options for HCC are divided into surgical therapies (ie, resection, cryoablation, and liver transplantation) and nonsurgical therapies, which may be liver-directed (ie, percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, radiation, and radioembolization) or systemic (chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapy, hormone therapy). A general approach to the treatment of HCC is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57014\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57014 \">algorithm 1</a>). An alternative treatment algorithm has been proposed by the Barcelona Clinic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69566\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69566 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-advanced-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Attempts to generate algorithmic approaches to the treatment of HCC are difficult since new treatments and indications for various treatments are evolving rapidly. Furthermore, therapeutic approaches tend to vary based upon the available expertise as well as variability in the criteria for hepatic resection and liver transplantation. These issues and a general approach to treatment of HCC are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Here we will discuss systemic treatment approaches for patients with advanced unresectable HCC for whom liver-directed therapy is not appropriate. Surgical treatment, liver-directed nonsurgical therapies, and the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of HCC are reviewed separately. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palliative chemotherapy has not been used routinely for patients with advanced HCC for a number of reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCC has been considered to be a relatively chemotherapy-refractory tumor. This may be in part due to the high rate of expression of drug resistance genes, including p-glycoprotein, glutathione S-transferase, heat shock proteins, and mutations in p53.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can be difficult to gauge survival benefits from a systemic therapy regimen in patients with advanced HCC since survival is often determined not by tumor aggressiveness or the impact of a systemic treatment, but by the degree of hepatic dysfunction. Systemic chemotherapy is usually not well tolerated by patients with significant underlying hepatic dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical investigations of chemotherapy in advanced HCC have been undertaken in diverse patient populations. As an example, patients in Asian studies tend to be significantly younger with well-compensated cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), while North American or European patients with HCC are typically over 60 with alcoholic cirrhosis and comorbid illnesses. On the other hand, the primarily European HCV infected population enrolled in the SHARP trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> for advanced disease had considerably better outcomes (in both the treatment and placebo arms) than the predominantly HBV infected Asian population in a second study of the same design. (See <a href=\"#H477044332\" class=\"local\">'Sorafenib'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These results raise questions as to the applicability of the results (both efficacy and toxicity) of clinical trials that have utilized strict entry criteria to diverse populations.</p><p/><p>There has been a resurgence of interest and enthusiasm for systemic therapy of HCC with the emergence of data showing that single-agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> improves survival over best supportive care alone. These results established sorafenib monotherapy as the new reference standard systemic treatment for advanced HCC and formed the basis for approval of sorafenib for unresectable HCC in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H477044332\" class=\"local\">'Sorafenib'</a> below.)</p><p>However, there still may be a role for cytotoxic chemotherapy in selected medically appropriate patients who fail or are intolerant of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> and who have adequate hepatic function and a reasonable remaining life expectancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimating life expectancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several staging or prognostic systems have been developed to guide the prognosis and treatment of patients with HCC. These include the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM), Okuda, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP), Chinese University Prognostic Index (CUPI), Groupe d&rsquo;Etude et de Traitement du Carcinome Hepatocellulaire (GETCH), and Barcelona Clinic (BCLC) staging systems. These systems were developed based upon both surgical and nonsurgical patients, and they generally aim to classify patients with HCC broadly into those with early, intermediate, and advanced stage disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with advanced HCC are a heterogeneous group. There are substantial differences in overall survival that are due to factors not captured within the subgroups identified by these staging systems, and it is not clear that any of these staging systems provides meaningful prognostic discrimination among those with advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-advanced-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>However, there is some evidence that outcomes of nonsurgical HCC can be predicted by both patient and tumor characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-advanced-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prognostic scoring system for patients with advanced HCC not amenable to locoregional therapy has been proposed (the Advanced Liver Cancer Prognostic System [ALCPS]) that allows separation of three prognostic groups with significantly different three-month survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-advanced-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The stratification is based upon the assignment of a weighted point value to 11 different patient and tumor characteristics, with the total number of points corresponding to an estimated likelihood of three-month survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57772\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57772 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A new model has been developed based upon serum albumin and bilirubin alone (the albumin-bilirubin [ALBI] score) that provides a simple, objective, and discriminatory method of assessing liver function in patients with HCC; it was validated in geographically distinct cohorts of patients undergoing surgery for localized disease and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> for advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-advanced-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It seems to provide better prognostic discrimination for patients with HCC than the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score; among patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh A cirrhosis (who constituted the vast majority of the studied populations), two prognostically distinct subgroups emerged. The objective nature and simplicity of ALBI may diminish interobserver variation (as occurs with grading of ascites and encephalopathy in the Child-Turcotte-Pugh scoring system) and help to refine prognostic estimates in patients treated for HCC, particularly among those with better liver function. Independent validation of the model is needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H264051047\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'ALBI score'</a>.)</p><p/><p>While prognostic scoring systems such as these can objectively help clinicians select appropriate candidates for treatment and participation in clinical trials of new agents, there are no prospective data addressing their ability to predict which patients might benefit from any form of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Response assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventionally, treatment response of HCC to systemic therapy has been assessed by radiologic imaging using conventional response criteria such as the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74693\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74693 \">table 3</a>). However, criteria such as these may not accurately reflect response to treatment or tumor viability, particularly in the era of targeted therapy with agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a>, which are cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. In patients with HCC treated with sorafenib, tumor necrosis may initially be manifested as an enlarging rather than a shrinking lesion. An HCC expert consensus proposed the use of modified RECIST, which mainly measure tumor viability in assessing response for patients with HCC treated with targeted agents such as sorafenib (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58792 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-advanced-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Similarly, guidelines from the European Association for Study of the Liver (EASL) suggest that the estimated reduction in viable tumor burden using dynamic imaging techniques be incorporated into definitions for response for patients receiving local ablation therapies for HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-advanced-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete response &ndash; Absence of enhanced tumor areas, reflecting complete necrosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial response &ndash; A &gt;50 percent decrease in enhanced areas, reflecting partial tissue necrosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive disease &ndash; A &gt;25 percent increase in the size of &ge;1 measurable lesion or appearance of a new lesion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stable disease &ndash; Any tumor response between partial response and progressive disease </p><p/><p>Although not used widely for patients receiving systemic chemotherapy, response monitoring using functional criteria such as those of EASL or modified RECIST may provide a more accurate reflection of vital tumor burden and treatment benefit than standard RECIST, particularly for patients with cytostatic treatments targeting angiogenesis, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a>.

Overall survival, the primary endpoint, was significantly longer in the sorafenib-treated patients (10.7 versus 7.9 months), as was time to radiologic progression (5.5 versus 2.8 months).

An important unanswered question is whether there are differences in response to sorafenib in different populations and, in particular, based upon the etiology of the HCC.

Systemic chemotherapy is usually not well tolerated by patients with significant underlying hepatic dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical investigations of chemotherapy in advanced HCC have been undertaken in diverse patient populations. As an example, patients in Asian studies tend to be significantly younger with well-compensated cirrhosis due to chronic HBV or hepatitis C virus (HCV), while North American or European patients with HCC are typically over 60 with alcoholic cirrhosis and comorbid illnesses. Not only does this interfere with chemotherapy tolerance, dose, and the reported side effect profile, but in studies applying strict entry criteria, the results may be applicable only to the small minority of Western patients who have well-preserved hepatic function.</p><p/><p>Furthermore, chemotherapy may be less effective overall in patients with significant cirrhosis.

Hepatic reserve, as indicated by Child-Pugh class (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>), often dictates the therapeutic options. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic therapy is appropriate for patients with advanced unresectable disease who are unsuitable for locoregional therapy and whose liver function is adequate to tolerate systemic therapy (ie, Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>)).

To improve early tolerability, we typically start at 200 mg twice a day and increase the daily dose in 200 mg increments approximately every five days until the target dose is reached. We recommend against initiating sorafenib in patients with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3529276268\" class=\"local\">'Safety in patients with liver disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sorafenib</a> is feasible in conjunction with immunosuppressive therapy in patients with a recurrence of HCC following orthotopic liver transplantation, but it may be more toxic in this setting. Treatment should be closely monitored due to the potential for severe side effects and the need for dose modification. (See <a href=\"#H4270332507\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy following TACE or liver transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The safety and benefit of combining <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> and cytotoxic chemotherapy are not yet definitively established, and we suggest not pursuing these strategies outside of the context of a clinical trial (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1522434372\" class=\"local\">'Sorafenib plus doxorubicin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Based upon a preliminary report of the randomized noninferiority REFLECT trial, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenvatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenvatinib</a> is a reasonable first-line alternative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a>, especially for patients who cannot tolerate sorafenib. (See <a href=\"#H2495827668\" class=\"local\">'Lenvatinib'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For highly selected patients, systemic chemotherapy has the potential for a higher response rate than is seen with molecularly targeted therapy, and it may be preferred in situations where that is a primary goal of therapy. However, chemotherapy is associated with greater treatment-related toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H1386836156\" class=\"local\">'Systemic chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second-line therapy is an option for patients whose tumors progress while on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> and whose performance status and liver function are sufficient to tolerate it. The best regimen is not established. The side effect profile of each individual regimen must be carefully considered in patients who have advanced liver disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a short life expectancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We prefer that eligible patients be enrolled in clinical trials testing new treatment strategies, if possible. For patients who are not eligible for clinical trials or if they are not available, options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> (if it was not administered for first-line therapy), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regorafenib</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a>. For most patients who have progressed on sorafenib or are unable to take it, we suggest nivolumab rather than regorafenib (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). While regorafenib is also approved for this patient group, we now suggest treatment with nivolumab given the potential for a higher objective response rate (including some complete responders) and the more favorable side effect profile. (See <a href=\"#H998007681\" class=\"local\">'Regorafenib'</a> above and <a href=\"#H392168110\" class=\"local\">'Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Systemic chemotherapy is another option, although the best regimen is not established.
