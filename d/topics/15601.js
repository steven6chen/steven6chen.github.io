It is seen with therapeutic medication use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, and intentional self-poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Serotonin syndrome may involve a spectrum of clinical findings, which often include mental status changes, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serotonin syndrome has been observed in all age groups, including newborns and the elderly. The increasing incidence of this condition is thought to parallel the increasing use of serotonergic agents in medical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/1,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5</a>]. The syndrome has been described following intentional overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], and even in post-cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are perhaps the most commonly implicated group of medications associated with serotonin syndrome. The United States&rsquo; Toxic Exposure Surveillance System consistently reports tens of thousands of exposures to SSRIs, many of which involve serotonin syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>However, the true incidence of serotonin syndrome may be under-represented in such figures for a number of reasons. Manifestations may be wrongly attributed to another cause, mild cases may be dismissed, or clinicians may not suspect the condition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the central nervous system (CNS), serotonin modulates attention, behavior, and thermoregulation. In the peripheral nervous system, serotonin is produced primarily by intestinal enterochromaffin cells and is involved in regulating gastrointestinal motility, vasoconstriction, uterine contraction, and bronchoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Serotonin is also found in platelets where it promotes platelet aggregation.</p><p>Stimulation of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors has been implicated in serotonin syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], but no single receptor is solely responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Serotonin syndrome may result from any combination of drugs that has the net effect of increasing serotonergic neurotransmission (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64604 \">table 2</a>). The syndrome is classically associated with the simultaneous administration of two serotonergic agents, but it can occur after initiation of a single serotonergic drug or increasing the dose of a serotonergic drug in individuals who are particularly sensitive to serotonin. Episodes of serotonin syndrome involving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor may be more severe and more often lead to adverse outcomes, including death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233678580\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview and principles of evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome is made solely on clinical grounds. Therefore, a detailed history and thorough physical and neurologic examinations are essential.</p><p>Serotonin syndrome encompasses a spectrum of disease where the intensity of clinical findings is thought to reflect the degree of serotonergic activity. Mental status changes can include anxiety, agitated delirium, restlessness, and disorientation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients may startle easily. Autonomic manifestations can include diaphoresis, tachycardia, hyperthermia, hypertension, vomiting, and diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Neuromuscular hyperactivity can manifest as tremor, muscle rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and bilateral Babinski sign. Hyperreflexia and clonus are particularly common; these findings, as well as rigidity, are more often pronounced in the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Questions remain regarding the exact point at which serotonergic signs associated with therapeutic drug administration become the toxic reaction known as serotonin syndrome. The transition point likely depends upon an assessment of the risks and benefits of therapy. As an example, an individual treated for major depression with a serotonergic agent may develop mild tremor and hyperreflexia. Although technically meeting the diagnostic criteria for serotonin syndrome, the patient may benefit more (ie, be significantly less depressed) with continued administration of the agent, even though it produces obvious but tolerable signs of serotonergic excess. However, clinicians should be <strong>extremely careful</strong>&nbsp;<strong>not to add other serotonergic drugs</strong> to the regimen of such a patient, and must remain vigilant for any worsening in condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's history should include a detailed description of prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, illicit substances, and dietary supplements used, as well as any change in dosing and schedule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64604 \">table 2</a>). Clinicians should ask about the dose, formulation (eg, sustained release), and any recent changes in medications. Episodes of serotonin syndrome involving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor may be more severe and more often lead to adverse outcomes, including death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>A description of symptoms, their onset, and their rate of change is also important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The majority of cases of serotonin syndrome present within 24 hours, and most within six hours, of a change in dose or initiation of a drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Patients with intentional ingestions often develop greater toxicity than those with accidental exposures, so it is important to ask the patient directly about his or her intent. Information obtained from the overdose patient is often unreliable, however, and confirmation should be sought. Additional history, including comorbid conditions and signs and symptoms, should be elicited from the patient, family members, friends, emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, and police. A general approach to management of the poisoned patient is found elsewhere.

We suggest diagnosing serotonin syndrome using the Hunter Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. To fulfill the Hunter Criteria, a patient must have taken a serotonergic agent and meet <strong>ONE</strong> of the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous clonus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inducible clonus PLUS agitation or diaphoresis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular clonus PLUS agitation or diaphoresis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tremor PLUS hyperreflexia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertonia PLUS temperature above 38&ordm;C PLUS ocular clonus or inducible clonus</p><p/><p>Several sets of diagnostic criteria have been developed to define serotonin syndrome, of which the Hunter Criteria are most accurate (84 percent sensitive and 97 percent specific when compared with the gold standard of diagnosis by a medical toxicologist). In a comparison with the original Sternbach Criteria, the Hunter Criteria performed with greater accuracy and were less likely to miss early, mild, or subacute forms of serotonin syndrome. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of serotonin syndrome includes neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), anticholinergic toxicity, malignant hyperthermia, intoxication from sympathomimetic agents, sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, meningitis, and encephalitis. </p><p>Serotonin syndrome is often misdiagnosed as NMS, but the two can readily be distinguished on the basis of history, examination findings, and clinical course (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58227\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58227 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. NMS develops over days to weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], whereas serotonin syndrome develops over 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Serotonin syndrome is characterized by neuromuscular hyperreactivity (tremor, hyperreflexia, myoclonus), while NMS involves sluggish neuromuscular responses (rigidity, bradyreflexia). Hyperreflexia and myoclonus are rare in NMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, resolution of NMS typically requires an average of nine days, compared with less than 24 hours (usually) for resolution of serotonin syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Hyperthermia, altered mental status, muscle rigidity, leukocytosis, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated hepatic transaminases, and metabolic acidosis are seen in severe cases of both conditions, which highlight the necessity of a thorough history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anticholinergic toxicity classically presents with hyperthermia, agitation, altered mental status, mydriasis, dry mucous membranes, urinary retention, and decreased bowel sounds after the use of an anticholinergic agent. In contrast with serotonin syndrome, muscular tone and reflexes are normal in anticholinergic poisoning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anticholinergic-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anticholinergic poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Malignant hyperthermia occurs in susceptible individuals exposed to halogenated volatile anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>). It classically presents with increased concentrations of end-tidal carbon dioxide, rigor mortis-like muscle rigidity, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant hyperthermia: Clinical diagnosis and management of acute crisis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=susceptibility-to-malignant-hyperthermia-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serotonin syndrome may be distinguished from other causes of agitated delirium on the basis of neuromuscular findings. Whereas patients with serotonin syndrome show signs of neuromuscular activation (eg, tremor, hyperreflexia and clonus that are greater in the lower extremities, ocular clonus, and increased muscle tone), patients with sympathomimetic toxicity or infections of the central nervous system lack these findings. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233678965\"><span class=\"h2\">Key principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A summary table to facilitate the emergent management of serotonin syndrome is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73400\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73400 \">table 1</a>). Five principles are central to the management of serotonin syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discontinuation of all serotonergic agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64604 \">table 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive care aimed at normalization of vital signs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedation with benzodiazepines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of serotonin antagonists</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of the need to resume use of causative serotonergic agents after resolution of symptoms</p><p/><p>Application of these principles varies with the severity of illness. In mild cases, discontinuation of inciting medications, supportive care, and sedation with benzodiazepines are generally sufficient. Moderately ill patients require more aggressive treatment of autonomic instability and possibly treatment with a serotonin antagonist (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Antidote: Cyproheptadine'</a> below). Hyperthermic patients (&gt;41.1&deg;C) are critically ill and often require neuromuscular paralysis and tracheal intubation.</p><p>Common management pitfalls include failure to recognize serotonin syndrome, misdiagnosis, and failure to understand serotonin syndrome's potentially rapid rate of progression (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above). Even if the diagnosis remains unclear, the clinician should withhold serotonergic agents and provide aggressive supportive care, anticipating the need for interventions before the patient's condition deteriorates.</p><p>Serotonin syndrome often resolves within 24 hours of discontinuing the serotonergic agent and initiating care, but drugs with long half-lives or active metabolites may cause symptoms to persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) carry the greatest risk, and symptoms can persist for several days. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome up to several weeks after the drug has been discontinued; the half-life of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> is one week and that of its metabolite norfluoxetine is up to 2.5 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although the patient may not exhibit symptoms of serotonin syndrome while taking fluoxetine, care should be taken when administering another serotonergic agent after discontinuing this or any other SSRI.</p><p>As with any toxic exposure, consultation with a medical toxicologist, clinical pharmacologist, or poison control center can provide valuable assistance with clinical decision-making. (See <a href=\"#H9902974\" class=\"local\">'Additional resources'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care and sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supportive care is the mainstay of therapy and includes the administration of oxygen and intravenous fluids, continuous cardiac monitoring, and correction of vital signs. Clinicians should provide sufficient oxygen to maintain the oxygen saturation &ge; 94 percent, and give IV crystalloid to treat volume depletion, and to some extent hyperthermia.</p><p>Chemical restraint is greatly preferred to physical restraint for agitated patients; physical restraints may cause isometric muscle contractions leading to profound lactic acidosis and hyperthermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Sedation with benzodiazepines is important for controlling agitation as well as correcting mild increases in blood pressure and heart rate. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diazepam</a> prolongs survival in a rat model of serotonin syndrome, but no specific agent has been studied in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Regardless of the benzodiazepine selected, the clinician should give standard doses to begin therapy and titrate further treatment to effect, the goals being adequate patient sedation (not somnolence) and normal vital signs. </p><p>We treat patients with significant agitation (eg, those who do not respond immediately to verbal interventions) with intravenous (IV) benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> 2 to 4 mg IV or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> 5 to 10 mg IV). These doses can be repeated every 8 to 10 minutes based upon patient response. Butyrophenones (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">droperidol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>) should be avoided; these drugs have anticholinergic properties that inhibit sweating and dissipation of body heat. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Autonomic instability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of autonomic instability may be difficult since severely intoxicated patients often exhibit large and rapid changes in blood pressure and heart rate.

Those with moderate symptoms should be admitted for observation and placed on a cardiac monitor until symptoms resolve. Symptoms usually resolve within 24 hours of discontinuing the serotonergic agent and initiating care, but drugs with long durations of action or active metabolites may cause prolonged symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Mild cases may be observed for four to six hours. If during that period the patient's mental status and vital signs remain normal, there is no increase in clonus or deep tendon reflexes, and close follow-up is assured, the patient may be discharged home.</p><p>It merits reiteration that serotonin syndrome manifests a broad spectrum of clinical severity. Particularly in mild cases, clinicians must weigh benefits and risks when determining treatment and whether to continue the causative agent.

The same diagnostic criteria, characterized by increased neuromuscular activity, are used in the pediatric population. Hyperreflexia, clonus, and hyperthermia remain important findings. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p>Although multiple case reports have been published, several obstacles make the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome more difficult in pediatric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Children may not be able to communicate vague symptoms; clinicians may not consider the syndrome a pediatric problem; and adolescents may be reluctant to disclose recreational drug use, which may include serotonergic agents, such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; &quot;ecstasy&quot;) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dextromethorphan</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Any serotonergic agent is discontinued. Supportive care is provided, the goals being adequate patient sedation and normal vital signs. Standard interventions include oxygen, intravenous fluids, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Autonomic instability and hyperthermia require aggressive treatment.

The patient's history should include a detailed description of prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, illicit substances, and dietary supplements used, as well as any change in dosing and schedule. Clinicians should ask about both the dose, the formulation (eg, sustained release), and any recent changes in all medications.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome is made solely on clinical grounds using the Hunter Criteria; a detailed history and thorough physical and neurologic examination are essential. To fulfill the Hunter Criteria, a patient must have taken a serotonergic agent and meet <strong>ONE</strong> of the following conditions (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spontaneous clonus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inducible clonus PLUS agitation or diaphoresis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ocular clonus PLUS agitation or diaphoresis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tremor PLUS hyperreflexia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypertonia PLUS temperature above 38&deg;C PLUS ocular clonus or inducible clonus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serotonin syndrome is a clinical diagnosis; serotonin concentrations do not correlate with clinical findings, and no laboratory test confirms the diagnosis.
