It typically presents in childhood or adolescence as a sharply circumscribed, dome-shaped, pink-red papule most commonly located on the face or lower extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85817\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85817 \">picture 1</a>). The clinical relevance of Spitz tumor lies in its close histologic resemblance to melanoma. In some cases, differentiating Spitz tumors from melanoma may be difficult or impossible even for the expert pathologist. Spitzoid lesions are often not classified in any standardized way, evoke uncertainty in diagnosis by pathologists, and elicit variability in treatment recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spitzoid-melanocytic-neoplasms-spitz-nevus-and-atypical-spitz-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The classification, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of Spitz tumors will be discussed here. Congenital nevi, acquired melanocytic nevi, and atypical nevi are discussed separately.

In 1948 Sophie Spitz articulated for the first time criteria for this unusual group of childhood melanocytic lesions that histologically resembled melanomas but did not demonstrate the typical aggressive clinical behavior commonly associated with adult melanomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spitzoid-melanocytic-neoplasms-spitz-nevus-and-atypical-spitz-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Of interest, one of Spitz's original 13 cases resulted in metastasis and death of the patient. These lesions were termed &quot;juvenile melanomas&quot; to distinguish them from adult melanoma and benign nevi of childhood. Subsequently, various terms have been used for this group of lesions including &quot;Spitz nevus,&quot; &quot;Spitz tumor,&quot; and &quot;spindle and epithelioid cell nevus.&quot;</p><p>Atypical variants of Spitz tumors have been termed &quot;atypical Spitz tumors,&quot; &quot;spindle and epithelioid cell nevus with atypia and metastasis,&quot; &quot;melanocytic tumor of unknown malignant potential,&quot; or &quot;spitzoid tumor of uncertain malignant potential&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spitzoid-melanocytic-neoplasms-spitz-nevus-and-atypical-spitz-tumors/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p>In this topic we will use the term &quot;Spitz tumor&quot; as a general term for all types of Spitz lesions. Spitz lesions with one or more atypical features and those with indeterminate biologic behavior will be referred to as &quot;atypical Spitz tumors.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H179431603\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H487090\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spitz tumors represent about 1 percent of the nevi excised in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spitzoid-melanocytic-neoplasms-spitz-nevus-and-atypical-spitz-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Although many of the cytologic features of the tumor cells are reminiscent of epithelioid cells of Spitz nevi, other features characteristically present in Spitz nevi (eg, clefting around junctional melanocytic nests, spindle-shaped melanocytes, epidermal hyperplasia, hypergranulosis, and Kamino bodies)&nbsp;are usually absent. In addition, these tumors may show a biphasic (or combined) configuration, in particular, a conventional junctional, compound or dermal nevus remnant composed of small melanocytes expressing BAP1 in concert with a distinctive dermal lesion formed by large epithelioid BAP1-negative melanocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spitzoid-melanocytic-neoplasms-spitz-nevus-and-atypical-spitz-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

However, many of these melanomas labeled as &quot;spitzoid&quot; have no relationship to spitzoid melanocytic neoplasms.

Zonation refers to the uniform organization of melanocytes across a horizontal axis of the lesion.
