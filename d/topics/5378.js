In its primary form, a woman has pain from her first experience with a tampon, speculum, or sexual relations. In its secondary form, the pain develops after a period of comfortable sexual relations. The diagnosis is clinical, based on characteristic history, a positive Q-tip test eliciting pain in the vestibule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72614\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72614 \">figure 2</a>), and exclusion of other pathology. It is important to recognize that the Q-tip test may be positive in the presence of inflammation, atrophy, infection and pelvic floor dysfunction. </p><p>Elimination of any vulvar pathology is essential. After treatment of any identified cause of pain, the pain itself needs treatment. Dyspareunia may be reduced or prevented with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> ointment (5 percent in a neutral base) applied to the vestibule 10 minutes before intercourse and again after intercourse, if necessary. EMLA (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-and-prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine-prilocaine</a>) cream is an alternative therapy. Physical therapy directed at the pelvic floor muscles can also be effective since these women have superficial pelvic floor muscles that are more tonic and more responsive to pressure than women without provoked vulvar pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

However, it is possible to have all the symptoms included in the criteria without having nerve entrapment. </p><p>PN may also manifest as sexual pain, although this is not a universal finding.

Vulvar, vaginal, and urinary tract epithelium express a relatively large number of estrogen receptors and thus, are susceptible to the decreased levels of circulating estrogens that occur with ovarian failure at natural or iatrogenic menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Hypoestrogenism causes changes in the vagina and a lack of adequate vaginal lubrication with sexual arousal, both of which result in dyspareunia.</p><p>Additional clinical manifestations include vaginal dryness, burning, pruritus, discharge, and possibly vaginal bleeding. Urinary tract symptoms (eg, frequency, recurrent infection) may also occur. On physical examination, the vaginal mucosa is thin with diffuse erythema, occasional petechiae or ecchymoses, and few or no vaginal folds. The vaginal pH is &ge;5.0. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mild urogenital atrophy from low estrogen levels is also seen with other conditions, such as during the postpartum period and with breastfeeding, with use of certain medications (eg, low estrogen dose contraceptives, depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a>, gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>), and with hypothalamic-pituitary disorders.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment &ndash; Nonhormonal treatments include moisturizers and lubricants (eg, Replens, K-Y jelly, Astroglide). Low dose local estrogen therapy is usually effective and has negligible systemic effects. When estrogen therapy is not effective, sexual pain is probably not related to urogenital atrophy and other causes should be sought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Estrogen deficiency (described above) predominates in the older woman, but is possible in any age group. In a younger woman, inadequate lubrication is associated with inhibited arousal resulting from inadequate foreplay technique, relationship issues and interpersonal conflict, and some medications used to treat high blood pressure or depression. Other medications that can cause significant vaginal dryness unrelated to estrogen levels include antihistamines (first generation H1 blockers, not second generation) and anticholinergic agents.</p><p>Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome is a medical disorder associated with vaginal dryness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], diabetes may also be associated with decreased lubrication and sexual dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment &ndash; Management of the underlying disease (physical or psychiatric), avoiding causative medications when possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67305\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67305 \">table 2</a>), and use of topical moisturizers and lubricants can be helpful.</p><p/><p>Water-based lubricants (eg, K-Y, Astroglide, saliva, glycerine, silicone) can be used with latex condoms, but oil-based lubricants (baby oil, many hand and body lotions, petroleum jelly) reduce latex condom integrity and may facilitate breakage.

The true incidence of vaginismus is unknown as women frequently do not discuss their symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Observational studies of women evaluated in sexual health clinics have reported a prevalence of 5 to 42 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Vaginismus has traditionally referred to involuntary contraction of the muscles of the pelvic floor surrounding the vaginal orifice. The patient is averse to vaginal penetration (sexual and nonsexual, such as gynecological examination, tampon, dilators) due to actual or anticipated pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Evidence from electromyography (EMG) studies does not strongly support a vaginal muscle spasm mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. An operational definition of the term &ldquo;muscle spasm&rdquo; does not exist, and there has been a lack of consensus regarding which muscles are involved in vaginismus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].<sup> </sup>Studies identifying specific muscle groups as the source of spasm did not indicate the method used to arrive at these conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and it is important to recognize that the diagnosis of vaginismus has relied mainly on clinicians and researchers who do not do physical evaluations of their patients. On the other hand, a number of studies have shown that the pain of vaginismus is similar to the pain of provoked vulvodynia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Many different organic factors can lead to vulvovaginal pain through a variety of pathways; congenital abnormality, acute or chronic inflammation, atrophy, loss of epithelial integrity, and central nervous system sensitization are a few examples. Often, these are undiagnosed vulvovaginal disorders. Organic factors often combine with other factors such as anxiety and phobia, disgust, lack of sexual knowledge, cultural and religious beliefs, genital and sexual trauma, and abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24</a>]. Although unproven by randomized, controlled trials, these combinations may represent the explanation for vulvovaginal pain, dyspareunia, and pelvic floor <span class=\"nowrap\">dysfunction/vaginismus</span>.</p><p>Physical exam is performed to rule out physical conditions, such as infection or inflammatory dermatitis, which may have triggered the pain. If a known cause is identified, both the cause and the pain of pelvic <span class=\"nowrap\">floor/vaginismus</span> require treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain#H1178544832\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the woman with sexual pain&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Primary and secondary vaginismus may be treated initially with myofascial release of muscle tension in muscles of the pelvic floor, thighs, and abdomen, with or without biofeedback.

Activities include Kegel exercises, the pelvic floor drop technique (reverse Kegel), and use of dilators. Self-insertion of dilators of gradually increasing size in and out of the vagina teach the woman that control of introital musculature can be voluntary and painless. Desensitization is the goal of dilator therapy, not physical enlargement of the vaginal opening. A small amount of topical anesthetic should always be used on any object inserted intravaginally since desensitization will not occur without painless insertion.</p><p>Other therapeutic approaches include sex therapy, progressive relaxation, sensate focus, electromyography, biofeedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], use of benzodiazepines, hypnotherapy, and Botulinum toxin type A injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]; none have been evaluated in well-designed studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">URINARY TRACT DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with painful bladder <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/interstitial</span> cystitis have pain, which is associated with bladder filling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> emptying, and usually accompanied by urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, and dyspareunia.

However, the opposite of weak muscles is most likely to lead to pain: the development of hypertonic, dysfunctional muscles. Only recently has the pelvic floor been recognized as a major contributor to pelvic and vulvar pain, vulvodynia, vaginismus, and dyspareunia. In a recent retrospective study of 238 patients with complaints of urination, defecation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sexual problems, 77.2 percent had measurable pelvic floor dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Unfortunately, pelvic floor hypertonic disorders are often not considered in the evaluation and management of patients with these problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Pelvic floor dysfunction may originate in childhood with holding of urine or stool and inability to relax to void or defecate. Pelvic floor hypertonicity follows. Holding patterns in adults related to work situations that do not favor regular voiding may also lead to dysfunction. Mechanical factors such as occupational postural positions or prolonged lack of motion such as long car rides may lead to pain. Postural abnormalities such as differential in leg length, gait abnormality, or pelvic girdle abnormality, may also lead to hypertonicity and pain. Skeletal asymmetry leads to muscular imbalance, which causes muscle overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A trigger, the demands of pregnancy and delivery, or of sports activity such as running, may precipitate the symptoms. Injury to the pelvic floor musculature with traumatic delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], vaginal surgery or other trauma may also be causes of the pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Severe anxiety disorders and a history of sexual abuse can also contribute to such disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].<sup> </sup></p><p>The diagnosis of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome, coccydynia, pelvic floor tension myalgia, piriformis syndrome, levator ani spasm syndrome, and proctalgia fugax all share hypertonicity of some of the pelvic musculature as an underlying problem, and may represent various manifestations of the same disease state. Pain is caused by involuntary spasm of the pelvic floor muscles, usually with hypersensitive trigger points. Spasm induced by these entities can persist after the original insult has resolved. However, an antecedent cause may not be identified.</p><p>During intercourse, trigger points of the pelvic floor often refer pain to the vagina, vulva, perineum, rectum, and bladder, but pain can be referred to more distant areas such as the thighs, buttocks, or lower abdomen. Irritative symptoms (eg, urinary urgency, vulvovaginal burning, rectal fullness) may be more prominent than pain.

Learning theory considers dyspareunia the result of absent or faulty learning, which may cause a woman to enter a sexual relationship with a set of negative expectations. Others have suggested that an initial painful sexual experience or sexual abuse leads to repetitive conditioned negative responses with subsequent experiences. It is likely that most patients with dyspareunia have both physical and psychologic factors that cause and then perpetuate their symptoms.

Reconceptualization of vaginismus and dyspareunia as primarily pain disorders that interfere with sexuality may help focus the clinician on the central phenomenon, which is pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>For example, cognitive behavior therapy shows the woman how her thought patterns, emotions, and behaviors contribute to her pain and then teaches her how to modify these thought patterns, emotions, and behaviors to decrease muscle tension and cope with and alleviate pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">LICHEN PLANUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erosive lichen planus is the most common type of vulvar lichen planus. The desquamative, erosive, chronic dermatitis often also involves the vagina. Lesions are characterized by glassy, brightly erythematous erosions with white striae or a white border (Wickham's striae) often visible along the margins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60224\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60224 \">picture 1</a>); occasionally, a violaceous border is noted, as well. The lesions may occur on the labia minora and vestibule as isolated lesions on an otherwise normal vulva, or they may be associated with marked architectural destruction, including loss of the labia minora and narrowing of the introitus. Recurrent exacerbations, slow healing, and scarring are common. Scarring can cause significant anatomic disruption, including severe stenosis of the vaginal opening and urethral obstruction. Dyspareunia and difficulty with <span class=\"nowrap\">urination/dysuria</span> are the major symptoms of severe progressive disease.</p><p>Initial symptoms typically occur in women 50 to 60 years of age (range 29 to 82 years) and frequently present as intense pruritus or vulvar pain, soreness, or burning. However, this clinical scenario is not specific to lichen planus, as it occurs with most vulvar disorders. Treatment (eg, an ultra-potent topical glucocorticoid) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-planus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen planus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">LICHEN SCLEROSUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classic lichen sclerosus is expressed as white, atrophic papules that may coalesce into plaques.

Dyspareunia is often a late symptom of lichen sclerosus. Pain is caused by introital stenosis, fissures, or posterior deflection of fused labial tissues at the time of intromission. Fusion over the clitoris can also cause diminished sexual sensation or even anorgasmia, although this is not common. Marked dyspareunia may occur in perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with estrogen deficiency in addition to lichen sclerosus. Treatment (eg, an ultra-potent topical glucocorticoid) is discussed separately.
