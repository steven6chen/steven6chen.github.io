Antibodies facilitate numerous cellular and humoral reactions to a variety of antigens, including those of the host (self) and foreign substances.</p><p>Most antibodies produced as part of the normal immune response are polyclonal, meaning that they are produced by a number of distinct B lymphocytes, and, as a result, they each have a slightly different specificity for the target antigen (eg, by binding different epitopes or binding the same epitope with different affinities). However, it is possible to produce large quantities of an antibody from a single B-cell clone.</p><p>Since 1985, approximately 100 independent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been designated as drugs. Available mAbs are directed against a large number of antigens and used for the treatment of immunologic diseases, reversal of drug effects, and cancer therapy. The World Health Organization (WHO), which is responsible for therapeutic mAb nomenclature, reported in 2017 that over 500 mAb names have been provided. (See <a href=\"#H3486803348\" class=\"local\">'Naming convention for therapeutic mAbs'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of therapeutic mAbs, including their mechanisms of action, production, modifications, nomenclature, administration, and adverse effects.</p><p>Separate topic reviews discuss clinical uses of polyclonal antibodies, including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> products (SCIG, IMIG, and IVIG, respectively):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>SCIG and IMIG</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous and intramuscular immune globulin therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune globulin therapy in primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>IVIG</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravenous immune globulin: Adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Separate reviews also discuss the basic principles of antibody genetics, immunoglobulin structure, and cellular and humoral immunity.

The name of the mAb specifies certain features such as proposed target, original host, modifications, and conjugation to other molecules. Naming rules from the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) expert group of the World Health Organization (WHO) were originally published in 1995 and have been updated periodically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>INN documents from the WHO published in 2014 and 2017 describe the classification for mAb names [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. The mAb names consist of a prefix, two substems (reduced to one substem in the 2017 document), and a suffix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F114279\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114279 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prefix is referred to as &quot;random&quot;; it is intended to provide a unique, distinct drug name.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The substems (also called &quot;infixes&quot;) designate the target (eg, &quot;ci&quot; for cardiovascular, &quot;so&quot; for bone, &quot;tu&quot; for tumor) and the source (host) in which the antibody was originally produced (eg, &quot;u&quot; for human, &quot;o&quot; for mouse), as well as modifications (eg, &quot;-xi-&quot; for chimeric, &quot;-zu-&quot; for humanized). The second substem (which specifies the source of the antibody and whether it is humanized or chimeric) was eliminated in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This change only applies to mAb names created after mid-2017; names created before that time will not be altered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The suffix for all mAbs is &quot;mab.&quot; There are rare exceptions such as a few of the earliest mAb products that were produced before the &quot;mab&quot; stem was established in 1990 (eg, muromonab-CD3 [OKT3], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-immune-fab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin immune Fab</a>).</p><p/><p>The rationale for eliminating the second substem that specifies the host included several concerns, such as the large number of antibody names being created, the use of the species information as a marketing tool despite lack of scientific support for true clinically important differences, and conceptual ambiguities that led to confusion, especially related to chimeric and humanized antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Thus, mAbs named after mid-2017 may have longer prefixes and shorter substems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1847046251\"><span class=\"h1\">PRODUCTION METHODS AND SPECIAL MODIFICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>mAbs are homogenous preparations of antibodies (or fragments of antibodies) in which every antibody in the product is identical in its protein sequence, and thus every antibody is expected to have the same antigen recognition site, affinity, biologic interactions, and downstream biologic effects. This distinguishes mAbs from polyclonal antibodies, which are heterogenous in protein sequence and recognize heterogeneous epitopes on an antigen.</p><p>Additional methods are used to modify and mass produce the mAb that is ultimately administered to patients as a medical therapy, as discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1895538379\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial antibody selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A key to an effective mAb is the quality of the interaction between its hypervariable region (also called the complementarity-determining region [CDR]) and the target antigen. The choice of target antigen is usually based on the scientific understanding of disease mechanism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> observation of disease-specific antibody effects in preclinical models or individual patients.</p><p>Also key to clinical efficacy and low toxicity are the downstream effects of antibody-antigen binding. These effects can be reduced by using antibodies that lack certain epitopes from foreign (eg, nonhuman) species, although immunogenicity of the mAb is complex (ie, it is not simply a matter of the number of amino acid residues).</p><p>Several approaches are used for the creation of antibodies that react with the desired target:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunize an animal</strong> &ndash; An animal (typically a mouse or rat) may be immunized with the target antigen. This was the most popular (and the only technically feasible) method in the early days of mAb production. Candidate B cells for producing a therapeutic mAb with specificity for the target are obtained by harvesting spleen cells from the animal. An example of an mAb created by this method is muromonab-CD3 (Orthoclone OKT3).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A serious risk with this approach is that some individuals exposed to mouse antibodies develop an immune response to the mouse antibody sequence. Once an individual develops a human-anti-mouse antibody, they generally cannot receive additional doses of the original mAb or other therapeutic mAbs with a similar murine sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Thus, approaches were developed to engineer changes to the immunoglobulin molecule such as humanizing the antibody or creating a chimeric antibody; these are used in the majority of mAbs initially selected in animals. Mice have been engineered with human immunoglobulin loci in place of the endogenous mouse sequences, thus generating human antibodies in mice. (See <a href=\"#H2204200890\" class=\"local\">'Modifications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obtain an existing antibody</strong> &ndash; An existing antibody against a target antigen can be isolated from a patient. This method is especially applicable to cancer therapeutics because removal of a tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> regional lymph nodes is often used in routine treatment. These tissues can be used to harvest tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Existing antibodies can also be isolated from peripheral blood, bone marrow, or other lymphoid tissues such as the spleen or tonsils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Examples of this method include various investigational mAbs against viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Screen a library</strong> &ndash; A library of antibodies (constructed using molecular techniques or purchased) can be screened in vitro for binding to a target antigen. Libraries vary widely in their size and diversity. They can be generated using phage display or other combinatorial methods. With a phage display library, a large collection of sequences can be introduced into bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria) in a stoichiometry such that each bacteriophage clone produces a single antibody or antibody fragment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The size and diversity of the library can be adjusted by the investigator. Larger more diverse libraries are more likely to produce a therapeutic mAb or an mAb fragment that has the highest affinity and specificity for the target antigen. Examples of therapeutic mAbs that were derived from a phage display library include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raxibacumab-united-states-availability-limited-to-cdc-distribution-from-strategic-national-stockpile-in-consultation-with-local-health-department-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raxibacumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=belimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">belimumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Once an mAb with a desired specificity has been obtained, it must be produced in large quantities for therapeutic use. The earliest production technology was to create a hybridoma (a cell-cell fusion) in which the antibody-producing cell is fused with a partner cell that has been immortalized. The partner usually used is a myeloma cell (a malignant B cell) that will proliferate indefinitely in culture. For mAb production from a hybridoma, the myeloma cell line must be nonsecreting; otherwise, the hybridoma would also produce the antibodies from the myeloma cell line.</p><p>Once candidate hybridomas have been created, they must be screened for immortalization and antibody production. Screening for immortalization can be done using a method that takes advantage of a specialized growth medium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71530\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71530 \">figure 1</a>). In this method, the nonsecreting myeloma cell line has a defect in the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which permits a cell to use xanthine and guanine as nucleotide precursors rather than synthesizing them de novo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A cell with this enzyme defect will survive unless it is cultured in the presence of an inhibitor of de novo nucleotide synthesis such as aminopterin, which will render it unable to make any purine nucleotides. When the candidate hybridoma cell lines are cultured in the presence of aminopterin, only the lines that have successfully fused and contain HGPRT from the fusion partner will survive because they can use hypoxanthine to make purine nucleotides. Thymidine is also added to the culture medium since its synthesis is inhibited by aminopterin. This selection medium is referred to as HAT medium (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine). Screening for antibody production can be done using an immunoassay on the cell supernatant for binding to the target antigen.</p><p>Other methods have been developed for immortalization such as transfection with an immortalizing virus or production in an immortal cell culture line such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H437638832\"><span class=\"h2\">Mass production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a source of the desired mAb (hybridoma, cell line, or other system) has been established, production must be scaled up to accommodate clinical use. A requirement for several grams of mAb per patient is not unusual. mAbs are large multimeric proteins (typical molecular weight, approximately 150 kilodaltons [kD]), and their proper functioning requires a number of post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and formation of disulfide bonds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, a eukaryotic production system that carries out normal eukaryotic post-translational modifications is used.</p><p>The major method of mAb production is using cultured cells such as CHO cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Alternative eukaryotic cell lines for mAb production are under consideration, such as yeast, which grow faster than mammalian cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Quality controls and purification steps are used to ensure a homogenous product with defined potency that is free of endotoxin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> host cell proteins. Potency is assayed using an immunoassay or a cell-based assay.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2204200890\"><span class=\"h2\">Modifications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3477242052\"><span class=\"h3\">Fab fragments and single-chain antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of antibody fragments instead of full-length antibodies may enhance pharmacokinetic properties <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the efficiency of penetration into tissues or tumor masses (since fragments are smaller) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Fragments typically have a single valence (binding site) for the antigen, rather than two valences that are characteristic of full-length antibodies. The following types of antibody fragments have been created, typically using molecular biology techniques in the laboratory:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fragment antigen binding (Fab)</strong> &ndash; Also called Fab fragments, these consist of a variable domain and the first constant region each of heavy and light chain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Single-chain variable fragment (scFv)</strong> &ndash; An scFv consists of a light chain and heavy chain variable region joined by a linker peptide</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Single-domain antibody (sdAb)</strong> &ndash; An sdAb is an antibody fragment consisting of a light chain variable region or heavy chain variable region</p><p/><p>A popular method for producing these fragments is use of a phage display library that can be used to screen large collections of potential antibody fragments for their binding to the antigen and other desired properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1895538379\" class=\"local\">'Initial antibody selection'</a> above.)</p><p>Fab fragments lack the Fc component of the antibody (the remainder of the heavy chain) and thus are not capable of interacting with Fc receptors or activating complement. Thus, alone, they typically are not appropriate for indications that depend on cell killing. Examples of clinical applications include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ranibizumab</a> is a recombinant humanized mAb Fab fragment that binds to and inhibits human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Ranibizumab inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors and thereby suppresses neovascularization and slows vision loss. This agent is used in the treatment of some forms of age-related macular degeneration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Age-related macular degeneration: Treatment and prevention&quot;, section on 'Ranibizumab'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abciximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Abciximab</a> is a Fab antibody fragment derived from a chimeric human-murine mAb (7E3) that binds to platelet <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> receptors, resulting in steric hindrance and thus inhibition of platelet aggregation. Abciximab is used in unstable angina and reduction of thrombosis in various coronary stenting procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-trials-of-platelet-glycoprotein-iib-iiia-receptor-inhibitors-in-coronary-heart-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early trials of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Abciximab'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H291407546\"><span class=\"h3\">Humanized and chimeric mAbs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>mAbs originally derived from a nonhuman species (eg, mouse, rat) can be &quot;humanized&quot; to various degrees by engineering amino acid substitutions that make them more similar to the human sequence. This is done using recombinant DNA technologies.</p><p>In principle, the more similar an mAb is to human-derived sequences shared among many individuals, the less likely it is to elicit an immune reaction against the mAb. Potential adverse effects of immunogenicity include infusion reactions and reduced efficacy, although these are not easily predicted. (See <a href=\"#H1744751947\" class=\"local\">'Infusion reactions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1068700636\" class=\"local\">'Resistance'</a> below.)</p><p>However, not all amino acid residues or groups of residues are similar in their immunogenicity. Further, it has become increasingly challenging to clarify what constitutes a chimeric antibody versus what constitutes a humanized antibody (eg, how many amino acid residues need to be changed for an antibody to qualify as humanized), and definitions have evolved over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In general, humanized mAbs contain segments from nonhuman sources in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) interspersed among human-derived segments in the constant regions of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. Chimeric antibodies are generally those in which the Fc part of the immunoglobulin molecule (but not the CDR) is of a human sequence. In general, chimeric mAbs and humanized antibodies contain &gt;65 and &gt;90 percent human sequence, respectively. In addition, several technologies exist to generate fully humanized antibodies for therapeutic use.</p><p>Prior to mid-2017, an mAb that had been humanized was designated by inclusion of the stem &quot;zu&quot; in its name (eg, trastu<strong>zu</strong>mab), and chimeric mAbs were designated as chimeric by the addition of &quot;xi&quot; (eg, ritu<strong>xi</strong>mab). However, as noted above, ongoing issues with accurately classifying an mAb as humanized or chimeric and the potential for these designations to be used as a marketing tool in the absence of scientific support for reduced immunogenicity of the nonhuman components have led to the decision that antibodies named after mid-2017 will not contain the &quot;zu&quot; and &quot;xi&quot; stems in their generic names. (See <a href=\"#H3486803348\" class=\"local\">'Naming convention for therapeutic mAbs'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1921678453\"><span class=\"h3\">Bifunctional antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bifunctional antibodies (also called &quot;bispecific&quot; antibodies) are mAbs in which the two different valences (heavy-light chain CDR pairs) of the antibody bind to two different antigens. This allows the antibody to bring two different antigens (or two cells, or a protein and a cell) into close physical proximity, which in turn may carry out a new function. Examples of bifunctional mAbs include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emicizumab binds to two coagulation factors (factor IXa and factor X), taking the place of activated factor VIII (factor VIIIa) in the coagulation cascade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F107801\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107801 \">figure 2</a>). This mAb is available for prophylaxis against bleeding in certain individuals with hemophilia A.

Drugs or toxins are typically attached to the immunoglobulin molecule using covalent binding to prevent their premature dissociation before reaching the target cell. Early-generation drug conjugates had heterogenous ratios of drug to antibody, but subsequent methods for ensuring more consistent stoichiometry have been developed, including engineered alternate amino acids that selectively bind the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1791627755\"><span class=\"h3\">Antigenized antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antigenization is an investigational approach in which an mAb can be engineered to deliver an antigen (eg, as a vaccine). This is done by replacing part of the antibody polypeptide with a fragment of a microbial antigen. Any sequence can be inserted into various portions of the antibody molecule. Antigenized mAbs are potentially useful as vaccines since they have a longer serum half-life compared with the isolated antigen fragment and may be better tolerated than some microbial fragments.</p><p>The successful presentation of microbial peptides contained in antibody molecules has been shown in a variety of animal systems (eg, for influenza virus in mice) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, this potentially promising technology has not advanced beyond animal studies. For example, using recombinant DNA methods, a bovine herpes virus B-cell epitope was grafted onto a bovine immunoglobulin molecule.

The following discussion is an overview of the general principles of how therapeutic mAbs sequester or destroy their targets.</p><p>One of the key distinguishing attributes of mAbs is their affinity for the target antigen, which is determined by the variable <span class=\"nowrap\">region/complementarity-determining</span> region (CDR). Antibodies with greater affinity can be selected in the laboratory. Affinity is quantified by calculating the association constant for binding between the antibody and a single monovalent antigen in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. When the antibody is bivalent (eg, full-length), this affinity is amplified (eg, 10<sup>18</sup> [a virtually irreversible binding reaction] rather than 10<sup>9</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">L/mol)</span>. Antibody affinities are most often in the range of 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>11</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">L/mol</span> (picomolar to nanomolar affinity).</p><p>Another key attribute of mAbs is their ability to recruit other immune cells and molecules (such as complement), both of which can promote killing of target cells. This recruitment is mediated by the Fc (fragment crystallizable) portion of the antibody (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56393 \">figure 3</a>), which includes the heavy-chain second and third constant regions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2658331104\"><span class=\"h2\">Target is a cell surface antigen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The desired effect of an mAb directed against a cell surface antigen may involve blocking the function of a cell surface receptor or killing of the target cell.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases the target antigen may be a cell surface receptor, and mAb binding may block the <span class=\"nowrap\">normal/physiologic</span> ligand from binding the receptor, thus interfering with receptor function and in turn preventing cell proliferation or survival. Examples include mAbs directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or the receptor tyrosine kinase erbB-2 (also known as HER2).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In other cases, the target may be a tumor cell or a B-cell clone that produces an autoantibody (eg, an antiplatelet antibody in immune thrombocytopenia [ITP]). The mechanism of cell killing may involve recruitment of complement proteins, phagocytes, or natural killer (NK) cells, which can promote immune-mediated destruction of the cell(s) expressing the target antigen on their surface.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Recruitment of immune mediators generally occurs through interactions with the Fc portion of the mAb. Fc receptors can modulate the cell killing effects of mAbs by recruiting effector cells to effect antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-mediated phagocytosis by <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Fc receptors can also promote cell death via complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), in which mAb binding to target cells results in the activation of the complement cascade. Some antibodies have features of both ADCC and CDC, and in some cases, mAbs can be further engineered to alter their Fc binding to enhance cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Complement activation can have both agonistic and antagonistic effects on CDC and ADCC, and it is unclear which mechanisms are most responsible for eliminating malignant cells. Target cell killing can also be enhanced by using the antibody as a vehicle to deliver a toxin or cytotoxic drug directly to the target cell using an mAb-drug or mAb-toxin conjugate. (See <a href=\"#H2737109246\" class=\"local\">'Drug or toxin conjugation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Fc receptors are expressed on lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Fc receptors can be engineered to bind specific receptors on subpopulations of cells or to have specific glycoprotein modifications. The properties of the Fc portion can vary depending on antibody isotype (eg, immunoglobulin G [IgG], IgA, or IgM). Most therapeutic mAbs are IgG1, which has been well-characterized for its half-life and effector functions, including complement fixation. The Fc portion may bind complement C1q and activate the classical pathway of the complement cascade, or it may bind to receptors on antigen-presenting cells, leading to phagocytosis. The Fc portion can activate or suppress B cells, depending on the antigen and timing of interactions.</p><p/><p>Investigational approaches are being tested for the generation of mAbs against intracellular proteins, which could potentially greatly expand the available targets and methods of cell killing. Examples include engineering mAbs to be internalized by endosomal pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Additional information about specific Fc receptors on various cell types and mechanisms of complement activation and phagocytosis are discussed in other topic reviews.

In addition, mAbs rapidly distribute beyond the intravascular space, so the amount of mAb removed by plasmapheresis is a fraction of the total tissue-distributed and target-bound mAb. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-treatment-of-refractory-or-relapsed-disease#H19007405\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Treatment of refractory or relapsed disease&quot;, section on 'Rituximab'</a>.)</p><p>In other cases, removal of the mAb by plasmapheresis may be a desired effect. An example is an individual who has an adverse effect from an mAb such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a>; this may be reversed by performing plasmapheresis to decrease the concentration of natalizumab and restore immune effector function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natalizumab for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If plasmapheresis is inadvertently performed immediately after administration of a therapeutic mAb, the treating clinician must decide whether it is necessary to administer another dose of the mAb or wait until the next scheduled dose. Often extra doses are not given. Factors to consider include the disease severity, number of doses administered previously, and time interval between administration of the mAb and initiation of the plasmapheresis procedure. In many cases, the sufficient quantities of the mAb may have reached their intended target despite removal of some of the antibodies during the plasmapheresis procedure.</p><p>In contrast to plasmapheresis, which removes plasma proteins, hemodialysis does not remove mAbs from the circulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3954492872\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EVENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>mAbs are made using recombinant biotechnology. Thus, they do not carry infectious risks associated with polyclonal antibody preparations from human plasma. However, they are biologic products and can elicit a number of immune-mediated and other reactions and adverse events (AEs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thus, these therapies should not be prescribed without the requisite expertise in their use and appropriate facilities for treating potentially serious reactions. Individuals treated with mAb-based therapies should be made aware of potential AEs and given instructions to follow and contact information should they occur. The prescribing information for the specific mAb should be consulted for a complete list of AEs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1744751947\"><span class=\"h2\">Infusion reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infusion reactions are reactions that typically occur in the first one to two hours of starting an infusion. They can occur in response to biologic therapies such as mAbs as well as to other systemic therapies. They can affect any organ system and can range from mildly irritating injection-site reactions, increases in body temperature, or pruritus, to potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis. Mild reactions are common.</p><p>The immunogenicity of mAbs derived from nonhuman species can lead to the development of anti-mAb antibodies, which are sometimes associated with acute hypersensitivity reactions. While the majority of anti-mAb antibodies are immunoglobulin G (IgG) and can limit the availability and half-life of the drug, those of the IgE isotype can also mediate immediate swelling and anaphylaxis after repeated exposures. Strategies such as desensitization to modify these adverse reactions have been tried. Many times these acute hypersensitivity reactions can be confused with cytokine release syndromes (CRS), which are largely dependent on the amount and type of target cell rather than the characteristics of the therapeutic mAb. (See <a href=\"#H2241591747\" class=\"local\">'Cytokine release syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>The management of infusion reactions depends on the severity of the reaction and the urgency needed for treatment of the underlying condition. Mild reactions can often be managed by early recognition and prompt intervention. Often, the mAb can be continued after temporarily stopping it; use of a slower infusion rate or concomitant therapy with antipyretics or antihistamines may be helpful. Information specific to the disorder being treated should be consulted.</p><p>A separate discussion of infusion reactions to mAbs used to treat hematologic malignancies and solid tumors includes additional information about reactions to specific antibodies, along with recommendations for management, prevention, rechallenge, and desensitization.
