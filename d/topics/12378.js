Enteric fistulas are abnormal connections between the gastrointestinal tract and other abdominal organs, chest, or skin. Symptoms associated with fistulas depend on whether the fistula is proximal (eg, stomach, jejunum) or distal (eg, ileum, colon) and may include diarrhea for entero-colonic or enteroenteric fistulas; urinary tract infections for fistulas to the urinary system; or external drainage of enteric contents for enterocutaneous or entero-atmospheric fistulas. </p><p>The treatment of fistulas requires optimization of nutrition and healing potential, and definitive surgical treatment, when indicated. Many enteric fistulas may heal spontaneously. Nonoperative interventions such as endoscopic or interventional radiology can be used for temporary or definitive management of fistulas. During evaluation, a thorough consideration of the etiology of the fistula, removal of precipitating factors, optimization of nutritional status, and primary treatment of fistulas should occur. Up to 25 percent of mortality from fistulas occurs as a result of infection and sepsis related to complications from fistulas. Additional mortality is often due to fluid and nutritional losses secondary to uncontrolled fistula output. Immediate surgery may be required in the setting of uncontrolled sepsis. </p><p>An overview of the clinical features, diagnosis and management of enteric fistulas is reviewed here. Other enteric fistulas, including pancreatic fistulas, are introduced briefly below, but reviewed in more detail in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic fistulas: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-fistulas-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic fistulas: Management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urogenital-tract-fistulas-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urogenital tract fistulas in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectovaginal-and-anovaginal-fistulas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectovaginal and anovaginal fistulas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorectal-fistula-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorectal fistula: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management principles&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21348973\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A fistula is an abnormal communication between two structures. </p><p>Enteric fistulas can be classified as internal or external depending upon whether they drain externally to the skin or internally to the gastrointestinal tract or other organ (eg, bladder, vagina). Enteric fistulas are also classified with respect to the anatomic segments of bowel (ie, other organs or vascular structures) that are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The origin of the fistula is also important in diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper intestinal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonic </p><p/><p>The specific designation of enteric fistulas is based upon the segment of bowel or other organ from which it originates (gastro-, duodeno-, entero-, jejuno-, ileo-, colo-, recto-, chole-) and the point of termination (-cutaneous, -enteric, -colonic, -rectal, -vesical, -vaginal, -aortic). However, at initial presentation, the specific segment of bowel involved is often unknown and the broader designation (eg, enterocutaneous rather than jejunocutaneous) can be used until the anatomy of the fistula can be delineated. (See <a href=\"#H21348536\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Enteric fistulas are also classified with respect to the output of the fistula. The physiologic consequences of enterocutaneous fistulas depend upon the composition of the fistula drainage, which differs for proximal versus distal intestinal fistulas, and volume of the fistula. The physiologic classification of enterocutaneous is as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low output fistula drains less than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A moderate output fistula drains between 200 and 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high output fistula drains more than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span></p><p/><p>Fistulas associated with Crohn disease are classified as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 &ndash; no evidence of active disease </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 &ndash; more complex fistulas associated with intraabdominal abscesses </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21348418\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although various etiologies can lead to enteric fistula formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76953 \">table 1</a>), many fistulas occur in the postoperative setting. Approximately 20 to 30 percent of all enterocutaneous fistulas arise in the setting of Crohn disease (spontaneous, following bowel resection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults#H12689057\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Fistulas'</a>.)</p><p>The etiologic classification is based on the underlying disease process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mnemonic &quot;FRIEND&quot; describes common etiologies for fistulas which include foreign body, radiation, inflammation or infection (eg, tuberculosis, actinomycosis), epithelialization, neoplasia, and distal obstruction. Enteric fistulas may also be the result of iatrogenic injury during surgery or traumatic injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21348455\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative fistulas are the result of bowel injury during surgery, a leak from a bowel anastomosis, missed enterotomy or erosion of foreign material into adjacent bowel (eg, mesh for hernia repair, vascular graft) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Preoperative factors that increase the likelihood of the development of a fistula include malnutrition, immunosuppression, traumatic injury, infection, and emergency procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21348467\"><span class=\"h3\">Open abdomen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The increasingly common practice of damage control and leaving the abdomen open for those at risk for abdominal compartment syndrome after trauma or emergency surgery has led to the emergence of a particularly difficult to manage fistula, the enteroatmospheric (exposed) fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the open abdomen in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Entero-atmospheric or exposed fistulas occur in the midst of an open abdomen with no overlying soft tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58058\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58058 \">picture 1</a>). These are one of the most difficult complications of &quot;damage control&quot; laparotomy and are a source of significant morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Entero-atmospheric fistula is classified on the basis of the surrounding abdominal wound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A superficial exposed fistula drains atop the granulating wound of a frozen abdomen (densely adherent intestines and other abdominal organs, also called fused visceral block) with an obliterated peritoneal cavity, and primarily represents a wound management and nutritional support problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A deep exposed fistula drains intestinal contents directly into the peritoneal cavity, causing peritonitis, and is characterized by uncontrolled infection. This may require emergent surgical intervention. </p><p/><p>A review of 517 patients from the American Association for Surgery in Trauma (AAST) registry with open abdomen found that independent risk factors for enterocutaneous fistula, entero-atmospheric fistula, and intraabdominal sepsis included large bowel resection, large-volume resuscitation, and an increasing number of abdominal re-explorations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78564496\"><span class=\"h2\">Neoplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient with a new primary fistula, without known medical risk factors or prior surgery, consideration of a neoplastic process should occur.

Depending upon the location and origin of the fistula, this may be drainage through a prior abdominal wound, the development of diarrhea or fecaluria, or gastrointestinal bleeding. It is important to first assess the stability of the patient and determine the need for emergent surgical intervention. If the fistula output can be controlled and there are no signs of peritonitis, or uncontrolled sepsis, then initial evaluation should include imaging to determine the source and etiology of the fistula. (See <a href=\"#H21348536\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14456075\" class=\"local\">'Indications for fistula resection'</a> below.)</p><p>The most common presentation of an enteric fistula is that of an enterocutaneous fistula in a postoperative patient who fails to recover normally from abdominal surgery. The patient may exhibit abdominal discomfort, distension and tenderness, a low grade fever, or signs of abdominal sepsis. Most typically, a wound infection is recognized 7 to 10 days postoperatively, and following incisional drainage, enteric contents appear in the surgical wound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>A superficial enteroatmospheric fistula can occur suddenly after injury to, or desiccation of, a loop of exposed bowel, or it can evolve gradually as the open abdominal wound heals around a deep fistula that has been effectively controlled. Enterocutaneous fistulas and entero-atmospheric fistulas (particularly those deep to the open abdominal surface) can be associated with intraabdominal infection, either as a contained infection (intraabdominal abscess) or with generalized peritonitis. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting, obstipation and other symptoms and signs of bowel obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic signs such as fever, chills or end-organ dysfunction, and even multisystem organ failure. These features can also be present in patients with internal pancreatic fistulas as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic fistulas: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Internal fistulas'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical presentation of other types of enteric fistula depends upon the segment of intestine or other organs affected. Complaints may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea &ndash; Fistula between the proximal small bowel and distal bowel, or biliary tree and small bowel. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passage of air in the urine (pneumaturia) recurrent urinary tract infections, or stool per the vagina &ndash; Colovesical fistula, colorectal fistula, colovaginal fistula.

Gallstone ileus can occur if a gallstone erodes into the adjacent small bowel leading to obstruction.

For pancreatic fistulas, the diagnosis relies on the demonstration of an amylase level in the drainage that is greater than three times the upper limit of the normal serum value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-fistulas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic fistulas: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen with and without oral and intravenous contrast is the initial study for patients suspected of having an enteric fistula. CT may demonstrate the anatomy of the fistula and may also demonstrate associated intraabdominal abscess, other fluid collections, areas of distal intestinal obstruction, or pneumobilia in the case of gallbladder fistulas. In patients with suspected enteric fistula for whom the diagnosis is in doubt, or anatomic detail provided by abdominal CT is not adequate, a gastrointestinal contrast study (small bowel follow-through or contrast enema, depending upon the suspected level of the fistula) may demonstrate the fistula. Alternatively, for enterocutaneous fistula that has a well-defined cutaneous opening, in the absence of sepsis, a fistulogram can document intestinal continuity, and evaluate for distal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/4,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,12</a>]. However, the fistulogram rarely identifies the specific origin of the tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The fistulogram is performed by injecting a water soluble contrast agent into the opening to first define the fistula tract. Subsequently, a guidewire can be used to place an angiographic catheter using fluoroscopic guidance to further define with additional contrast injections any associated pockets or cavities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Small fistulas may not be apparent on imaging. A simple method to determine whether or not an enteric fistula is indeed present is by the administration of dye (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, charcoal), which can be injected intravenously, ingested or added to enteric feeding, or instilled as a solution into the bladder or rectum using a catheter or during endoscopy. The appearance of blue staining in wound drainage, urine, feces, or from the vagina confirms that an enteric fistula is present, but provides no further information. The subsequent diagnosis of urogenital or rectal fistulas may require examination under anesthesia to visually confirm the presence of a fistulous tract using probes. Endoscopic evaluation of both vagina and rectum can also help elucidate the source of the fistula. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urogenital-tract-fistulas-in-women#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urogenital tract fistulas in women&quot;, section on 'Cystoscopy and imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21348543\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drainage from an abdominal incision following gastrointestinal surgery may represent a surgical site infection rather than enteric fistula. The character of the drainage, and lack of persistence of the drainage once the wound has been opened, usually makes the distinction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wound infection following repair of abdominal wall hernia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Inflammatory processes that result in localized gastrointestinal perforation may initially present as an intraabdominal abscess, which may not be associated with an enteric fistula. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-tract-perforation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal tract perforation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Internal fistulas that present with diarrhea are generally associated with predisposing factors (eg, prior surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, history of radiation therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. However, diarrhea due to spontaneous fistula without predisposing factors may need to be distinguished from other causes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18524895\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial treatment of enteric fistulas focuses on the correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, treatment of infection, abscess drainage (if needed), nutritional support, and for external fistulas (including pancreatic), control of the effluent drainage and skin care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57027\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57027 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H320290\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aggressive correction of hypovolemia and electrolyte loss should occur early in treatment. Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality. Ongoing fluid losses from high-output upper gastrointestinal fistulas should be replaced with isotonic saline and potassium supplementation with serial measurements of serum electrolytes. High-output fistulas may require electrolyte analysis of the fistula effluent to make an appropriate choice of fluid replacement. Repleting fluid losses cc per cc may be necessary to help prevent dehydration and hypovolemia.

Drainage is usually performed through the anterior abdominal wall. However, abscesses deep in the pelvis or obscured by other organs may be accessed with a variety of approaches, including transgastric, transrectal, transvaginal, and transgluteal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The drainage catheter is usually left in place until drainage is less than 10 mL in 24 hours, which may take as long as 30 days. Catheter fistulograms during this period permit assessment of resolution of the abscess cavity. Surgical intervention is needed if improvement does not occur.

A systematic review identified eight trials and found that somatostatin analogues decrease the duration of enterocutaneous fistulas (weighted mean difference [WMD] -6.37 days, 95% CI -8.33 to -4.42) and duration of hospital stay (WMD -4.53 days, 95% CI -8.29 to -0.77) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Octreotide may adversely affect immune function as a result of growth hormone inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], but there are no clinical data to confirm this possibility. It is also important to keep in mind that if the patient has one of the barriers to spontaneous closure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76451\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76451 \">table 3</a>), such as distal obstruction, octreotide will be futile and will delay the surgical procedure ultimately needed to obtain definitive closure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14457509\"><span class=\"h2\">Negative pressure wound therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no large studies comparing negative pressure wound therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63582\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63582 \">picture 2</a>) with traditional drainage bags, the use of negative pressure wound therapy in fistula management has become widespread because surgeons are familiar with the technology from its successful application to other problematic wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Negative pressure wound therapy may accelerate fistula closure by promoting wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=negative-pressure-wound-therapy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Negative pressure wound therapy&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of action'</a>.)</p><p>Negative pressure wound therapy can also simplify management of enteroatmospheric fistula. Continuous suction of the fistula output minimizes contact time between intestinal fluid and exposed peritoneum, thus effectively controlling intestinal spillage. A useful technique for superficial enteroatmospheric fistula(s) is to intubate the fistula(s) and bring the tubes out perpendicularly through the sponge of the negative pressure dressing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50588\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50588 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. With this technique, the majority of intestinal effluent is collected in the tubes. The sponge serves as a stable rig that anchors the tubes, prevents dislodgement, and collects any residual fluid that might leak around the tubes. A study of vacuum-assisted wound management of 179 fistulas in 91 patients reported spontaneous closure in 46 percent within 90 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Thereafter, the fistula drainage should be controlled, fecal stream diverted, and the abdominal wound allowed to granulate and heal around the fistula in anticipation of definitive closure at a later time. Most patients with deep enteroatmospheric fistula will not have any option for early fistula closure. Because superficial enteroatmospheric (exposed) fistulas will <strong>not</strong> heal spontaneously due to the absence of overlying soft tissue, surgery will be needed to cover the exposed bowel. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6055893\"><span class=\"h3\">Superficial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct local closure can be attempted, but in most cases, superficial entero-atmospheric fistula will require placement of skin grafts to the surrounding granulation tissue to allow placement of a stoma appliance.

This entails very limited dissection to define the edges of the fistula opening, followed by extraperitoneal two-layer suture repair of the hole in the bowel on the surface of the granulating abdominal wound. The key principle is to cover the suture line with a biological dressing (autogenous or cadaveric skin graft, or acellular dermal matrix), with or without a tissue adhesive. Although the procedure may not be successful approximately half the time, this is a local, low-risk procedure that can be easily repeated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/41,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversion of the fistula into a controlled stoma &ndash; If local closure fails, coverage of the granulating wound surrounding the fistula will generally be necessary to provide stable wound coverage for fitting a stoma appliance or for using a negative-pressure wound dressing to control fistula output.

Tube drainage of the deep, enteroatmospheric fistula is not practical or useful and may result in an enlarged opening with intestinal contents leaking around the tube.</p><p>The creation of a &quot;floating stoma&quot; can gradually convert a deep enteroatmospheric fistula into a superficial fistula over a period of several weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. To create a floating stoma the edge of the hole in the gut is sutured to a similar-sized hole tailored in a plastic sheet that serves as a temporary abdominal closure device and separates the intestinal drainage from the open peritoneum. An ostomy bag can then be applied to the plastic sheet around the improvised stoma, protecting the peritoneal cavity and allowing the wound to granulate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14456328\"><span class=\"h1\">FISTULA CLOSURE WITH CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous closure rates vary depending upon the cause and volume of the fistula.

Given that enteroatmospheric fistula is an exposed hole in the bowel lumen without overlying skin or soft tissue, it is not surprising that there should be no realistic expectation of spontaneous closure. </p><p>Approximately one-third of enterocutaneous fistulas will close spontaneously within five to six weeks with conservative measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. Generally low output, long track, and proximal small bowel are most likely to heal with conservative measures. In one retrospective review of 79 patients with enterocutaneous fistula, spontaneous closure occurred in 23 (29 percent) after a median of 39 days (range 7 to 163) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Although the timing of definitive surgery to close the fistula is a matter of judgment, once it has been determined that the fistula is not likely to resolve on its own, surgery should generally not be undertaken for another few months to lessen the risk for bowel injury. Imaging should be repeated to ensure that fluid collections are drained, and inflammation has resolved. Dense adhesions begin to form in the open abdominal wound after approximately one week of exposure and remain treacherous for at least six to eight weeks. The presence of a fistula is usually associated with a severe inflammatory response that leads to dense adhesions, known as &quot;obliterative peritonitis,&quot; that make early surgery hazardous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/48,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,58</a>]. </p><p>In addition to issues related to adhesion formation, definitive management of an enteroatmospheric fistula should <strong>not</strong> be considered until the skin graft is supple and can be pinched between the thumb and index finger, which signifies the existence of a plane between the graft and underlying bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. This signifies that there is a tissue plane between the skin graft and the gut, facilitating one of the more difficult steps of abdominal wall reconstruction, which is dissection of the skin graft off the bowel. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14456168\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before considering definitive repair of an enteric fistula that has failed to close spontaneously, the patient should be nutritionally replete, free of infection, and have supple soft tissues adjacent to the fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/2,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,60</a>]. Known barriers to fistula closure should be sought and treated prior to, or concurrent with, the fistula surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76451\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76451 \">table 3</a>). Additionally, imaging should be performed to rule out source of distal obstruction, assess for Crohn disease, radiation or other characteristics that increase the likelihood of recurrence.

Most studies are limited to specific populations (eg, patients with inflammatory bowel disease) or limited to specific types of fistula (eg, small-bowel fistulas only). Thus, the surgical approach described below is based primarily upon expert opinion and our clinical experience. The aim of surgery is to eliminate the fistula, which usually requires resection of the segment of bowel that is the origin of the fistula, reestablishment of gastrointestinal continuity, and tension-free closure of the abdomen with well-vascularized soft tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Liberal use of fecal diversion and bowel rest during the postoperative healing should be used. </p><p>Prior to surgery, the surgeon should mark potential stoma sites, particularly in patients with Crohn disease, or diverticular disease and consider placing ureteral stents if colon mobilization is anticipated.

Planning the surgical incision should also take into consideration the potential need for complex abdominal wall reconstruction, such as component separation, which requires that the abdominal wall soft tissue remain well-vascularized.</p><p>Once the incision is made, lysis of adhesions is performed to free the abdominal wall circumferentially from adherent bowel. Several reports have been published describing various techniques for approaching and finally resecting the involved bowel loop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Expert surgeons recommend working laterally first to take down adhesions and deliver the bowel from the side of the abdomen least involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The adhesions are often dense and the dissection should be slow and careful. The surgeon must be prepared to spend hours performing painstaking meticulous adhesiolysis and mobilizing the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract from the ligament of Treitz to the rectum, if necessary, to identify the fistula and approach it safely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is usually not advisable to schedule other major elective operations on the same day because these demanding procedures are often &quot;all-day cases.&quot; </p><p>Several techniques can be used to facilitate the dissection of dense adhesions. We inject isotonic saline into areas of dense adhesions. Others have reported placing an antibiotic soaked (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kanamycin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">kanamycin</a>) sponge on areas of difficult adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Both methods help to reveal the plane between the loops of bowel. Once the affected bowel segment(s) have been resected, a gastrostomy tube and feeding jejunostomy should be placed.

Enteric fistulas communicate between the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract and the skin or other organ such as another segment of intestine, the bladder, vagina, rectum, or a vessel. (See <a href=\"#H18524881\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of enteric fistulas occur in the postoperative setting (includes those related to the open abdomen, vascular surgery). Approximately 20 to 30 percent of enterocutaneous fistulas arise in the setting of Crohn disease (spontaneous, following bowel resection). Other spontaneous enteric fistulas can be due to a variety of other etiologies such as infectious diseases, malignancy, following radiation therapy, perforated duodenal ulcer (duodenal fistula), or vascular infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76953 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21348418\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation and treatment of enteric fistulas depends upon the nature of the connection and the presence of complicating factors, which may indicate the need for immediate surgery. Typical clinical symptoms of external fistulas include wound drainage, and variable amounts of abdominal discomfort. Other symptoms related to enteric fistula include diarrhea, abnormal passage of air in the urine or via the vagina, symptoms of small bowel obstruction, or gastrointestinal bleeding (enteric communication with a vessel). (See <a href=\"#H21348503\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of external fistulas may be obvious based upon the appearance of fistula exit site and character of enteric contents in the wound; however, a definitive diagnosis is made by demonstrating the abnormal connection between the bowel and skin, or for internal fistulas, bowel-to-bowel or other organs, usually via imaging or endoscopy. We suggest computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen as the initial study for patients suspected to have an enteric fistula. Other methods of identifying and characterizing enteric fistulas include gastrointestinal contrast studies, instillation of dye (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, charcoal), endoscopy, and examination under anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H21348536\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial treatment of enteric fistulas focuses on fluid therapy to correct volume and electrolyte deficits, treatment of infection, which may include drainage of intraabdominal abscess, correction of malnutrition, and controlling drainage from external fistulas. Approximately one-third of enterocutaneous fistulas heal spontaneously with these measures. Patients who do not respond to conservative measures will require surgical management and should be referred to a center capable of providing complex multidisciplinary care. (See <a href=\"#H18524895\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike enterocutaneous fistulas, enteroatmospheric fistulas will not heal spontaneously because of the absence of overlying soft tissue. Immediate surgery is indicated for patients with a deep enteroatmospheric fistula to contain spillage of enteric contents and managing peritonitis. Drainage from superficial or deep fistulas is controlled until skin grafts can be applied to the granulation bed to allow bag drainage of the stoma(s). Definitive surgical closure of the fistula should <strong>not</strong> be considered until the skin graft is supple and can be pinched between the thumb and index finger, which signifies the existence of a plane between the graft and underlying bowel. (See <a href=\"#H21349702\" class=\"local\">'Controlling external fistula output'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14456183\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of definitive surgery are to resect the fistula, reestablish gastrointestinal continuity, and provide a tension-free closure of the abdomen with well-vascularized soft tissue. Before consideration of definitive repair of fistulas that fail to close spontaneously, patients should be nutritionally replete, free of infection, and have supple soft tissues adjacent to the fistula. (See <a href=\"#H14456183\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H532042641\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate, Inc. would like to acknowledge Dr. William Schecter, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-enteric-fistulas/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Berry SM, Fischer JE.
