This genetic abnormality results in the formation of a unique gene product (BCR-ABL1), which is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that causes CML. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target BCR-ABL1 effectively treat CML. However, a small percentage of patients progresses from the relatively indolent chronic stable phase of CML to a more aggressive accelerated phase, which may culminate in blast crisis, an acute leukemia that is generally refractory to treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of CML with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) will be discussed here; autologous HCT is rarely utilized in this setting. Other treatments options for CML are presented separately.

Ultimately, decisions regarding transplant eligibility should be made on a case-by-case basis based on a risk-benefit assessment and the needs and wishes of the patient. General eligibility criteria are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment decisions require extensive consultation between the patient and a physician highly knowledgeable about the different treatment options. Determining whether the patient has an HLA-matched sibling or initiating an unrelated donor search is warranted early in the course of therapy to determine which options are available. Since only 25 percent of siblings will be HLA matched, and it often takes several months to identify an unrelated donor, anticipating the next potential therapeutic intervention in CML patients is important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258923027\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy and toxicity</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359933444\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial trials in the 1980s demonstrated that CML could be effectively treated with myeloablative chemoradiotherapy followed by syngeneic (identical twin) HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A significant percentage of these patients achieved long-term remission and cure of their disease. However, the advantage of avoiding graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with syngeneic transplantation was counterbalanced by an increased incidence of relapse, which was one of the initial observations leading to the concept of a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. In one series that compared the outcome of 103 syngeneic and 1030 HLA-matched sibling transplants in patients with leukemia, the patients with CML who received a syngeneic transplant had a much higher three-year rate of relapse (40 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of the graft-versus-tumor effect following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Using HLA-matched sibling donors, 50 to 85 percent of patients with CML transplanted in first or second chronic phase of their disease achieve long-term remissions and cure of their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. The percentage of patients achieving a long-term remission falls to 30 to 40 percent in patients transplanted in accelerated phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>] and to 5 to 15 percent of patients in blast crisis. </p><p>The ability of allogeneic HCT to cure CML is related to the antileukemic effects of both the conditioning regimen and the GVL effect of the donor lymphocytes. As such, myeloablative conditioning regimens are expected to result in higher rates of long-term remission and better disease control than nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning regimens. However, this has never been formally tested, and our experience suggests that patients treated with nonmyeloablative conditioning can also have excellent outcomes. However, allogeneic HCT is associated with an upfront mortality risk of 5 to 20 percent, making the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) more attractive as upfront therapies given their low rates of short-term mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H258923104\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258923548\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the invariable progression of the disease, allogeneic HCT has been widely used for patients with CML. Historically, the results obtained with this modality are directly related to the phase of disease at the time of the transplant; among patients in chronic phase, transplantation within the first year results in the best outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/3,4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,9</a>]. However, with the introduction of TKIs, the majority of patients are treated with one of these agents, and transplantation is only considered for patients who have failed this treatment modality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase after failure of initial therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Allogeneic HCT is generally reserved for patients with inadequate control of chronic phase CML despite initial treatment with a TKI, for patients who are intolerant of these drugs, or as an adjunctive treatment for patients who present with more advanced disease (accelerated phase or blast crisis). For patients with advanced disease, the aim of initial management is to revert to chronic phase with plans to proceed with allogeneic HCT in chronic phase, if possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258923104\"><span class=\"h3\">Morbidity and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allogeneic HCT can achieve excellent long-term control of CML, particularly in patients under the age of 50 who are transplanted in chronic phase within one year of diagnosis. However, as with all allogeneic transplants, there is considerable up-front risk due to toxicity, infection, and GVHD. Mortality risk in the first 100 days following transplantation is in the range of 10 to 20 percent for ideal transplant candidates with fully HLA-matched sibling donors; comorbid conditions increase this risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipient-in-the-immediate-post-transplant-period#H599725\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the hematopoietic cell transplant recipient in the immediate post-transplant period&quot;, section on 'Estimating mortality risk'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H24292831\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Risk assessment scoring systems'</a>.)</p><p>Survivors of HCT have a higher prevalence of long-term health-related complications. However, significant morbidity is uncommon; chronic GVHD is the most important predictor of adverse medical late effects and poor overall health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

However, the majority of patients still have detectable disease using sensitive PCR-based techniques. Therefore, careful monitoring is required in patients who would otherwise be candidates for allogeneic HCT. There are no trials comparing TKIs to allogeneic HCT in patients who would otherwise be candidates for transplantation. In addition, the impact of prior treatment with a TKI on HCT outcomes is thought to be minimal, although information on this point is limited.

Initial reports have not found adverse outcomes and suggest that there may be a benefit to tumor load reduction with a TKI prior to HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-18</a>]. This is principally supported by two observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important prognostic factor for survival following HCT for CML is the disease phase at the time of transplantation.

A variety of different T cell depletion techniques have been used; they generally result in less GVHD, but a higher risk of leukemic relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/50-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-54</a>].

For patients without a matched sibling donor, matched unrelated donor HCT is an acceptable alternative. For patients without HLA-matched sibling or unrelated donors, other donor sources have been used. Among the options are haploidentical donors for patients with CML, who are usually in the advanced stages of their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>], and umbilical cord blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. Both options have merits and problems and should be utilized only for patients without a matched related or unrelated donor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An important advance in identifying an unrelated donor has been the development of molecular typing techniques. With the current standard of molecular typing, outcomes for patients undergoing allogeneic HCT with fully matched related and unrelated donors are similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>].</p><p>Because of the relatively indolent nature of CML, there is usually adequate time to perform a search for a matched unrelated donor, which may take up to two to four months, through the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) and other donor agencies.

The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) has compared outcomes using bone marrow versus G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) from unrelated donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The use of bone marrow was associated with lower rates and severity of chronic GVHD, and many centers have utilized this donor source for patients with chronic phase CML who undergo allogeneic HCT with an unrelated donor. For patients with accelerated or blast crisis, mobilized PBPCs may be preferred due to the more robust graft-versus-tumor effects. However, these studies were not specifically performed in CML patients, and results must be inferred from other patient populations.

These donor leukocyte infusions (DLIs) have been extremely effective and provide further direct evidence for a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Patients who do not respond to DLI alone may respond to the addition of interferon alfa. Some groups routinely use both modalities in patients who relapse following HCT.

In a study of 66 consecutive patients with CML relapsing after allogeneic transplant, molecular remission was attained after DLI in 67 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].

Thus, the optimal dose and schedule of DLI continues to be explored. A retrospective study, involving 298 patients treated with DLI at 51 participating centers, indicated that a lower starting dose (&le;0.2 x 10<sup>8</sup> mononuclear <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg)</span> was associated with less GVHD, less myelosuppression, and less DLI-related mortality than higher doses, although subsequent dose escalation was often necessary in order to achieve a response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>An approach to DLI that we have taken based upon these findings is to treat patients initially with 10<sup>7</sup> T <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> for those with cytogenetic or persistent molecular positive results.

If no response is observed within two to three months then dose escalation of DLI to 3 x 10<sup>7</sup> T <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> and eventually 10<sup>8</sup> T <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> can be pursued.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359933252\"><span class=\"h2\">Tyrosine kinase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should be considered for treatment with a TKI at the time of relapse.

Although definitive data are lacking, it appears that prior treatment with TKIs does not negatively impact outcomes for patients who ultimately proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H359934084\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment with TKIs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCT is a highly effective therapy that can achieve long-term remission in 50 to 85 percent of patients with first or second chronic phase CML, 30 to 40 percent of patients transplanted in accelerated phase, and 5 to 15 percent of patients in blast crisis. However, allogeneic HCT is associated with an upfront mortality risk of 5 to 20 percent. (See <a href=\"#H258923027\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and toxicity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H258924625\" class=\"local\">'Disease phase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCT is generally reserved for eligible patients with inadequate control of chronic phase CML despite initial treatment with a TKI, for individuals who are intolerant of TKIs, or as an adjunctive treatment for patients who present with more advanced disease (accelerated phase or blast crisis). For patients with advanced disease, the aim of initial management is to revert to chronic phase with plans to proceed with allogeneic HCT in chronic phase, if possible. (See <a href=\"#H258923548\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H258925044\" class=\"local\">'Eligibility'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment decisions require extensive consultation between the patient and a physician highly knowledgeable about the different treatment options. Determining whether the patient has an HLA matched sibling or initiating an unrelated donor search is warranted early in the course of therapy to determine which options are available. Since only 25 percent of siblings will be HLA matched and it often takes two to four months to identify an unrelated donor, anticipating the next potential therapeutic intervention in CML patients is important. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Donor selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of studies that have evaluated allogeneic HCT in CML have used myeloablative preparative regimens. These regimens are preferred whenever possible. The preferred myeloablative regimen is intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>. Reduced intensity conditioning or nonmyeloablative HCT regimens are acceptable alternatives to myeloablative conditioning in older patients (&gt;60 years) or those with medical co-morbidities. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Preparative regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is uncertain whether there is any benefit to using a TKI after HCT for patients transplanted for chronic phase CML if a molecular remission has been achieved. Frequent <em>BCR-ABL1</em> minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring is advisable for such patients. For patients transplanted for CML in myeloid or lymphoid blast crisis, we suggest the use of a TKI for two years after allogeneic HCT, if tolerable, rather than postponing its use until the emergence of MRD positivity, especially if nonmyeloablative conditioning is used. (See <a href=\"#H258925375\" class=\"local\">'Is there a role for TKI post-HCT?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following transplant, it is critically important to carefully follow the patient's disease status on a regular basis. We perform quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) of <em>BCR-ABL1</em> transcripts at least every three to six months. A persistent rise in transcript level is associated with an increased risk of relapse. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring MRD post-HCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients are treated with a TKI at the time of relapse. Reduction of immunosuppression and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) should also be incorporated into the initial management of all patients with relapse unless concerns regarding graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) make this approach unfeasible.
