It can be given orally and is mainly used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Very rarely, it has been used as an immunosuppressive agent in refractory autoimmune and inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and sarcoidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-therapy-for-symptomatic-or-advanced-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H1184010879\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial therapy for symptomatic or advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Chlorambucil-based therapy'</a>.) </p><p>Other than myelosuppression, less common side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> involve the gastrointestinal tract, liver, skin, and the central nervous system; lung toxicity is rare but well documented. Chlorambucil-induced pulmonary injury will be discussed here. A more general discussion of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of pulmonary toxicity in patients receiving systemic antineoplastic therapy is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-systemic-antineoplastic-therapy-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary toxicity associated with systemic antineoplastic therapy: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.) &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the pulmonary toxicity of other alkylating agents like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> is well recognized, chlorambucil-induced pulmonary injury is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlorambucil-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Contemporary clinical trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> in over 600 patients with a hematologic malignancy did not identify any cases of chlorambucil-induced pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlorambucil-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. This could be due to the rarity of the phenomenon or to underreporting of events occurring after completion of treatment. </p><p>There are no unifying risk factors. Pulmonary toxicity may develop while the patient is taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>, or after stopping the drug.

Interstitial lung disease may develop while the patient is taking chlorambucil or after stopping it.</p><p>In patients who develop chronic interstitial pneumonitis, symptoms usually develop six months to three years or longer after initiation of therapy; the most common presentation is the insidious onset of cough and dyspnea. Other symptoms may include weight loss, fever, and hemoptysis.

The main role for lung biopsy is to exclude other processes in patients who do not improve after drug cessation.

The diagnosis may be suspected based on a failure to respond to drug cessation or empiric antibiotic therapy. Transbronchial or surgical lung biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlorambucil-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alveolar hemorrhage</strong> &ndash; Alveolar hemorrhage is a potential complication of thrombocytopenia in CLL.

Depending on the acuity of symptoms, empiric antibiotic therapy is often indicated while waiting for the results of diagnostic studies. </p><p>The role of glucocorticoids is unclear, as many patients improve without therapy and mortality seems to be similar in patients regardless of glucocorticoid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlorambucil-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>]. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> lung toxicity has been reported in patients who were receiving combination therapy that included glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlorambucil-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The following represents our approach which is based upon the severity of the respiratory impairment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild-to-moderate respiratory impairment</strong> &ndash; Given the limited data, we typically observe stable patients off of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> for a few days before considering glucocorticoid therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Persistent respiratory impairment or severe disease at presentation</strong> &ndash; For patients who do not improve within a few days after stopping <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> or have severe respiratory impairment at presentation, we suggest a trial of systemic glucocorticoids since fatalities are reported, and some anecdotal reports describe success in patients with acute or subacute interstitial lung disease. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Glucocorticoid dosing is empiric. Prednisone-equivalent doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlorambucil-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal duration of glucocorticoids for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> lung toxicity is not known. If the patient improves with glucocorticoid therapy, tapering of the oral dose can be carried out over one to two months, as tolerated. Ongoing monitoring is needed as systemic glucocorticoid therapy is associated with a number of adverse effects, including opportunistic infection and hyperglycemia. For patients who do not improve after two to four weeks of glucocorticoid therapy, we taper more quickly to reduce adverse effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary fibrosis</strong> &ndash; The role of glucocorticoids for patients with evidence of interstitial fibrosis is less clear, as fibrosis is not glucocorticoid responsive. For patients with high resolution computed tomography findings of honeycombing and coarse linear opacities, a brief trial of glucocorticoids may be reasonable, in case a component of reversible pneumonitis is present. </p><p/><p>Supportive measures such as supplemental oxygen and vaccination to prevent infection are employed, as indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall prognosis of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> lung toxicity is variable, but fatalities are common. In case reports, approximately 50 percent of patients have died despite withdrawal of the drug and treatment with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlorambucil-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/2,4,6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,6,8,9</a>]. In a systematic review of 18 literature reports of chlorambucil lung toxicity, seven patients expired, although whether the death was directly attributed to lung damage and whether glucocorticoid therapy was administered were not always reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlorambucil-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Many of the fatal cases seem to have developed pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlorambucil-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/2,6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,12</a>]. </p><p>This emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion and early withdrawal of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> once lung toxicity is suspected.</p><p>Recurrent episodes of acute respiratory distress with subsequent exposures to the drug have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlorambucil-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/4,12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,16</a>].
