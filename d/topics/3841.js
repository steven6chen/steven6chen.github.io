The genus <em>Ebolavirus</em> consists of five species: Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo, Tai Forest, and Reston. </p><p>The Zaire species was discovered in 1976, and has been responsible for some dozen outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries, with case fatality rates often approaching 90 percent. In 2014, the Zaire virus appeared in West Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], producing an epidemic in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone that took more than two years to bring under control. There were nearly 29,000 total cases (suspected, probable, or confirmed), of which more than 15,000 were laboratory confirmed, and the overall case fatality rate was approximately 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The Sudan species was also first recognized in 1976, and in four outbreaks in Uganda and Sudan, case fatality rates have averaged 50 percent. The Bundibugyo species has been responsible for small outbreaks in Uganda and the adjacent DRC, while the Ivory Coast virus has caused one nonfatal case. The Reston virus does not cause disease in humans. </p><p>Epidemics of Ebola virus disease are generally thought to begin when an individual becomes infected through contact with the body fluids of an infected animal. Once the individual becomes ill or dies, the virus spreads to others who come into direct contact with their blood or other body fluids. On rare occasions, Ebola virus disease has resulted from accidental laboratory infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and there is concern that the virus might be used as an agent of bioterrorism.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebola virus disease will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of this disease are discussed elsewhere.

Infection control precautions should also be used for patients whose risk of exposure is unclear at the time of their initial presentation until a medical evaluation can be performed. (See <a href=\"#H448916757\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients with identifiable risk'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease#H1056044081\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease&quot;, section on 'Infection control precautions during acute illness'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persons under investigation for Ebola virus disease should undergo testing for Ebola virus by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) facilitated by local and state health officials. Specific details regarding laboratory testing are found below.

The PPE used when caring for patients whose condition is associated with a high risk of direct contact with body fluids (eg, presence of vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding) are different from those used when evaluating a patient who does not present a hazard due to body fluid exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>].

In one study that evaluated 770 ill nonimmigrant travelers returning from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone during a five-year period (September 2009 through August 2014), malaria was the most common diagnosis (40 percent), followed by acute diarrhea (12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. </p><p>The differential diagnosis depends, in part, upon the individual's symptoms, where they have traveled or resided, if they have had close contact with someone who is ill, their vaccination history, and their age and comorbid conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/21,30,89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,30,89-91</a>]. Since most patients suspected of possible Ebola virus disease will have travelled to <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reside in West or Central Africa, the following disorders should be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Malaria</strong> &ndash; Travelers who develop a febrile illness after returning from West or Central Africa should be evaluated for malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Malaria can present with similar findings to Ebola virus disease and may occur concurrently. Microscopic examination of blood smears <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rapid antigen testing are typically used to diagnose malaria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of malaria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lassa fever</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Lassa fever is a viral infection restricted to West Africa, though imported cases have been seen in the United States. Although symptoms may be mild, approximately 20 percent of patients develop a severe clinical syndrome that can progress to fatal shock. Transmission to humans occurs primarily through exposure to the aerosolized excretions of local rodents (ie, multimammate rats), or in rare cases, through contact with body fluids of infected individuals. Diagnosis is made by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

The organism responsible for the enteric fever syndrome is <em>Salmonella enterica</em> serotype Typhi (formerly <em>S. typhi</em>). Worldwide, typhoid fever is most prevalent in impoverished areas that are overcrowded, with poor access to sanitation. The diagnosis is typically made through identification of the organism in blood cultures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of enteric (typhoid and paratyphoid) fever&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Meningococcal disease</strong> &ndash; Patients with meningococcal disease can present with meningitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bacteremia, and certain signs and symptoms (headache, fever) may overlap with those seen in Ebola virus disease. Cultures of blood or cerebrospinal fluid are used to make the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Neisseria meningitidis infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of meningococcal infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Influenza</strong> &ndash; Influenza often presents with the abrupt onset of fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise, similar to the presenting signs and symptoms of Ebola virus disease. However, with influenza, these manifestations are often accompanied by respiratory signs and symptoms, such as nonproductive cough, sore throat, and nasal discharge, which are not typically part of the Ebola syndrome. Direct fluorescent antibody or other rapid assays are used to diagnose influenza. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of seasonal influenza in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of seasonal influenza in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Measles</strong> &ndash; The prodrome phase of measles and the initial stage of Ebola virus disease are similar and are characterized by fever, malaise, and anorexia. However, in measles, this prodrome is followed by conjunctivitis, coryza, and cough, as well as a characteristic maculopapular, blanching rash that begins on the face. The diagnosis of measles is typically established via antibody or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measles: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Marburg virus disease</strong> &ndash; Marburg virus causes clinical manifestations similar to Ebola virus disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=marburg-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Marburg virus&quot;</a>). Cases have been identified in Central Africa, but not in West Africa. The diagnosis is typically made by RT-PCR testing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Travelers' diarrhea</strong> &ndash; Travelers' diarrhea develops during or within 10 days of returning from travel, most commonly to resource-limited countries or regions. Patients typically present with malaise, anorexia, and abdominal cramps, followed by the sudden onset of diarrhea. Nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever may also occur. When attempting to distinguish between travelers' diarrhea and diarrhea that occurs in Ebola virus disease, clinicians should note whether the condition appears to be part of a systemic illness or is mostly confined to the gastrointestinal tract. A patient who develops diarrhea in the setting of Ebola virus disease is likely to have a several-day history of fever, myalgia, fatigue, and other signs of a rapidly progressive systemic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Travelers' diarrhea: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Additional topic reviews that discuss the evaluation of an ill returning traveler are found elsewhere.

In the case of a bioterror attack, patients with no history of travel to Central or West Africa or other possible exposure to an infected animal or an Ebola patient would develop Ebola virus disease and would be seen in doctors' offices or hospital emergency departments. The appearance of multiple patients with a similar, rapidly progressive illness would be especially suggestive of bioterrorism. Any clinician suspecting that such an event is unfolding should report it promptly to local and state health authorities. General concepts regarding bioterrorism are discussed elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incubation period is typically 6 to 12 days, but can range from 2 to 21 days. (See <a href=\"#H134397\" class=\"local\">'Incubation period'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Ebola virus disease usually have an abrupt onset of nonspecific symptoms and signs, such as fever, malaise, headache, and myalgias. As the illness progresses, vomiting and diarrhea may develop, often leading to significant fluid loss. Patients with worsening disease display hypotension and electrolyte imbalances leading to shock and multiorgan failure, sometimes accompanied by hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F99186\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99186 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H134474\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether Ebola virus disease is considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with fever and flu-like symptoms will vary markedly depending upon the circumstances, in particular whether a recognized Ebola epidemic is currently taking place. For patients with clinical findings consistent with the disease (ie, fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe headache, weakness, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or unexplained hemorrhage), clinicians should obtain a careful history to determine if they have had a possible exposure to Ebola virus within 21 days prior to the onset of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H150254047\" class=\"local\">'Determining the risk of exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients who have or are suspected of having Ebola virus disease should be promptly isolated. Infection control precautions should include hand hygiene; standard, contact, and droplet precautions; as well as the correct use of appropriate personal protective equipment. Hospital infection control staff, as well as the local or state health department, should be contacted immediately. (See <a href=\"#H448916757\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients with identifiable risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring for symptoms and signs of Ebola virus disease should be performed for asymptomatic persons who have had an exposure to Ebola virus at any risk level (ie, high, moderate, or low risk). (See <a href=\"#H523732030\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic individuals with identifiable risk'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical evaluation of symptomatic patients with a history of exposure generally includes testing for Ebola virus and other likely pathogens. Whether laboratory testing for Ebola virus should be performed depends, in part, upon the relative likelihood that a patient was exposed to the virus and the presence of compatible clinical symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory findings. (See <a href=\"#H381319109\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic tests for Ebola virus infection are principally based upon the detection of specific RNA sequences by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in blood or other body fluids. Ebola virus is generally detectable in blood samples within three days after the onset of symptoms; repeat testing may be needed for patients with symptoms for fewer than three days duration. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic tests'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis will vary markedly with the clinical and epidemiologic circumstances. As an example, travelers returning from West or Central Africa should be evaluated for illnesses commonly seen in those areas, such as malaria. (See <a href=\"#H430767503\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of its virulence and high infectivity, Ebola virus is classified as a Category A bioterror agent.
