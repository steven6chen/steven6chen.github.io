Abdominal injury from GSWs accounts for up to 90 percent of the mortality associated with penetrating abdominal injuries. Although data is limited, the mortality rate for isolated abdominal GSWs is reported to be approximately 7 percent. Approximately 25 percent of such injuries may be managed non-operatively in appropriate settings. The small bowel is the organ most frequently injured, followed by the colon and liver. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Selective nonoperative management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ballistic wounds can occur from a variety of missiles including bullets, grenades, flying glass, and objects launched by lawn mowers or severe weather. Among such injuries, gunshot wounds (GSWs) to the abdomen most often require operative intervention.</p><p>The velocity of the missile and its distance from the patient are important factors in determining the extent of injury. Medium and high-velocity weapons (such as AK 47s) also cause injury by opening and closing tissue with such force as to create a wave of energy that can damage intraperitoneal structures, despite entirely extraperitoneal tracking of the missile. Projectiles from medium velocity weapons travel 335 to 610 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/second,</span> or 1100 to 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">feet/second,</span> while projectiles from high-velocity weapons travel &gt;610 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/second,</span> or &gt;2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">feet/second</span>.</p><p>Shot gun wounds (SGWs) have different characteristic patterns of injury given their use of pellets, rather than single bullets, and longer barrels. Typically initial pellet velocity decreases quickly and spread increases with distance from the target. Most lethal SGWs occur at close range (&lt;2.7 m; &lt;3 yards). Management of abdominal SGWs does not differ significantly from that of GSWs.</p><p>SGWs are categorized into three types based on distance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I (&gt;6.4 m; &gt;7 yards) wounds are typically limited to the subcutaneous tissue and deep fascial layers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II (2.7 to 6.4 m; 3 to 7 yards) wounds occur when projectiles enter the abdominal cavity due to a tighter pellet spread and increased velocity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III (&lt;2.7 m; &lt;3 yards) wounds result in massive tissue loss and destruction, in addition to added contaminants from debris. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC ZONES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The abdominal cavity is divided into four anatomic zones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64644\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64644 \">figure 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior abdomen &ndash; The anterior abdomen is bound by the anterior axillary lines extending from the costal margins to the groin creases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracoabdominal region &ndash; The nipple line (fourth intercostal space) anteriorly and the tips of the scapulae (seventh intercostal space) and the inferior costal margin posteriorly demarcate the cephalad portion of the thoracoabdominal area. The caudad portion is bound by the inferior costal margin. Wounds in this general region pose significant threat, as injury to the chest, mediastinum, and abdomen are all possible because of the path of the weapon and movement of the diaphragm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flank region &ndash; The flanks are separated on each side by the inferior costal margins and iliac crests, and the anterior and posterior axillary lines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back region &ndash; The back is defined as the area between the posterior axillary lines, the inferior scapular tips (seventh intercostals space), and the iliac crest.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>History should be gathered from the patient if possible, available eye-witnesses, and emergency medical service (EMS) providers.

Issues specifically related to the initial evaluation of patients with abdominal gunshot wounds (GSWs) are discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Indications for immediate laparotomy include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of peritonitis (eg, rigid abdominal wall, rebound tenderness)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension or hemodynamic instability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evisceration of abdominal contents (bowel or omentum)</p><p/><p>Another potential indication is gastrointestinal bleeding indicative of bowel injury, although this indication in isolation is rare after penetrating trauma, and such bleeding may be present for other reasons.</p><p>The management of patients whose abdomen cannot be examined reliably (eg, unresponsive, intoxicated, or intubated patient) varies depending on local expertise and resources, and the preference of the attending trauma surgeon. Immediate laparotomy and diagnostic laparoscopy are both reasonable options.</p><p>All patients must be completely undressed and systematically examined. Often a patient with what appears to be an isolated abdominal gunshot wound has additional wounds in the axilla, groin, perineum, scalp, or skin folds. A rectal examination should be performed in all patients with a GSW involving the lower abdomen, and a genitourinary examination should be performed in all patients with a GSW involving the pelvis. All patients must be log-rolled to evaluate for exit wounds and wounds to the back. Depending on bullet trajectory, ricochets, and associated shrapnel, abdominal GSWs raise concern for intrathoracic injury. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Local wound exploration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GSWs often destroy tissue making local wound exploration less effective for visualizing the extent of the missile tract. Occasionally, local wound exploration may be used to assess superficial tangential wounds, but the clinician must ensure that the entire tract is visualized. If not, additional testing is required. However, in general, and in contrast to abdominal stab wounds, formal wound exploration is <strong>not</strong> performed in patients with GSWs because of the difficulty in following wound tracks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain film radiographs are often employed and generally accurate for determining the path of a bullet and its location. Two planes must be imaged to determine whether the peritoneum was penetrated. Radiographs are less helpful in patients with through-and-through wounds, wounds in which ricochet off of ribs or the pelvis may have occurred, and multiple bullets or pellets. Missiles may enter vessels or travel outside of the peritoneal cavity. In such cases, the number of entry and exit sites will not correspond to the number of missiles found on plain films, compelling the clinician to extend the radiographic search [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This can be done using additional plain radiographs or CT, and the preferred approach will vary by local expertise and resources.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography (CT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The advent of fast, high-resolution multi-detector CT (MDCT) scanners has dramatically expanded the role of CT in the management of abdominal GSWs. IV and oral contrast are often used in patients with GSWs to better visualize solid and hollow viscus injuries. Rectal contrast is added for suspected colorectal injury, based on missile path or clinical findings such as rectal bleeding. In stable patients, this study can be completed expeditiously, making it an excellent test for those who do not need immediate exploratory laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>In one prospective observational study of 100 hemodynamically stable patients with non-tangential abdominal GSWs, researchers found that using abdominal MDCT with IV contrast alone to evaluate for intra-abdominal injury after an abdominal GSW yielded a sensitivity of 90.5 percent and specificity of 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Only 26 of the 100 proceeded to exploratory laparotomy and of those five had a nontherapeutic laparotomy. This suggests that IV contrast-only MDCT coupled with serial physical examination for the evaluation of stable abdominal GSW patients has reasonable accuracy and may be safe and useful.</p><p>In another prospective observational study, 41 patients with abdominal GSWs were initially managed nonoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Of the 24 patients with negative CT findings, none required operation (one went to the OR based on physical exam findings but had a negative laparotomy). Of the remaining 17 with positive CT findings, 11 had a therapeutic laparotomy and one had a nontherapeutic laparotomy. The other positive CT scans showed five hepatic injuries, three of which were managed with angioembolization, and one diaphragmatic injury, which was repaired using video-assisted thoracoscopy.</p><p>Due to advances in MDCT imaging, selective nonoperative management of abdominal GSWs is gaining favor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. CT is helpful for elucidating the missile path, delineating organ and vascular injury, and identifying patients with injuries amenable to nonoperative management (eg, low-grade liver injuries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/5,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Selective nonoperative management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound (US) can be invaluable in the initial evaluation of the unstable trauma patient because it can rapidly determine the presence or absence of blood in the pericardial and peritoneal spaces. However, it cannot rule out intra-abdominal injury, especially injury to the diaphragm or hollow viscus organs, which often bleed minimally when injured. Minimal intra-abdominal fluid identified by US (or CT), without other findings, may be a harbinger of isolated hollow viscus or diaphragmatic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The use of US to evaluate patients with abdominal trauma is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic peritoneal lavage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) in the assessment of abdominal GSWs is extremely limited. The latest generation of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scanners provide high-resolution images with great speed, and has made DPL largely obsolete save for a few special circumstances. As one possible example, DPL might be used to assess a stable patient with an abdominal GSW and suspected internal injuries being evaluated in a small hospital without a CT scanner to determine whether urgent transfer and operative intervention is required. DPL is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic peritoneal tap and diagnostic peritoneal lavage'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-peritoneal-lavage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic peritoneal lavage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DPL is a highly sensitive test for detecting injury following abdominal GSW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/5,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,13</a>]. Using 5000 to 10,000 red blood cells per high-powered field <span class=\"nowrap\">(RBC/HPF)</span> as the threshold for a positive test, the sensitivity of DPL is reported to be 96 percent for GSWs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and 87.5 percent in shotgun wounds (SGW) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. We use 5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">RBC/HPF</span> as the threshold for injury. A retrospective review suggests that this positive criterion can be raised to 100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">RBCs/HPF</span> without missing any significant injuries, if coupled with other positive criteria such as the presence of &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">WBCs/HPF,</span> bile, or amylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Drawbacks to its routine use in patients sustaining an abdominal GSW include its invasive nature, time needed to analyze the DPL effluent, and its lack of specificity for organ injuries that might be managed nonoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Among patients with an abdominal GSW, DPL can play a useful role in several circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A grossly positive DPL aspirate can often determine that the intraperitoneal cavity is the sole or a contributing source of hemorrhagic shock.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with injuries to the low chest, flank, and back, DPL can be used to determine whether the peritoneum has been violated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who cannot be evaluated clinically, DPL can be used to detect hollow viscus injury.</p><p/><p>As an example of the last scenario, DPL might be used in a patient with a severe head injury whose initial abdominal CT shows no injury but who subsequently develops a fever without a clear source. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role for diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) in the management of abdominal GSWs is evolving. DL allows the surgeon to identify peritoneal violation and partially inspect the diaphragm. However, it does not enable adequate visualization of the posterior portion of the diaphragm, nor does it provide an effective means for detecting subtle hollow viscus or retroperitoneal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/5,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15-17</a>].</p><p>Other potential drawbacks to DL include the need for anesthesia and the inability to repair some injuries, requiring conversion to an open laparotomy. DL is best utilized in those patients without a clear indication for laparotomy or thoracotomy with a tangential abdominal GSW or low-left chest injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for laparotomy and general approach to management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of the management of abdominal gunshot wounds (GSWs) is detection of peritoneal violation and intra-abdominal injury. A management algorithm is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110129\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110129 \">algorithm 1</a>); general management of the adult trauma patient is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Indications for immediate laparotomy in the patient with an abdominal GSW include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/1,3,4,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4,18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of peritonitis (eg, rigid abdominal wall, rebound tenderness)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension or hemodynamic instability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evisceration of abdominal contents (bowel or omentum) </p><p/><p>Another potential indication is gastrointestinal bleeding indicative of bowel injury, although this indication in isolation is rare after penetrating trauma, and such bleeding may be present for other reasons.</p><p>The management of patients whose abdomen cannot be examined reliably (eg, unresponsive, intoxicated, or intubated patient) varies depending on local expertise and resources, and the preference of the attending trauma surgeon. Immediate laparotomy and diagnostic laparoscopy are both reasonable options.</p><p>Of note, it is important not to overlook other, possibly extra-abdominal, causes of shock or hemodynamic instability, particularly those amenable to immediate intervention (eg, pericardial tamponade, tension pneumothorax). It may not be the most obvious injury that poses the greatest threat to life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In the past, any patient with suspected peritoneal violation was taken to laparotomy, but for properly selected patients, nonoperative approaches are gaining favor at some trauma centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/5,10,16,19-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10,16,19-27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Selective nonoperative management'</a> below.)</p><p>If the patient with an abdominal GSW is hemodynamically stable with no indications for immediate laparotomy, but their ultrasound (FAST) examination reveals intraperitoneal blood, a computed tomography (CT) scan should be performed. The CT may reveal significant intra-abdominal injury (eg, bowel perforation), in which case the patient is taken to the operating suite, or it may reveal an isolated solid organ injury (eg, isolated liver injury). In the latter case, depending upon hospital resources and protocols, the patient may be observed as an in-patient or taken for laparotomy. For patients who appear stable initially but whose CT scan is equivocal and who are at greater risk should they deteriorate subsequently (eg, older age, major comorbidities), it is reasonable for the trauma surgeon to take them for early laparotomy. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Selective nonoperative management'</a> below.)</p><p>Otherwise, in most trauma centers and other hospitals, a CT is obtained to assess the stable patient with an abdominal GSW. While uncommon, in some cases a careful examination by a clinician experienced with the assessment of GSWs shows that the trajectory of the missile has not violated the peritoneal cavity, in which case a CT is not obtained. As this determination can be difficult, and as many of these patients ultimately require laparotomy, clinicians managing such patients in a rural emergency department (ED) or other resource-limited setting should transfer them expeditiously to a hospital with the resources necessary to provide definitive care, unless CT is performed and reveals no peritoneal violation. Basic diagnostic studies may be obtained, but transfer should not be delayed to obtain them.</p><p>In rare instances, a CT scan performed in a hemodynamically stable patient shows that no peritoneal penetration has occurred following a GSW. Such patients may be discharged from the ED after six hours of observation, assuming that a thorough workup reveals no other signs of injury.</p><p>Neither a urinary (Foley) catheter nor a nasogastric tube are required for management, unless otherwise indicated. In stable patients, the authors prefer to avoid these interventions, unless there is a specific reason for them (eg, trajectory of the projectile raises concern for genitourinary injury). A plain chest radiograph should be obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1146088186\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At a minimum, a type and screen should be obtained for all patients with an abdominal GSW in preparation for possible blood transfusion. A type and crossmatch is obtained if there is evidence of significant hemorrhage or the patient manifests indications for immediate laparotomy. Other laboratory tests that are commonly obtained include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulation studies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thromboelastography if there is any evidence of hemorrhage (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coagulopathy associated with trauma&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial blood gas for patients who are hypotensive or demonstrate hemodynamic instability</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Selective nonoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selective nonoperative management of patients with abdominal GSWs only works in facilities able to provide frequent patient reassessment and to move the patient rapidly to the operating room if hemodynamic instability or peritoneal signs develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/1,19,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19,28</a>]. Even so, the evidence for nonoperative management of GSWs is limited, and some trauma surgeons believe the safest course is laparotomy. In hemodynamically stable patients, CT has gained favor as a noninvasive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic tool that helps to identify patients who might benefit from selective nonoperative management after an abdominal GSW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>]. Typically, these are patients with an isolated solid organ injury, usually involving the liver, and no signs of bowel injury on CT. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography (CT)'</a> above.)</p><p>Any stable patient with a high-velocity abdominal GSW should be observed for a minimum of 24 hours before discharge unless there is clear evidence that no peritoneal penetration occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In an observational study of 245 patients with GSWs to the torso, including 91 managed nonoperatively, all 8 patients initially managed with observation but who ultimately required laparotomy manifested signs of intra-abdominal injury within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Usually, patients managed nonoperatively are admitted and undergo serial abdominal examinations, even if all initial studies are negative. We suggest repeating the examination every four hours, or if there is any change in the patient&rsquo;s condition. Re-examination should include careful assessment of vital signs and the abdomen and chest, and ideally is performed by the same clinician.</p><p>If the patient is hemodynamically stable, and no other significant injury, comorbidity, or other concerning factor (advanced age) is present, it is not necessary to admit the patient to an intensive care unit or to perform cardiac monitoring. Insertion of a urinary (Foley) catheter or nasogastric tube is unnecessary unless there is some other indication.</p><p>For the rare patient with an abdominal GSW but without evidence of peritoneal penetration based on a thorough evaluation (typically including abdominal CT), and without other concerning injuries, a six-hour observation period is reasonable prior to discharge from the ED. However, such cases are uncommon and the great majority of patients who are candidates for selective nonoperative management are observed for a minimum of 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Some centers may try to avoid hospital admission, as suggested by a retrospective study performed at a major, urban trauma center of 107 patients with penetrating abdominal trauma who received a selective ED evaluation involving local wound exploration, CT, and serial examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Of those patients discharged from the ED, 66 percent were available for follow-up and none experienced significant morbidity or mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23309396\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Broad spectrum antibiotics are generally given to patients with penetrating abdominal injury requiring surgical management; routine antibiotic administration is not warranted in most injured patients, including those with penetrating abdominal injury, who are managed nonoperatively. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in the setting of trauma is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H172458237\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of inpatient management in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Flank and back</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a gunshot wound (GSW) to the flank and back are difficult to evaluate due to the potential of injury to retroperitoneal structures. Neither diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL), ultrasound, nor diagnostic laparoscopy is able to provide definitive information regarding injury to these structures. Most centers employ abdomen and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans with IV, oral, and rectal contrast to delineate the missile path and identify potential injuries, especially those of the colon and rectum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/6,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Thoracoabdominal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wounds of the upper abdomen and lower chest are especially difficult to evaluate due to the potential for missiles to ricochet off ribs and the movement of the diaphragm during respiration. If there is concern for a possible thoracoabdominal injury, we suggest obtaining a CT in the hemodynamically stable patient. If the CT is equivocal, we perform laparoscopy.</p><p>DPL is no longer commonly used for evaluation. When DPL is performed in this setting, some recommend lowering the threshold for a positive study to 5000 from 10,000 red blood cells per high powered field <span class=\"nowrap\">(RBCs/HPF)</span> in order not to miss injuries. However, this approach has the potential to increase negative and nontherapeutic laparotomy rates. Other trauma surgeons use diagnostic laparoscopy to inspect the diaphragm and abdominal cavity in the hope of avoiding exploratory laparotomy, and potentially nontherapeutic and negative laparotomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Hypotension immediately following intubation is common, and delayed intubation can allow for more rapid control of the source of hemorrhage while minimizing any potential drop in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, such decisions are difficult and must be made clinically on a case by case basis. In some circumstances, it is prudent to obtain control of the airway rapidly, even with apparently stable patients who are to be taken to the operating room.

Necessary steps should be taken to ensure that the emergency department and hospital are safe and secure, which may include communicating with hospital security or police personnel. Clothing removed from the patient should be placed in brown paper bags or other containers suitable for evidence collection. All wounds should be carefully documented in the medical chart.</p><p>Victims of assault may suffer emotionally as well as physically.

The velocity of the missile and its distance from the patient are important factors in determining the extent of injury. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important historical information includes: prehospital vital signs; number of shots heard; type of gun used; position of the patient when shot; blood loss at the scene; and, the distance of the patient from the gun. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients must be completely undressed. Wounds in the axilla, groin, perineum, scalp, or skin folds can be obscured by clothing. All patients must be log-rolled to evaluate for wounds to the back. GSWs often destroy tissue making local wound exploration less effective for visualizing the entire extent of the missile tract. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Local wound exploration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GSWs to the back, flank, or upper abdomen are more difficult to evaluate. Back or flank wounds may involve injuries to retroperitoneal as well as intraperitoneal structures; upper abdominal or low chest wounds may involve injuries to both intra-abdominal and intrathoracic structures. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Special Considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of hemodynamic instability, signs of peritonitis, or evisceration of bowel or omentum mandates immediate exploratory laparotomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110129\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110129 \">algorithm 1</a>). The management of patients whose abdomen cannot be examined reliably (eg, unresponsive, intoxicated, or intubated patient) varies depending on local expertise and resources: immediate laparotomy and diagnostic laparoscopy are both reasonable options. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Indications for laparotomy and general approach to management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain film radiographs are often employed to define the path of the bullet. Two planes must be imaged to determine if the peritoneum was penetrated. Radiographs are less helpful in patients with through-and-through wounds, wounds in close proximity to ribs or pelvic bones, and multiple bullets or pellets. Ultrasound can rapidly determine the presence or absence of blood in the pericardial and peritoneal spaces but is poor at detecting diaphragmatic or hollow viscus injuries. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Plain radiographs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-resolution, multidetector computed tomography (CT) imaging provides rapid, accurate imaging for patients with abdominal GSWs not in need of immediate laparotomy. CT scan with IV contrast is typically performed in patients with abdominal GSWs to visualize solid organ injuries. If bowel or colorectal trauma is suspected, CT with triple contrast (IV, oral, and rectal) may be performed. However, patients proceed directly to exploratory laparotomy in cases of obvious peritoneal violation. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography (CT)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At a minimum, a type and screen should be obtained for all patients with an abdominal GSW in preparation for possible blood transfusion. A type and crossmatch is obtained if there is evidence of significant hemorrhage or the patient manifests indications for immediate laparotomy. (See <a href=\"#H1146088186\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Broad spectrum antibiotics are generally given to patients with penetrating abdominal injury requiring surgical management; routine antibiotic administration is not warranted in most patients with penetrating abdominal injury, who are managed nonoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H172458237\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of inpatient management in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facilities able to provide frequent, careful patient reassessment and to move patients rapidly to the operating room if peritoneal signs develop may use selective nonoperative management strategies for appropriately selected, hemodynamically stable patients.
