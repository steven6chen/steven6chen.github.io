It happens when normal cells in the bone change into abnormal cells and grow out of control. But in some cases, a Ewing sarcoma starts in tissues outside of the bone.</p><p>This cancer happens most often in children and teens ages 10 to 20, but it can also happen in adults. A Ewing sarcoma most often affects bones in the legs, arms, or pelvis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325681\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a Ewing sarcoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Ewing sarcoma usually causes pain and swelling in the area of the cancer. The pain can come and go, but it usually gets worse over weeks to months. The pain is usually worse at night and with exercise. Some people might also see or feel a lump on their bone.</p><p>People can have other symptoms, too, depending on where the Ewing sarcoma is. For example, if the Ewing sarcoma is close to a joint, it can cause trouble with moving that joint.</p><p>Some people also have a fever, weight loss, or feel more tired than usual.</p><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not a Ewing sarcoma. But if you have these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325696\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a Ewing sarcoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will first order an X-ray of your bone.</p><p>If the X-ray suggests a Ewing sarcoma, you will have other tests. These might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test, such as an MRI or CT scan, of the area &ndash; An imaging test creates pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A full-body bone scan, PET scan, or other imaging test, to check for cancer in other parts of your body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bone marrow biopsy &ndash; The bone marrow is the tissue in the center of certain bones. During this procedure, a doctor takes a very small sample of the bone marrow. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A biopsy of the Ewing sarcoma &ndash; This is a procedure in which a doctor removes a sample from the area suspected to have cancer. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325711\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out if a cancer has spread past the layer of tissue where it began, and, if so, how far.</p><p>The right treatment for you will depend a lot on the stage of your Ewing sarcoma and your other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325726\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a Ewing sarcoma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Ewing sarcoma is usually treated with both surgery and chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; The type of surgery you have depends on where your cancer is and how big it is. For cancer in an arm or leg, doctors usually do &quot;limb-sparing&quot; surgery. This is when the doctor removes the cancer without removing the arm or leg. Depending on the type of surgery, the doctor might need to &quot;rebuild&quot; part of the bone after surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. People with a Ewing sarcoma usually have chemotherapy both before and after their surgery.</p><p/><p>Some people with a Ewing sarcoma are also treated with radiation therapy. This involves getting high doses of X-rays (radiation) aimed at your cancer. Radiation kills cancer cells. People might have radiation therapy after surgery, especially if their doctor can't remove all of their cancer during surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325741\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor will check you every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Follow-up tests can include exams, blood tests, chest X-rays, and imaging tests.</p><p>You should also watch for the symptoms listed above. Having those symptoms could mean your cancer has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325756\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my Ewing sarcoma comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your Ewing sarcoma comes back or spreads, you might have more surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325771\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for a Ewing sarcoma involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325786\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
