Though there has been an overall decline in CVD mortality over the past 40 years, the mortality in younger women has plateaued since around the year 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) in women, although lower than in men, increases dramatically following menopause. The increase is at least in part due to increasing age since men also have a progressive increase in MI with age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57061\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57061 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In a report from the Nurses' Health Study of 85,941 women who were followed for 14 years, incident CHD was 31 percent lower in the two years from 1992 to 1994 than it was in the two years from 1980 to 1982 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. During this time period, the number of subjects who smoked decreased by 41 percent, although the number who were overweight increased by 38 percent. It was concluded that the reduction in smoking accounted for a 13 percent decline in CHD, and an improvement in diet explained a 16 percent decline, while the increase in weight accounted for an 8 percent increase in CHD.</p><p>An overview of the determinants of cardiovascular risk in women will be reviewed here.

Among a cohort of 1.2 million women (mean age 56 years) without known CVD at baseline, the most common self-reported age of menarche was 13 years of age (25 percent), with 4 percent reporting early menarche at 10 years of age or younger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Compared with women who experienced menarche at 13 years of age, there was a significantly increased risk of developing CHD in women with premature menarche (relative risk [RR] 1.27; 95% CI 1.22-1.31). Similar findings were reported in a 2014 meta-analysis of six smaller cohorts encompassing fewer than 150,000 women, in which each one-year increase in age at menarche was associated with a 3 percent reduction in total mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30666522\"><span class=\"h3\">Menopause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CVD is unusual in premenopausal women, particularly in the absence of other risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57061\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57061 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. By comparison, the American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> Guidelines recognize the postmenopausal state as a risk factor for CVD, assigning it the same weight as male sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>].</p><p>Early natural menopause (&le;44 years of age) has been associated with an increase in the risk of CVD in two large epidemiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In one, this effect was limited to current smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], while the second study only included women who never smoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Data are conflicting on whether the type of menopause (surgical or natural) affects cardiovascular risk. In a report from the Nurses' Health Study, bilateral oophorectomy, but not natural menopause, was associated with an excess risk of CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, a subsequent study of healthy, postmenopausal women (age 46 to 81) who were not on hormone therapy found that increased carotid artery intima-media thickness, a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, was positively associated with years since menopause but not with the type of menopause (natural versus oophorectomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-intima-media-thickness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carotid intima-media thickness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These observations do not prove that menopause itself is causal for developing CVD. Although the CVD incidence rises dramatically over time following menopause, there is also a marked increase in men with increasing age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57061\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57061 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An important contributing factor is that postmenopausal women who develop CVD have an increased burden of risk factors compared with those who do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Consistent with this hypothesis that menopause may not be directly responsible for the increase in CVD risk after menopause is the lack of benefit from hormone replacement therapy in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), mostly of primary prevention, and in the HERS trials of secondary prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Estrogen-progestin replacement had no cardioprotective effect and may have produced harm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76930%7EENDO%2F62591\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76930 graphicRef62591 \">figure 2A-B</a>). As a result, hormone replacement therapy is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30666845\"><span class=\"h3\">Hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possible role of hysterectomy as a predictor of cardiovascular risk was assessed in a report from the WHI Observational Study of almost 90,000 postmenopausal women, approximately 40 percent of whom had undergone hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. After multivariable adjustment, hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy was not associated with a significant increase in total mortality or fatal and nonfatal CVD. This observation is consistent with the findings in the previous section suggesting that menopause itself may not be an independent risk factor for CHD.

However, because MI and stroke are extremely rare events in otherwise healthy women of reproductive age, even a doubling of the risk would result in an extremely low attributable risk. The cardiovascular effects of oral contraceptives are described in detail elsewhere.
