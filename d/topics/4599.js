It can keep the brain and other organs from being damaged by lack of oxygen. You do CPR until the heart can be shocked back into action or until it becomes clear the person cannot be saved.</p><p>The instructions for doing CPR on adults are different from the instructions for doing CPR on children and infants. This article is about doing CPR on children and infants. In this context:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;<strong>Child</strong>&quot; means any child who is 1 year old or older and who has not yet started puberty. (Puberty is the time in life when a child's body changes into the body of an adult. In girls, these changes typically start at about age 10 or 11. In boys, they typically start at about age 12 or 13.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;<strong>Infant</strong>&quot; means any baby younger than 1 year.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1716932018\"><span class=\"h1\">What is an AED?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AED stands for &quot;automated external defibrillator.&quot; It is a device that can tell if a person's heart needs to be shocked, and then give the shock. This can sometimes get a normal heart rhythm started again.</p><p>Many public places, such as shopping malls, airports, and sports events, have AEDs available. They come with directions so anyone can use them, even without special training. AEDs can save lives, since shocking a person's heart has the best chance of working when it is done right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9508822\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if a child or infant needs CPR?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you see a child or infant who is passed out, tap him or her firmly and ask, &quot;Are you OK?&quot; If the child or infant does not respond to your voice or touch, is not breathing, or is breathing abnormally (gasping), <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p>If another person is nearby, tell them to get the AED while you start CPR. When you call for an ambulance, the person who answers the phone can tell you what to do. They will help you do CPR and tell you when you should use the AED. If you are calling with a cell phone, put the speaker on so you can have your hands free.</p><p>The person who needs CPR is often called the &quot;victim.&quot; The person who does CPR is often called the &quot;rescuer.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9508837\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I do CPR?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can do CPR even if you have never done it before and have never been trained. All you have to do is press <strong>hard and fast</strong> on the center of the victim's chest. You can still help if you're not sure how to do CPR.</p><p>Pressing on the chest for CPR is called doing &quot;compressions.&quot; Compressions squeeze the victim's heart and get blood moving again.</p><p><strong>If the victim is</strong> <strong>a child</strong>, you can do compressions using either the 2-hand or the 1-hand method. No matter how you do compressions, between compressions lift all pressure off the victim's chest, so that his or her chest goes back to where it was.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>2-hand method</strong>: First make sure the victim is on a flat, solid surface. Then kneel over the victim, stack your hands on top of one another with both palms facing down, and lock your fingers together. Holding your arms straight, press on the center of the victim's chest with the heel of your bottom hand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53623\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53623 \">picture 1</a>). Use your body weight, rather than the strength of your arms, to press on the chest. Make sure the victim's chest drops down at least 2 inches under your weight with each push.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>1-hand method</strong>: First make sure the victim is on a flat, solid surface. Then kneel over the victim, and place the heel of 1 hand on the center of the victim's chest. Holding your arm straight, press on the center of the victim's chest with the heel of your bottom hand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55732\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55732 \">picture 2</a>). Use your body weight, rather than the strength of your arm, to press on the chest. Make sure the victim's chest drops down at least 2 inches under your weight with each push.</p><p/><p><strong>If the victim is</strong> <strong>an infant</strong>, you can do compressions using either the 2-finger or the 2-thumb method.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>2-finger method</strong>: Lay the victim on a solid flat surface. Then put the fingertips of the index and middle fingers of 1 hand on the center of the infant's chest and start compressions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61268\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61268 \">picture 3</a>). Make sure his or her chest drops down at least 1&frac12; inches under your pressure with each push.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>2-thumb method</strong>: Hold the victim with both hands, placing both thumbs on the center of the chest. Press both thumbs on the center of the infant's chest and start compressions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52104\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52104 \">figure 1</a>). Make sure his or her chest drops down at least 1&frac12; inches under your pressure with each push.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9508852\"><span class=\"h1\">What do I do besides compressions?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follow 3 main steps, which are easy to remember based on the letters C-A-B:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;C&quot; stands for &quot;Do chest <strong>compressions</strong>&quot; &ndash; For this part, you do 30 compressions using 1 of the methods described above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;A&quot; stands for &quot;Check the <strong>airway</strong>&quot; &ndash; For this part, you check the position of the victim's head and jaw to make sure the victim can breathe. If the victim's airway is closed, you can try moving the victim's head or opening his or her jaw to get the airway open.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;B&quot; stands for &quot;Do rescue <strong>breathing</strong>&quot; &ndash; For this part, you blow 2 breaths into to victim's mouth or mouth and nose. If the victim is a small child or an infant, you might need to form a seal over the victim's mouth and nose. If the victim is a larger child, you can instead pinch the victim's nose shut and breathe into his or her mouth. Rescue breathing gets some new air &ndash; with more oxygen &ndash; into the victim's lungs. After giving 2 breaths, you keep repeating the cycle &ndash; of 30 compressions and 2 rescue breaths &ndash; until an ambulance comes or someone else takes over.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9508867\"><span class=\"h1\">Have the guidelines on how to do CPR changed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. When doing CPR, rescuers are now told to do compressions first, then check the airway and do rescue breathing. (The order of these steps used to be different.) The American Heart Association (AHA) last updated the guidelines about how to do CPR in 2015.</p><p>To learn more about CPR and find training centers in the United States or internationally, go to <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/&amp;token=rvTukyyIVowC5RKz8kYMi3mypSX1wYyjoqb7S5aroXY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=16564\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.heart.org</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9508882\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-injury-in-children-and-adolescents-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Head injury in children and adolescents (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sudden cardiac arrest (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
