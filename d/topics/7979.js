A Japanese prospective study examining patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> found that the median progression-free survival was 4.6 months in patients with HFSR versus 1.5 months in patients without [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Inhibition of either one of these receptors alone rarely leads to HFSR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Moreover, the observation that the incidence of HFSR increases when multikinase inhibitors are combined with VEGF receptor blockers such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> and cediranib supports the theory that capillary microtrauma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inability to effectively repair vascular trauma at sites prone to mechanical and frictional stress results in drug extravasation and tissue damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Further supporting the importance of vascular competence in the pathogenesis of HFSR is its increased incidence in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regorafenib</a>, which uniquely inhibits the endothelium-specific TIE-2 receptor (important for vascular remodeling) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3665646673\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main histopathologic features described for HFSR are similar to hand-foot syndrome (HFS) caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy. They include dyskeratotic keratinocytes at various stages of necrosis, vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, and mild perivascular or lichenoid infiltrate that is predominantly lymphocytic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Necrotic subepidermal, intraepidermal, or subcorneal blisters can form followed by acanthosis with hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis. Cases of mild cystic degeneration of the eccrine coil and squamous metaplasia of the sweat glands have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. While the histologic features of HFS and HFSR can be similar, HFSR is more likely to show an increased rate of epidermal replication resulting in papillomatosis and acanthosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1188950118\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HFSR appears in the first two to four weeks of treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It typically involves the palms and soles but can also occur in other friction-prone areas such as the interdigital web spaces and lateral aspects of the feet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

One study examining the data from 23 patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a> who completed the Skindex-16 (a self-reported, dermatology-specific quality of life [QoL] questionnaire) found a positive correlation between scores for symptoms and emotions and severity grade of HFSR, with the highest score reported for the symptoms domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Two instruments have been developed to assess specifically the HRQL in patients with hand-foot syndrome (HFS) and HFSR, the HFS-14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], which assesses functional implications, and the newer HFSR and quality of life (HF-QoL) questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The latter evaluates the wider symptom burden, including physical well-being, activities of daily living, role function, social activities, emotional well-being, and mood. Although generally used in the setting of clinical trials, these instruments may be helpful in clinical practice to assess the patient's tolerance of treatment and overall clinical status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H583188773\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of HFSR is usually straightforward, based upon the clinical appearance of hyperkeratotic plaques with painful erythema localized to areas of friction or pressure of the palms and soles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109135\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109135 \">picture 1C</a>) and history of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) use.

In clinical trials and oncology practices, the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, is the most commonly employed scale to assess the severity of cutaneous adverse reactions to cancer treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109158\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109158 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Although HFSR is not included in CTCAE as its own category, &quot;palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia&quot; can be used to grade HFSR. It is also important to keep in mind the limitations of the CTCAE scale, which does not incorporate the patient's perception of severity or the potentially prolonged duration of HFSR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hand-foot-skin-reaction-induced-by-multitargeted-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1322784026\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of HFSR includes other eruptions occurring primarily on the hands and feet.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hand-foot syndrome (HFS)</strong> &ndash; In patients receiving both a targeted agent and a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent, this distinction may be important to guide the reduction of the appropriate medication, if indicated.
