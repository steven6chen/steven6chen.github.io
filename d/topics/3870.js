However, despite some similarities, the clinicopathologic manifestations of IBM are clearly distinct from the other disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74076\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74076 \">table 1</a>).

There is a paucity of data on the annual incidence; the reported range in two studies is from 1 to 7.9 per million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Due to the high incidence of weakness complaints in older adults and the insidious onset of weakness in IBM, this disease is frequently misdiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Indeed, it is the most common acquired idiopathic inflammatory myopathy in individuals over the age of 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The disease affects men more often than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The mean age at onset of symptoms is approximately 60 years, with a range from the fourth to the ninth decade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H771064399\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with inclusion body myositis (IBM) present with the <strong>insidious onset</strong> of weakness. The average duration of symptoms before diagnosis is about five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. The most common initial presentation is slowly progressive proximal leg weakness, with difficulty getting up out of a chair or frequent falls. In some patients, the initial complaint may be with weakness of grip strength, such as difficulty opening jars. Rarely, patients may present with isolated dysphagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The characteristic physical exam finding is weakness of the distal finger flexor muscles in approximately 95 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], often accompanied by scalloping of the medial forearm flexor compartment. Though often difficult to detect on physical examination early in the course of disease, weakness and atrophy of quadriceps (knee extensor) muscles are seen in the majority of patients.</p><p>The following features can be seen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis, patients with IBM are more likely to have asymmetric and distal muscle involvement and a more slowly progressive course.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both proximal leg and distal arm muscle groups are usually involved. Involvement of the hip flexors, quadriceps, tibialis anterior with weakness of the ankle dorsiflexors, and forearm flexors with grip weakness are characteristic of IBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Facial muscles (especially muscle controlling eye closure) may be involved, but the oculomotor muscles are spared.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myalgias may accompany the weakness but are usually mild [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle atrophy progresses in parallel with the duration and severity of weakness and is greater than would be expected for the same degree of weakness in polymyositis. Deep tendon reflexes also decrease in parallel with the decline in strength.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphagia due to involvement of the cricopharyngeal muscle occurs in about one-third to one-half of patients. It may rarely be the presenting complaint, in some cases preceding the onset of extremity weakness by up to seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/7,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle enzymes are typically mildly elevated early in the disease, but may normalize with disease progression. Creatine kinase (CK) levels are usually less than 10 times normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. An elevation of CK greater than 15 times the upper limit of normal suggests an alternative diagnosis. Glucocorticoids may dramatically reduce serum CK levels in IBM, and a normalization of serum CK in the absence of an improvement of weakness is common in IBM. Measures of the acute phase response, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or the C-reactive protein (CRP), are usually normal. Myositis-specific autoantibodies are typically absent in patients with IBM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults#H17269508\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;, section on 'Myositis-specific autoantibodies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) generally depends upon the presence of characteristic clinical and laboratory findings which include slowly progressive muscle weakness, with early involvement of the quadriceps muscles and <span class=\"nowrap\">wrist/finger</span> flexors, and elevated muscle enzymes. While a muscle biopsy should be considered in all patients with suspected IBM, histopathological confirmation is not always possible, and the diagnosis may still be made based on characteristic clinical findings.</p><p>The diagnosis of IBM should be considered in patients over the age of 45 who present with progressive muscle weakness, even in the absence of an elevated serum creatine kinase (CK). If patients have proximal leg weakness and distal arm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leg weakness on exam, referral to a neurologist and muscle biopsy should be performed at a center with the ability to appropriately process and interpret the biopsy.</p><p>Diagnostic criteria, which have been developed for use in research, have sometimes been used to aid in making the diagnosis but have limitations when used for this purpose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F104102\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104102 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H771064528\" class=\"local\">'Proposed diagnostic criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>Our approach to the diagnosis of IBM is presented below. A more general approach to the evaluation of a patient with muscle weakness is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-muscle-weakness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with muscle weakness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical history serves to identify clinical manifestations of IBM as well as identify other possible causes of muscle weakness.</p><p>We perform a thorough history with particular attention to the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insidious onset of falls due to weakness of knee extensors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> foot drop, typically in the absence of sensory complaints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty standing from the floor or a low chair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of dexterity of hands or grip strength due to finger flexor weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphagia</p><p/><p>We also ask about exposure to a variety of prescription and illicit drugs that may cause myopathy, myositis, neuropathy, or other disorders that cause muscle weakness. Among the drug exposures that should be specifically sought are antimalarial drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, glucocorticoids, cholesterol-lowering drugs (eg, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors [statins]), alcohol, and cocaine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-myopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced myopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of associated conditions should be reviewed since as many as 15 percent of IBM patients have underlying autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), Hashimoto thyroiditis, variable immunoglobulin deficiency, sarcoidosis, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, unlike other inflammatory myopathies such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis, IBM is not associated with myocarditis, interstitial lung disease, or an increased risk of malignancy.</p><p>A careful family history should be taken, as some hereditary myopathies such as Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy and hereditary IBM may have proximal and distal weakness as well as rimmed vacuoles <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammation on muscle biopsy and may be misdiagnosed as IBM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination helps to determine the distribution of muscle weakness and atrophy. Findings of quadriceps (ie, knee extensor) and forearm flexor (ie, wrist and finger flexor) muscle weakness and wasting are clinical hallmarks of IBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Many patients also have significant hip flexion weakness and are typically unable to stand from a chair without pushing off with their arms. With severe quadriceps weakness, patients may walk with the leg hyperextended (genu recurvatum). To detect subtle weakness of distal finger flexion (typically the earliest exam finding), the clinician should isolate and specifically examine flexion at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. Other muscles that are commonly affected are orbicularis oculi (leading to weakness with eye closure), triceps (weakness with arm extension), and tibialis anterior (leading to foot drop) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>While many patients with IBM present with symmetric and proximal muscle weakness suggestive of polymyositis, the finding of more distal, asymmetric involvement with finger and wrist flexor weakness greater than deltoid weakness and knee extensor weakness greater than hip flexor weakness would be more typical of IBM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no definitive diagnostic laboratory test for IBM. Mild to moderate elevations of plasma muscle enzyme levels (serum CK less than 10-fold higher than normal) are common with IBM, while levels greater than 15-fold suggest other causes.</p><p>The purpose of laboratory testing is primarily to exclude an alternative diagnosis that could lead to weakness and to look for associated conditions. Laboratory tests that may be useful in the evaluation of weakness include serum electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, creatine kinase, aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, serum aminotransferases, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-muscle-weakness#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with muscle weakness&quot;, section on 'Laboratory studies'</a>). An elevated alkaline phosphatase level should prompt evaluation for Paget disease, which can be seen in hereditary IBM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Paget disease of bone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Testing for autoantibodies directed against cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase 1A (cN1A) may be helpful for distinguishing IBM from other forms of myositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. A study evaluated the diagnostic performance of immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, and IgG anti-cN1A serum antibodies detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 205 patients with muscle disease, 50 of whom had IBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A combination assay of all three autoantibody levels resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 76 and 91 percent, respectively. However, anti-cN1A antibodies are also detected in about 20 percent of patients with SLE and Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome in the absence of muscle disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Laboratory testing is commercially available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and we recommend testing in diagnostically challenging cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-myopathies#H28307286\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathies&quot;, section on 'Role of adaptive immune responses'</a>.)</p><p>There is an association of IBM with some autoimmune diseases, such as Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome and sarcoidosis, as well as with some lymphoproliferative disorders such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, IBM has been observed in patients with chronic viral infections such as HIV and Hepatitis C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. As such, screening laboratory testing for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-Ro(SSA), anti-La(SSB), serum immunofixation, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C may be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2477710012\"><span class=\"h2\">Electromyography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies are extremely useful tests in all patients with suspected muscle disease. EMG in IBM typically reveals an &quot;irritable myopathy&quot; with increased insertional activity, fibrillations, positive waves, and early recruitment of short-duration, small-amplitude polyphasic motor unit action potentials (MUAPs). Fasciculations are not observed. These findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy; a muscle biopsy is then indicated for pathologic diagnosis. In some muscles, EMG may show reduced recruitment and a mixture of short and long duration, small- and large-amplitude polyphasic MUAPs. This mixed pattern of myopathic and &quot;neurogenic&quot;-appearing units is more typical of IBM than polymyositis or dermatomyositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/11,15,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15,29,30</a>]. Nerve conduction studies are usually normal, but may show a concomitant peripheral neuropathy in some cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electromyography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electromyography&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nerve conduction studies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally reserved for diagnostically challenging cases. While there are no findings on MRI studies that are diagnostic for IBM, there are some disease-specific patterns of muscle involvement that may support the diagnosis and help distinguish IBM from polymyositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. For example, MRI of the thigh typically shows edema, atrophy, and fatty replacement of the anterior compartment with relative sparing of the medial and posterior compartments. MRI may be useful in guiding the selection of a muscle for biopsy, as the diagnostic yield for biopsy is low in muscles with extensive atrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fatty replacement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle biopsy may be diagnostic in IBM and in many cases can distinguish it from polymyositis and other muscle diseases, which is not always possible on a clinical basis. We biopsy muscles that are only moderately weak (4 or 4+ on MRC scale) and prefer biceps or quadriceps muscles. However, in some cases the muscle biopsy in IBM is nonspecific and the diagnosis depends on a combination of clinical findings and a biopsy consistent with IBM.</p><p>The histologic features on muscle biopsy associated with IBM include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mononuclear cell infiltration of non-necrotic muscle fibers. The infiltrate is predominantly CD8+ T lymphocytes and macrophages. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I is upregulated on immunostaining. These are histologic features of an inflammatory myopathy and are also seen in polymyositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sarcoplasmic &quot;rimmed&quot; vacuoles that are red-rimmed on modified trichrome stain and blue-rimmed on H&amp;E.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myofiber degeneration, regeneration, and necrosis may be seen.

These inclusions can be seen in the sarcoplasm and within myonuclei.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amyloid deposits in vacuolated fibers identified by Congo red staining are occasionally observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunostaining for p62 and TDP-43 labeled characteristic protein aggregates. These inclusions are much more common than amyloid, and the presence of fibers on biopsy that contain these protein aggregates increases diagnostic certainty for IBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].</p><p/><p>The commonly used Griggs criteria require the presence of rimmed vacuoles, mononuclear inflammatory cells invading non-necrotic muscle fibers, and the presence of either amyloid deposits or tubulofilaments by electron microscopy for pathologically definite IBM is highly specific when all three components are present, but lacks sensitivity and is rarely used clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. There may be sampling variability, and not all of the histologic features may be present in early disease but may appear on subsequent biopsies. Furthermore, electron microscopy of muscle tissue is only performed routinely at a few specialized centers.</p><p>Immunohistologic and electron-microscopic evaluation of the tissue require freshly frozen muscle and special fixatives. A discussion of the technical aspects of muscle biopsy is discussed in detail elsewhere.

This may be facilitated by a discussion between the clinician requesting the biopsy, the surgeon, and pathologist prior to the procedure, or by referral of the patient to a center with the necessary laboratory facilities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H771064528\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPOSED DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several diagnostic criteria have been developed based on expert opinion and consensus groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. While these diagnostic criteria are essential for the purposes of research and classifying patients for clinical trials, their clinical use is often limited by a lack of sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A relatively simple and clinically useful set of criteria has been proposed that has 90 percent sensitivity and 96 percent specificity among 371 patients with muscle diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finger flexor or quadriceps weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endomysial inflammation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasion of nonnecrotic muscle fibers or rimmed vacuoles</p><p/><p>The proposed European Neuromuscular Centre (ENMC) 2011 &quot;Clinically Defined&quot; diagnostic criteria diagnose inclusion body myositis (IBM) with &gt;99 percent specificity but a sensitivity of only 57 percent (ie, approximately 43 percent of IBM patients seen in routine clinical practice will not satisfy these definite criteria, typically due to hip flexor weakness &gt; knee extensor weakness) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F104102\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104102 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/8,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,44</a>].

Combining clinical and histologic findings increases the chance of a correct diagnosis. The lack of response to high-dose steroids should lead to a reevaluation of the diagnosis of polymyositis, which is increasingly recognized as a rare entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

In contrast to sporadic IBM, the onset of weakness is usually in early adulthood and spares quadriceps muscles. The family history and a paucity of inflammation on histologic examination help to distinguish these rare heritable disorders from sporadic IBM.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The most common cause of hIBM is &quot;GNE myopathy&quot; (hIBM2), an autosomal recessive form of inclusion body myopathy caused by mutations in the gene for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine <span class=\"nowrap\">2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine</span> kinase (GNE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].

The originally described phenotype of autosomal dominantly inherited IBM with Paget disease of bone (PDB) and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) caused by mutations in the gene for valosin-containing protein (VCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>], has been expanded to include neurodegeneration of motor neurons, peripheral nerves, and other neuronal subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-inclusion-body-myositis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Furthermore, mutations in other genes including <span class=\"nowrap\">SQSTM1/p62,</span> hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2B1, and Matrin-3 can cause a similar MSP syndrome. That similar protein aggregates and rimmed vacuoles are observed in muscle in these patients with a multisystem degenerative disease suggests an intriguing pathophysiologic link between sporadic IBM and neurodegenerative diseases. The genetic, clinical, and histological features of these rare diseases are just being described, but can usually be distinguished from sporadic IBM by the absence of inflammation on muscle biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Muscular dystrophy &ndash; Other inherited myopathies that variably show rimmed vacuoles <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammation of muscle biopsy can occasionally be misdiagnosed as IBM, in particular oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), fascioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), and limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)&mdash;particularly the myofibrillar myopathies, dysferlinopathies, and ANO5.

The distribution of weakness can be either symmetric or asymmetric, and both proximal and distal muscle groups can be involved. Dysphagia occurs in about one-third of patients. (See <a href=\"#H383299\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle enzymes are typically normal or mildly elevated in IBM, with creatine kinase (CK) levels generally being less than 10 times normal. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of sporadic IBM depends upon the presence of characteristic clinical and laboratory findings which include a slowly progressive muscle weakness with early involvement of the quadriceps muscles and <span class=\"nowrap\">wrist/finger</span> flexors, and elevated muscle enzymes. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A muscle biopsy should be performed in all patients with suspected IBM. However, histopathological confirmation is not always possible, and the diagnosis may still be made based on characteristic clinical findings. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle biopsy findings that are highly specific for IBM include the presence of rimmed vacuoles, mononuclear cell inflammatory infiltrate of non-necrotic muscle fibers, and the presence of either amyloid deposits or tubulofilaments by electron microscopy. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Muscle biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings on electromyography (EMG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also help support the diagnosis of IBM when present. EMG typically reveals an &quot;irritable myopathy&quot; with increased insertional activity, fibrillations, positive waves, and early recruitment of short-duration, small-amplitude polyphasic motor unit action potentials (MUAPs). MRI abnormalities in IBM tend to be localized to the anterior muscle groups. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2477710012\" class=\"local\">'Electromyography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of IBM includes other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (eg, dermatomyositis and polymyositis), hereditable inclusion body myopathies (hIBM), drug-induced myopathies, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
