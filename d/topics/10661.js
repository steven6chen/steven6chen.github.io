These adaptations to the pregnant state begin just after conception and evolve through delivery, after which they almost completely revert back to the nonpregnant state over a period of weeks. The purpose of these alterations is to accommodate the needs of the maternal-fetal unit.</p><p>The normal metabolic and endocrinologic changes in pregnancy will be reviewed here. Metabolic and endocrinologic diseases complicating pregnancy are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOCRINE ADAPTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal endocrine adaptations to pregnancy involve the hypothalamus, pituitary, parathyroid, thyroid, adrenal glands, and ovary, and are linked to the interactions of the fetal-placental-maternal unit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothalamic hormones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hypothalamus regulates much of the endocrine system by coordinating input from multiple areas and output via the hypothalamic-pituitary axis through cell to cell communication (paracrine signaling) and within the same cell communication (autocrine signaling). This axis directly affects the function of the thyroid gland, the adrenal gland, and the gonads and influences growth, lactation, and water balance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53814\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53814 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. An intact hypothalamus is necessary for natural conception; however, it is not essential when assisted reproductive techniques are being employed as long as full hormone replacement therapy is administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothalamic-pituitary-axis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothalamic-pituitary axis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The hypothalamic stimulatory hormones are gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), and prolactin-releasing factors. Somatostatin and prolactin-inhibiting factors are inhibitory hypothalamic hormones. These hormones are present at high concentrations in the portal circulation where they are biologically active, but are almost nondetectable in the systemic circulation of nonpregnant women. However, the circulating concentrations of many of these hormones rise during pregnancy due to placental production of identical or variant hormones.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GnRH is a decapeptide hormone that mediates reproductive function via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. GnRH concentration increases during pregnancy, but the physiological significance of this change has not been determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The main source of circulating GnRH is the placenta where it may play a role in placental growth and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Placental GnRH concentration increases until the second trimester and then plateaus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], whereas GnRH mRNA expression remains stable throughout the pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRH is a 41 amino acid peptide involved in the response to stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It is directed at the corticotroph cells of the pituitary, thereby regulating ACTH secretion during stressful events. CRH is expressed by placental and chorionic trophoblasts, amnion, and decidual cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. Its concentration in maternal circulation is high and rises exponentially throughout pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; CRH mRNA expression also increases during gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].<br/><br/>In the placental HPA axis, cortisol stimulates CRH release in the decidua-trophoblast-membranes compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Placental CRH, in turn, appears to further drive maternal and fetal pituitary activation, establishing a potent positive feedback loop. The rise in CRH, either at term or preterm, has been suggested as a link to the initiation of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].<br/><br/>Besides the secretion of CRH, gestational tissues are also able to secrete urocortin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], a member of the CRH family, which has a 45 percent homology with CRH and shares the same functions. Two additional members of the CRH family, urocortin 2 and 3, have been characterized in gestational tissue and have a role in the control of vascular endothelial tone. They have structural homology (34 and 32 percent, respectively) with CRH, but neither is able to stimulate ACTH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Its concentration throughout pregnancy is similar to that in nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, growth hormone (GH) values are higher during pregnancy due to placental secretion of a variant of this hormone (vGH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somatostatin is a neuropeptide and is also produced by the placenta; the amount of hormone secreted decreases with advancing gestation. Placental somatostatin appears to inhibit production of human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS), a hormone that causes insulin resistance. Thus, reduced secretion of somatostatin in the latter half of pregnancy may represent a factor in the insulin resistance observed at that time (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Glucose metabolism'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TRH does not increase in the systemic circulation. Placental synthesis of immunologically active TRH occurs, but at a low level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Exogenously administered TRH crosses the placenta and can stimulate the fetal pituitary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kisspeptin is a neuropeptide product of the tumor suppressor gene, KISS-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. One of its functions is central control of the gonadotropic axis, particularly the pubertal process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. This effect is likely mediated via release of GnRH. Reproductive dysfunction associated with leptin-deficient states may be related to diminished expression of KISS-1. Kisspeptin is also produced by the placenta and appears to play a role in placentation (trophoblast invasion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. It is produced by syncytiotrophoblast and serum levels markedly increase in pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pituitary gland</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland enlarges up to threefold during gestation because of hyperplasia and hypertrophy of lactotrophs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73519\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73519 \">figure 1</a>). These changes do not completely resolve in the postpartum period; however, magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary demonstrates a return to normal volume within six months after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior pituitary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy is associated with a variety of changes in hormone release from the anterior pituitary:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a decline in circulating gonadotropin concentrations across gestation with a progressively diminishing response to GnRH. The suppression of gonadotropins is probably due to the high estradiol and progesterone concentrations during pregnancy. This is also probably due to the effect of the high maternal serum levels of inhibin A and inhibin B produced by placenta and fetal membranes throughout the pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of gonadotropin-releasing hormone&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Inhibins and activins'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth hormone production is reduced. Pituitary GH exhibits a decline by 24 weeks of gestation and is replaced by rising placental-derived GH, which peaks at 35 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/21,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-growth-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of growth hormone&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an increase in serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], probably in response to CRH produced by trophoblasts which, as noted above, are stimulated by cortisol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The increase in ACTH is associated with increases in serum, salivary, and urinary free cortisol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Thus, pregnancy is a state of relative hypercortisolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyrotropin (TSH) secretion is modestly reduced in the first trimester in response to the thyrotropic effects of rising human chorionic gonadotropin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In contrast, serum TSH concentrations may be modestly elevated at term due to increases in renal iodine clearance and placental degradation of thyroid hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. During pregnancy TSH retains its normal circadian rhythm (nocturnal surge), indicating an intact pituitary-thyroid axis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serum prolactin concentration (PRL) increases throughout pregnancy, reaching a peak at delivery to prepare the breast for lactation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82454\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82454 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The magnitude of the increase is quite variable; in one study, as an example, the mean value at term was 207 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> with a range of 35 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The probable cause of hyperprolactinemia is the increasing serum estradiol concentration during pregnancy. By six weeks after delivery, estradiol secretion has decreased and the basal serum prolactin concentration is usually normal in the non-breast feeding mother. In women who are nursing, the decline in serum prolactin level is slower and marked by intermittent hyperprolactinemia related to suckling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Pregnancy appears to permanently reduce pituitary prolactin secretion. This was illustrated in a study that compared basal and stimulated prolactin levels in 24 women before and after a first full-term pregnancy to 40 nulliparous controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The serum prolactin concentration was lower in parous women at up to 12 years postpartum.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Intermediate lobe of the pituitary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intermediate lobe of the pituitary increases in volume during pregnancy. This increase is correlated with higher melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) levels, which increase beginning in the first trimester. The placenta is probably not a source of alpha-melanotrophin, but the fetus is a possible source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Hyperpigmentation (linea nigra, chloasma), normally present in most pregnant women, is linked to the increased MSH levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior pituitary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland is a storage terminal for oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH, arginine vasopressin), produced by the supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei. Antidiuretic hormone plays a major role in controlling plasma osmolality, which is primarily determined by the plasma sodium concentration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema#H96014898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;, section on 'Regulation of plasma tonicity'</a>.)</p><p>The plasma sodium concentration falls approximately 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> early in pregnancy due to resetting of the osmoreceptors for ADH release and thirst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This effect appears to be mediated by the increase in human chorionic gonadotropin&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Another change is that the metabolic clearance rate of ADH markedly increases between gestational week 10 and midpregnancy due to vasopressinase released by the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The plasma ADH concentration usually remains normal in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], but some women develop polyuria due to transient diabetes insipidus. At least some of these women may have reduced secretory reserve of ADH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Renal and urinary tract physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Oxytocin is involved in the process of parturition and the &quot;let down&quot; response during lactation. Maternal plasma concentrations rise continuously across gestation, with no further increase around the onset of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Postpartum, nipple stimulation promotes the release of oxytocin. Milk ejection ensues due to stimulation of myoepithelial cells in ductal smooth muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Parathyroid gland</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) maintains calcium homeostasis; calcium levels inversely correlate with PTH levels. PTH function is locally mediated by parathyroid 1 receptor (mainly expressed in kidney and bone) and by parathyroid 2 receptor (mainly expressed in other endocrine tissue, placenta and brain). Intact PTH levels decline in the first half of pregnancy, reach a nadir in the second trimester, and rise thereafter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60320 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50</a>]. </p><p>During pregnancy alone (and at no other time during the lifecycle), vitamin D metabolism is uncoupled from calcium such that by the end of the first trimester, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels are more than double levels in the nonpregnant state without concurrent changes in serum calcium concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. In addition, levels of free 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (the storage or precursor form of active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) are also elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In contrast to the importance of PTH in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D regulation in non-pregnant individuals, the increase in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D during gestation does not follow an increase in PTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/47,48,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48,50</a>]. This suggests that this rise derives from another source, unrelated to the kidney. There is substantial evidence that this source is the placenta, which possesses 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity and is able to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D from its precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. The paradoxical decrease in PTH during gestation is likely due to direct inhibition of PTH production either by already high levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or by increased intestinal absorption of calcium due to high levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid gland</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maternal thyroid gland undergoes a number of physiologic modifications to meet the metabolic demands of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. The major changes are an increase in serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentrations and stimulation of the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor by human chorionic gonadotropin. These changes result in different&nbsp;TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) reference intervals that vary by trimester and differ from the non-pregnant state. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroid disease in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Thyroid adaptation during normal pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p>As a result of the increased metabolic function of the thyroid gland, maternal iodine needs increase during pregnancy as well. An iodine intake of approximately 250 mcg a day has been proposed for women who are pregnant or lactating and women attempting conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-in-pregnancy#H717782304\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Iodine'</a>.)</p><p>The size of the thyroid gland remains normal during pregnancy; thus, the presence of a goiter should always be investigated. A meta-analysis of studies of thyroid size and function in pregnancy found that thyroid size, estimated by inspection and palpation or measured by ultrasonography, increased only in geographic regions of iodine deficiency, and the increase in average glandular size remained within the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Women undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation (eg, for in vitro fertilization) will have subtle changes in thyroid function that usually fall within the normal reference ranges. Treatment with exogenous gonadotropins results in a rise in serum TBG, T4, and T3 concentrations, a fall in serum free T4 concentration, and a small rise in serum TSH concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Issues related to thyroid function and dysfunction during pregnancy are reviewed in detail separately.

Adrenal steroidogenesis leads to the production of three types of steroids: mineralocorticoids are synthesized in the zona glomerulosa; glucocorticoids are produced in the zona fasciculata; and sex steroids come from the zona reticularis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71558 \">figure 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-steroid-biosynthesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenal steroid biosynthesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The renin-angiotensin system is the primary determinant of adrenal aldosterone secretion, although ACTH and hyperkalemia also play a role. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is stimulated during pregnancy because of the associated reductions in vascular resistance and blood pressure and the progressive decline in vascular responsiveness to angiotensin II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. A striking increase in aldosterone levels is observed by the eighth week of pregnancy and continues to rise to 80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dl</span> in the third trimester, four- to six-fold above the upper limits observed in euvolemic nonpregnant adults. The blood pressure is usually 10 mmHg below baseline in the second trimester, declining to a mean of <span class=\"nowrap\">105/60</span> mmHg. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serum concentrations of progesterone (produced by the placenta), which competes with aldosterone for binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor and therefore has a natriuretic effect, are increased throughout pregnancy, reaching a level of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dl</span> by term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Special interest has been directed towards progesterone because the concentration changes parallel that of aldosterone. Some investigators have postulated that high plasma levels of aldosterone during pregnancy reflect a compensatory response to salt-losing factors, such as progesterone, and the increased filtration of extracellular fluid by the kidney. Numerous studies however, indicate that the action of aldosterone can be separated from that of progesterone. As an example, when sodium balance is perturbed by decreases or increases in dietary sodium there are immediate and appropriate changes in plasma aldosterone levels. At high sodium levels, the aldosterone level falls to values observed in euvolemic pregnant adults, in the presence of high stable plasma levels of progesterone. Therefore, it seems likely that aldosterone is critical in maintaining sodium balance in the setting of dilatation of the peripheral vasculature. This proposal has been strengthened by studies in the rat model of pregnancy, as a result of the direct action of a vasodilating factor called relaxin. This peptide hormone belongs to the insulin family and reproduces the vascular changes that characterize human pregnancy when administered to male animals and castrated females. Relaxin is normally produced in the corpus luteum, but in pregnancy is produced in large amounts by the placenta and decidua.</p><p>Other humoral factors also contribute to volume regulation during pregnancy. The circulating concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide reaches its nadir late in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], when plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone concentrations reach their peak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. These observations are consistent with a state of effective hypovolemia that is presumably due to the fall in blood pressure.</p><p>While adrenal cortisol is under the control of the HPA axis, as noted above, placental CRH increases progressively during the second and third trimester, driving increases in maternal ACTH and free cortisol throughout gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Cortisol-binding globulin increases two- to three-fold during pregnancy so that the total circulating cortisol is increased to a greater degree than the free cortisol concentration.</p><p>Similarly, serum total testosterone concentrations rise in pregnancy because of a sixfold increase in sex hormone-binding globulin. The free testosterone concentration is comparable to the nonpregnant state before the 28th gestational week, but exceeds normal nonpregnant levels in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The androstenedione concentration also increases in the third trimester, while the dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate level falls (despite increased fetal production) because of increased metabolic clearance rate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhibins and activins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhibins and activins are members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) superfamily, a group of structurally similar, but functionally diverse growth factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

In pregnant women, inhibin concentrations are elevated at five weeks of gestation, rise to a peak at 8 to 10 weeks, decrease during the second trimester, and rise again in the third trimester reaching a 48-fold increase near term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

When incubated with myometrial strips, urocortin stimulates uterine contractility by activating specific intracellular pathways.

Homologies with CRF were further demonstrated by the observation that both CRF and urocortin bind to the CRF-binding protein.

High urocortin levels in maternal serum are associated with both term and preterm delivery. Maternal plasma urocortin concentrations are significantly higher in women who deliver preterm than in those who progress to term. Furthermore, in patients who experience preterm delivery, urocortin concentrations are negatively correlated to the delivery time interval and are significantly higher in those delivering earlier in gestation. For prediction of preterm delivery in women with threatened preterm labor, a urocortin threshold of 113.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/ml</span> achieved a sensitivity of 80 percent and a specificity of 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>Urocortin receptors have been found on endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and their activation modulates peripheral vascular resistance by endothelium-dependent (activation of nitric oxide pathway) and endothelium-independent (direct stimulation of vascular smooth muscle relaxation) mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Urocortin concentrations correlate with hemodynamic changes of the blood flow from the mother to the fetus through the placenta, leading to the hypothesis that urocortin may be released in high amounts from fetal sources in the maternal circulation to reduce maternal vascular resistance and to increase the perfusion of the placenta. Thus, it may represent an adaptive fetal response to maternal hypertensive disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>Two additional members of the CRF family have been discovered: urocortin 2 (also known as stresscopin-related peptide) and urocortin 3 (also known as stresscopin), which mediate stress coping responses during the recovery phase of stress.

These hormones affect both glucose and lipid metabolism to ensure that the fetus has an ample supply of fuel and nutrients at all times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>]. In addition, a small part of the physiological maternal weight gain is based on metabolic alterations leading to deposition of fat, protein, and water in the intracellular component. Nutritional requirements in pregnancy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These changes are most important in late pregnancy when there is increased fetal growth and, therefore, demand for nutrients. The maternal response is characterized by a switch from carbohydrate to fat utilization that is facilitated by both insulin resistance and increased plasma concentrations of lipolytic hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. These adaptations are associated with large fluctuations in glucose and insulin as the mother oscillates between the fed and fasted states. The fasted state is one of &quot;accelerated starvation&quot; in which alternative fuels are made available to the mother, while glucose is reserved for the fetus. After an overnight fast, as an example, the maternal fasting capillary whole blood glucose concentration falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>], while plasma ketone and free fatty acid concentrations rise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucose metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbohydrate metabolism in the later part of pregnancy is directed toward supplying glucose and amino acids to the growing fetus, while providing extra free fatty acids, ketones, and glycerol as sources of maternal fuel. Normal pregnancy is characterized by hyperplasia of the insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells, increased insulin secretion, and an early increase in insulin sensitivity followed by progressive insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Insulin and insulin-like growth factors are essential for the regulation of energy metabolism, cell proliferation, tissue development, and differentiation. </p><p>The lactogenic hormones prolactin and chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS; also called human placental lactogen) cause an increase in the number of pancreatic beta cells in pregnancy. The mechanism regulating hyperplasia of the insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells during pregnancy is not well defined. A study in mice showed that lactogenic hormone signaling via the prolactin receptor controls the rate limiting step in serotonin synthesis and that serotonin signaling drives the adaptive expansion of the beta cell mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Another study in mice reported that menin (protein product of the MEN1 gene) was suppressed in normal pregnancy, possibly due to increasing prolactin levels, and that pancreatic islet cell growth was stimulated in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Conversely, expression of menin prevented hyperplasia of the insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells and resulted in gestational diabetes. Fox M1, a transcription factor in beta cell replication, is also required for prolactin induced beta cell expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Insulin levels are higher both in the fasting and postprandial states.

Gestational diabetes mellitus occurs when a woman's pancreatic function is not sufficient to overcome the insulin resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) On the other hand, the pregnancy-associated insulin resistance rapidly decreases during labor, since expulsion of the fetoplacental unit leads to cessation of production of somatomammotropin, which has a short half-life. This has important implications for the woman with type 1 diabetes in whom insulin requirements fall to zero during labor and delivery. The use of myo-inositol and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> seems to positively affect the insulin resistance and glycemic control, and hence gestational diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>].

Consequently, the reduction of maternal adiponectin levels could be a mechanism by which fat tissue stimulates fetal growth through insulin sensitivity, and hence participates in the physiologic mechanism of insulin resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Protein metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant augmentation of protein intake is important in pregnancy to fulfill the needs of the growing fetus, the placenta, and maternal changes, such as the enlarging uterus and breasts and increased volume of blood components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein during pregnancy is based on estimates of the efficiency of protein utilization in pregnant women. It is recommended that pregnant women consume 60 grams of protein per day, which is only 10 grams more than in nonpregnant women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Water metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water retention is a physiological phenomenon in pregnancy, with an average increase at term of 3 liters. Water retention is clinically evident as edema of the ankles and legs, a normal finding in a large proportion of pregnant women near term.</p><p>A fall in plasma osmolality of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> is one of the main reasons for water retention. Antidiuretic hormone release and the osmotic threshold for thirst decrease in parallel resulting in water retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrine adaptations to the pregnant state begin just after conception and evolve through delivery, after which they almost completely revert back to the nonpregnant state over a period of weeks. Pituitary, adrenal and pancreas are glands not frequently affected by pregnancy, while thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism) may result as a permanent condition. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine adaptations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal physiology during pregnancy is significantly affected by placental hormones, which affect glucose and lipid metabolism to ensure that the fetus has an ample supply of fuel and nutrients at all times. An excessive increase of maternal body mass index (BMI) during pregnancy, however, is a risk factor for development of obstetric syndromes (gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, preterm birth), and jeopardizes the woman&rsquo;s future health.
