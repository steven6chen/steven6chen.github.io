The alteration in enzyme activity is usually due to an inherited mutation in the gene for that enzyme.

Almost all of the synthesized heme is utilized as the prosthetic group for hemoglobin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The liver accounts for most of the rest of overall heme synthesis. In the liver, heme is utilized primarily for the production of the various cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). These are especially abundant and inducible in the liver and have high rates of turnover.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other important heme-containing proteins (eg, myoglobin, respiratory cytochromes, catalase, nitric oxide synthase) are present in various tissues, usually in smaller amounts, and most turn over more slowly than the CYPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Enzymes and intermediates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eight enzymes and intermediates that comprise the heme synthetic pathway are shown in the figures, and the important features of these enzymes are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57890 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54358\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54358 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The first enzyme in this pathway, delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS, 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase), is a mitochondrial enzyme that requires pyridoxal-5'-phosphate as a cofactor. It catalyzes the conversion of two simple molecules, glycine and succinyl-coenzyme A to form delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an amino acid committed exclusively to the synthesis of heme.</p><p>Importantly, ALAS occurs in two forms that are encoded by different genes found on different chromosomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54358\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54358 \">table 1</a>). The housekeeping form, which is found in all tissues, is termed ALAS1 (or ALAS-N). The erythroid-specific form, termed ALAS2 (or ALAS-E), is transcribed only in bone marrow erythroblasts.</p><p>The enzymes that follow in the heme synthetic pathway catalyze, in the following order, formation of the pyrrole porphobilinogen (PBG), a linear tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane (HMB), a series of porphyrins (cyclic tetrapyrroles) that undergo stepwise decarboxylations, oxidation from a porphyrinogen to a porphyrin, and finally the insertion of an iron atom into protoporphyrin to form heme (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57890 \">figure 2</a>). With the exception of protoporphyrin, all of the porphyrin intermediates are in their reduced forms, which are termed porphyrinogens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Regulation of heme synthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ALAS1 has a key regulatory role especially in the liver, where it is the rate limiting enzyme for heme synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The human gene encoding this enzyme is localized to chromosome 3p21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A regulatory heme pool controls the synthesis of hepatic ALAS1 and its transport into mitochondria. This provides a sensitive feedback mechanism whereby ALAS1 is up-regulated when the need for heme in the liver is increased, and down-regulated when the heme supply is sufficient.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since most of the heme synthesized in liver is used for the production of CYPs, it is understandable that induction of CYPs by drugs and other factors would also lead to induction of ALAS1 through this feedback mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, the ALAS1 gene and certain CYP genes share upstream enhancer elements that respond to inducing chemicals and interact with the pregnane X receptor (PXR), an additional mechanism for coordinated induction of ALAS1 and hepatic CYPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The regulatory heme pool may also be depleted, and hepatic ALAS1 induced, following induction of hepatic heme oxygenase, which enzymatically degrades heme.</p><p/><p>These feedback mechanisms are important in the acute porphyrias, which are exacerbated when hepatic ALAS1 is induced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. Accordingly, the acute porphyrias may be treated with exogenous heme, which is taken up primarily in hepatocytes, where it repletes the regulatory heme pool, down-regulates ALAS1, and ameliorates the acute attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Heme synthesis in the bone marrow is regulated differently from that in the liver, in order to provide heme in amounts required for hemoglobin synthesis. The gene encoding ALAS2 is localized to chromosome Xp11.21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Unlike ALAS1, whose expression is regulated by the liver heme concentration and inhibited when the free heme concentration is adequate, ALAS2 activity is constitutively expressed in erythroid cells and is upregulated by heme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and by iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The upregulation by iron is due to the presence of a functional iron responsive element in ALAS2 mRNA, which is not present in ALAS1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other enzymes in the heme synthetic pathway are also up-regulated in the bone marrow when hemoglobin synthesis is active.</p><p>The subsequent enzymes in the heme synthetic pathway are described in greater detail in the topic reviews covering each of the individual porphyrias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH ALTERATIONS IN HEME BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY ENZYMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3510243733\"><span class=\"h2\">Gene mutations</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ALA synthase 1</strong> &ndash; Mutations of <em>ALAS1</em> have not been described.

The disease-causing mutation in a particular family is often private or shared with only a few other families.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The hepatic enzyme deficiency in porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), is mostly acquired, although approximately 20 percent of patients with PCT are also heterozygous for a mutation of UROD. Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for UROD mutations is the cause for the rare condition hepatoerythropoietic porphyria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These enzyme deficiencies lead to accumulation of pathway intermediates and diverse clinical manifestations that are either neurological or cutaneous. These excess intermediates or their derivatives can be measured in urine, feces, plasma, and erythrocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80601\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80601 \">table 2</a>) in order to establish a diagnosis of porphyria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Detection of the responsible mutation is useful for confirmation of the diagnosis as well as for family studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental and metabolic influences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to mutations affecting enzymatic activity, heme pathway enzymes may also be affected by environmental and metabolic factors. As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ALA dehydratase (ALAD), the second enzyme in the heme synthetic pathway, is inhibited in lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia type 1. Lead displaces zinc from its binding sites on the enzyme, and succinylacetone (4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid), a metabolite that accumulates in tyrosinemia, is structurally similar to ALA and is a potent inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of ALAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Accordingly, both lead poisoning and tyrosinemia are associated with accumulation of ALA and other heme pathway intermediates, along with symptoms that resemble the acute porphyrias.

If these inducing stimuli are intermittent or cyclic, as in the hormonal changes associated with the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, attacks may occur on an intermittent or cyclic basis.

These classifications are not completely distinct and, in some instances, overlap. As shown in the table, the porphyrias are also classified as hepatic or erythropoietic, depending on whether the site of initial production and accumulation of pathway intermediates is the liver or the bone marrow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80601\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80601 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyrias-an-overview/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute porphyrias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute porphyrias (ie, those with neurovisceral manifestations) include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ALA dehydratase porphyria (ADP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variegate porphyria (VP)</p><p/><p>ADP is neurovisceral only. Skin lesions occur in AIP only with advanced renal disease. HCP and especially VP can have neurovisceral as well as cutaneous manifestations.</p><p>Acute porphyrias present with a variety of nonspecific neurovisceral symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, psychiatric disorders, neurologic symptoms), the most common of which is abdominal pain. These can include potentially life-threatening neurological effects (eg, peripheral motor neuropathy, seizures, coma, bulbar paralysis) and are associated with elevations in the porphyrin precursors delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), and often with red or brownish colored urine. Symptoms usually occur as acute attacks, but are sometimes chronic.

However, for screening purposes, reliance should be placed on a few first-line tests that can rapidly establish or exclude a diagnosis of porphyria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For acute porphyrias, urine porphobilinogen (PBG) is the most important first-line screening test.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For blistering cutaneous porphyrias, plasma or urine porphyrins are the first-line screening test.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For non-blistering cutaneous porphyria (EPP), erythrocyte total protoporphyrin is the initial test.

It is especially important in screening for EPP and XLP to measure total protoporphyrin, and, if this is elevated, to measure the proportions of metal-free and zinc protoporphyrin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 5</a>).
