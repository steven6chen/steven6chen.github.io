Ample evidence demonstrates an important influence of genetic background on the development of adrenal insufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71558 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H240131434\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiadrenal antibodies are more common in women, particularly those with the polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (type 2). Patients with antibodies develop adrenal insufficiency at a rate of up to 19 percent per year. In autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1, or autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) syndrome, the presence of adrenal autoantibodies has a 92 percent predictive value for the development of adrenal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Antiadrenal antibodies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of adrenal insufficiency follows four stages: stage 1, high plasma renin activity and normal or low serum aldosterone; stage 2, impaired serum cortisol response to cosyntropin stimulation; stage 3, increased morning plasma corticotropin (ACTH) with normal serum cortisol; and stage 4, low morning serum cortisol. The serum concentration of autoantibodies, specifically against CYP21A2, correlates strongly with the degree of adrenal dysfunction. Adrenal insufficiency becomes clinically manifest only after <strong>at least 90 percent</strong> of the cortex has been destroyed. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Prediction of adrenal insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies against other endocrine glands are common in patients with autoimmune adrenal insufficiency but rare in normal subjects.

It is somewhat less likely to be familial when it occurs alone. Approximately one-third of such patients have affected family members, as compared with approximately one-half of patients who have adrenal insufficiency as part of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 1 or 2.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'HLA associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gene responsible for polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 1 is located on chromosome 21q22.3. It is termed <em>AIRE</em> (autoimmune regulator) and encodes a protein that is probably a transcription factor. However, the genes for CYP11A1 and CYP17, the other two targets for the antiadrenal antibodies in patients with autoimmune adrenal insufficiency, lie on chromosomes 15q23-q24 and 10q24-q25, respectively. These genes are therefore <strong>not</strong> linked to HLA haplotypes or implicated in the genetic susceptibility to autoimmune adrenalitis.
