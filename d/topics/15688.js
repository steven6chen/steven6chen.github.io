Such compression causes persistent pain and dysfunction. Shoulder pain is a common presenting complaint in primary care clinics, and SIS is likely the most common cause of shoulder pain in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Much has changed in our understanding of shoulder function and dysfunction since Neer's original classification of these disorders decades ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The diagnosis of SIS implies a spectrum of clinical findings, not injury to a specific structure.</p><p>The pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of SIS will be reviewed here. The approach to patients with shoulder pain, the shoulder examination, and conditions that may stem from SIS are discussed elsewhere.

Studies suggest that shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) is the most common cause of shoulder pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. However, epidemiologic calculations can vary depending upon how SIS is defined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repetitive activity at or above the shoulder during work or sports represents the main risk factor for SIS. As with many shoulder disorders, increasing age also predisposes to SIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. SIS is common among athletes who participate in overhead sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. These sports may include swimming, throwing, tennis, weightlifting, golf, volleyball, and gymnastics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Overhead work activities that can increase risk for developing SIS include painting, stocking shelves, and mechanical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=throwing-injuries-biomechanics-and-mechanism-of-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Throwing injuries: Biomechanics and mechanism of injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Instability of the glenohumeral joint can lead to impingement. Such instability allows increased translation of the humeral head and predisposes patients to SIS, particularly if they engage in repetitive overhead activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>].</p><p>Scapular instability and dyskinesis, in addition to glenohumeral joint laxity, also predisposes to impingement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Other risk factors may include upper extremity inflexibility, particular acromion anatomy, and acromioclavicular joint pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Understanding the pathophysiology of shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) depends upon knowledge of shoulder anatomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81764%7EEM%2F54102%7EEM%2F69995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81764 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995 \">figure 1A-C</a>). The anatomy of the shoulder is discussed in detail elsewhere, but aspects of particular importance to SIS are reviewed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and biomechanics'</a>.)</p><p>Movement of the humeral head within the glenoid and of the scapulothoracic articulation achieves motion in multiple planes (ie, flexion, extension, internal rotation, external rotation, abduction, adduction). This impressive range of motion can entail compression of structures within the shoulder, including the four rotator cuff muscles (ie, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis), subacromial bursa, labrum, and biceps tendon (long head). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> below.)</p><p>Compression can occur against the acromion, osteoarthritic change on the undersurface of the acromioclavicular joint, and the coracoacromial arch. The acromion is the lateral projection of the posterior scapular spine, and its morphology may play a role in impingement syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53837\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53837 \">figure 2</a>). The acromion forms an articulation with the lateral clavicle, and this articulation is stabilized by the acromioclavicular, coracoacromial, and coracoclavicular ligaments. The coracoacromial arch is composed of the coracoid, anterior acromion, and the coracoacromial ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The small surface area of the glenoid fossa makes the glenohumeral joint relatively unstable. Stability depends largely on surrounding ligamentous, capsular, tendinous, and muscular structures. Any weakness or dysfunction of these stabilizing structures can increase glenohumeral instability, allowing increased translation of the humeral head. This increased motion makes surrounding structures susceptible to impingement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">General</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) consists of a spectrum of clinical findings, NOT injury to a specific structure (ie, rotator cuff [RC]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This spectrum of disease was first described by Charles Neer in 1972, and consists of the following stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/3,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 1: Edema and hemorrhage (patient generally &lt;25 years)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2: Fibrosis and tendinitis (patient 25 to 40 years). Current term is tendinopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3: RC tear, biceps tendon rupture, bony change (patient generally &gt;40 years)</p><p/><p>The underlying mechanism of injury occurs when the RC, subacromial bursa, and other soft tissues (eg, long biceps tendon) are compressed between the humeral head and the undersurface of the acromion, acromioclavicular joint, or the coracoacromial arch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/15,18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18,21</a>]. A number of anatomic and mechanistic factors play a role in this mechanism, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased translation of the humeral head</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acromion morphology that predisposes to impingement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased distance between undersurface of acromion and humeral head</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteophytic change of the acromioclavicular joint</p><p/><p>Weakness or dysfunction of the structures that stabilize the glenohumeral joint (eg, RC muscles) can lead to increased superior translation of the humeral head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Increased translation can lead to compression of the subacromial bursa and RC tendons, causing injury. This extrinsic compression is one of a number of injuries that contribute to the development of SIS and RC tendinopathy. In addition, a decrease in the distance between undersurface of acromion and humeral head appears to correlate with clinical symptoms in patients with impingement syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The relationship between the anterior third of the acromion and subacromial structures accounts in part for compression and the development of SIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Three acromion types have been described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53837\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53837 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I &ndash; Flat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II &ndash; Curved</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III &ndash; Hooked</p><p/><p>These acromion morphologies were originally defined by their relationship to RC tear, with type III acromions having the highest association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anatomic factors other than superior translation of the humeral head and acromion morphology can also contribute to the development of SIS. Osteophytic change of the acromioclavicular joint can cause compression and mechanical irritation of underlying soft tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The lateral band of the coracoacromial ligament has been implicated in impingement of the RC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/21,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23,24</a>]. Scapulothoracic dysfunction may play a role in SIS, but it remains unclear if such dysfunction is causative or secondary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/17,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Throwing athletes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Throwing athletes suffer from a unique form of SIS. Impingement of the superior and posterior labrum and RC occurs with external rotation, extension, and abduction of the shoulder (ie, the cocking phase of throwing). This motion together with anterior translation of the humeral head causes impingement. Glenohumeral instability accentuates the anterior translation and subsequent impingement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/9,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17</a>]. Repetitive use of the shoulder in extremes of rotation with throwing activities, combined with weakness of the RC and laxity of the glenohumeral ligaments, places athletes at risk for this form of SIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>This form of impingement, sometimes referred to as posterior SIS, does not occur in all overhead athletes, but specifically in throwing athletes whose motion involves a cocking phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98363\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98363 \">figure 3</a>). Such activities include baseball pitching primarily, but also tennis serves, American football throws, and javelin throws.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pain from shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) may result from injury to a number of involved structures, including: the rotator cuff (RC), subacromial bursa, biceps tendon, and labrum. The history and physical examination is used to identify the structures involved and direct treatment.</p><p>It is important to distinguish SIS from RC tear and adhesive capsulitis, for which management differs. RC tears frequently cause weakness in addition to pain, occur most often in older patients, and are associated with a positive drop arm sign and weakness with external rotation. Patients with adhesive capsulitis generally give a history of shoulder injury and manifest restricted active and passive glenohumeral motion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biceps tendinopathy and tendon rupture&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with shoulder impingement can concurrently develop cervical radiculopathy, emphasizing the importance of a careful neurologic examination in patients with shoulder complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

Patients complain of pain with overhead activity. The pain may localize to the deltoid area or lateral arm and often occurs at night or when lying on the affected shoulder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Throwing athletes complain of shoulder stiffness and a difficult or prolonged warm-up period. Pain occurs during the late cocking phase or the early acceleration phase of throwing. Initially, the athlete may not be able to localize the pain, but with time may develop discomfort at the posterior shoulder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Serving athletes (eg, tennis and volleyball players) may complain of pain at follow-through or terminal wrist snap before impingement becomes severe.

Some aspects of management are supported by randomized trials, but many are not and the overall quality of available evidence pertaining to treatment is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A description of the management approach and basic treatment for SIS follows. Issues related to the specific management of SIS, as opposed to RC tendinopathy, are discussed here; evidence for treatments used to manage both SIS and RC tendinopathy is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We approach patients with suspected SIS in the manner described here but recognize that evidence is limited and alternative approaches may be reasonable. We begin with a focused history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above.)</p><p>If based on the history and examination, we suspect a clinically significant RC tear, a labral tear, adhesive capsulitis, or other significant pathology not amenable to conservative therapy; we generally refer the patient to an orthopedic surgeon. We maintain a lower threshold for referral in the case of high-functioning athletes. If we suspect a RC tear or adhesive capsulitis, but the patient has minimal weakness and reasonable motion, we generally embark on a course of conservative medical management, consisting primarily of physical therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=superior-labrum-anterior-posterior-slap-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) tears&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frozen-shoulder-adhesive-capsulitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rehabilitation-principles-and-practice-for-shoulder-impingement-and-related-problems\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rehabilitation principles and practice for shoulder impingement and related problems&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If we suspect acute SIS, we initiate conservative medical management, including the acute treatments described below and an appropriate physical therapy program. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Acute treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Physical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The duration and success of physical therapy depends upon many factors, including underlying pathology, compliance with treatment, and the appropriateness of the program prescribed. We believe that whenever possible, it is important for patients to begin rehabilitation under the guidance of a knowledgeable professional (eg, athletic trainer or physical therapist with experience managing shoulder disorders).</p><p>If function and symptoms improve over several weeks of physical therapy, we have the patient continue therapy and begin a gradual, stepwise resumption of activities, including sports. Should function fail to improve despite adequate rehabilitation, we obtain imaging studies. Musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK US), if not performed previously, may be obtained first. We perform a plain radiograph for persistent symptoms to assess for anatomic variants, such as a downsloping acromion or os acromiale, and acromioclavicular or glenohumeral osteoarthritis. We obtain an MRI if the MSK US is nondiagnostic or not available, a RC or labral tear is suspected, or the diagnosis is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasound-of-the-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the shoulder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Subsequent management depends upon the results of imaging studies. Alternative diagnoses are managed accordingly. We refer patients with RC tears, labral tears, and adhesive capsulitis to an orthopedic surgeon. For RC tendinopathy or subacromial bursitis, we continue conservative management. Some clinicians may choose to incorporate adjunct treatments, such as glucocorticoid injection, at this point, or earlier if pain is severe. Physical therapy may require several months before adequate shoulder function is achieved. We refer the patient to an orthopedic surgeon if, after six to nine months of conservative treatment, patient function and symptoms fail to improve significantly. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic referral'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research to direct management of SIS is limited, but the following is a generally accepted approach for acute symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryotherapy &ndash; Ice may decrease acute swelling and inflammation and provide some analgesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest &ndash; This means avoiding activities that aggravate symptoms, including all overhead activities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) &ndash; For acute injuries, we give a short course (ie, 7 to 10 days) of scheduled NSAID therapy. Thereafter, patients may use an NSAID for occasional analgesia if they find the medication effective. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although studies of physical therapy regimens for SIS are limited, available evidence and our clinical experience suggest that properly designed and performed physical therapy programs effectively treat most patients with SIS and should be implemented prior to surgical referral. Furthermore, several randomized trials have reported no difference in outcome between patients treated with physical therapy alone and those treated surgically with subacromial decompression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>The physical therapy programs used most often for SIS closely resemble those used for rehabilitation of RC tendinopathy and these are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rehabilitation-principles-and-practice-for-shoulder-impingement-and-related-problems\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rehabilitation principles and practice for shoulder impingement and related problems&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A systematic review of randomized trials of conservative interventions for SIS reported the overall quality of studies to be very low, but found specific exercises for the shoulder and scapular muscles to be among the most significant interventions for improving shoulder function (four trials, n = 202; standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.57, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.29) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. One randomized trial of 97 patients diagnosed with SIS reported that those treated with such an exercise regimen had significant improvements in shoulder function and were less likely to undergo surgery than patients treated with standard exercises (20 versus 63 percent; odds ratio [OR] 7.7, 95% CI 3.1-19.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>A rehabilitation program for SIS should follow a progression from an initial focus on restoring mobility, to stability and strength training, and finally to integration of shoulder rehabilitation into overall functional training. A qualified therapist or trainer can help the physician to design and implement an effective rehabilitation program for SIS, which generally includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Range of motion exercises to improve motion in all planes (flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, internal and external rotation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glenohumeral joint mobilization, including specific maneuvers for capsular structures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strengthening exercises, focusing on the RC, scapular stabilizers, and core musculature. Eccentric exercises (application of a load during muscle lengthening) are included in the program.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biomechanical training to improve the throwing motion or other repetitive activity that led to injury. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercises to improve the strength and stability of the core muscles and to integrate shoulder rehabilitation into patient-specific functional activities.</p><p/><p>Overhead athletes should generally refrain from all throwing activities for two to four weeks, while performing physical therapy for the RC and scapular stabilizers. As symptoms resolve, athletes begin a graded return to throwing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Approximately 95 percent of throwing athletes return to their previous level of function if started early on a well-designed rehabilitation program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Nevertheless, the available evidence suggests that stretching and strengthening exercise programs consistent with the guidelines listed above provide effective treatment for SIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/4,6,16,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,16,38,39</a>]. The addition of glenohumeral mobilization exercises to rehabilitation further improves outcomes. One small prospective study found that patients with less acromion-humeral narrowing showed greater functional improvements following physical rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3355819365\"><span class=\"h2\">Taping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kinesio tape (ie, kinesiology tape) is a type of elastic tape that some clinicians apply to specific injured regions with the intention of stimulating improved blood and lymph flow, and kinesthetic sense, and providing support to muscles and tendons. Adjunct treatment with kinesio tape has become popular despite a dearth of high-quality studies supporting its efficacy.&nbsp;A well-designed randomized trial involving 100 patients diagnosed with subacromial impingement reported no added benefit from kinesio tape (or NSAID use) when performed in combination with a short-term exercise program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Studies of taping were included in a more comprehensive meta-analysis of nonsurgical treatments for SIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In this review, tape treatment was found to be superior to sham taping for pain (five studies; n = 272) and short-term functional improvement (three studies; n = 161), but the overall quality of these studies was limited. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Subacromial injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is little evidence to support the use of subacromial injection for the treatment of SIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/6,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,42,43</a>], a few small, randomized trials report a short term benefit from glucocorticoid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-impingement-syndrome/abstract/30,44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,44-47</a>].

Repetitive activity at or above the shoulder during work or sports represents the main risk factor. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SIS consists of a spectrum of clinical findings, NOT injury to a specific structure (ie, rotator cuff [RC]). Increased translation of the humeral head, acromion morphology that predisposes to impingement, and osteophytic change of the acromioclavicular joint all may play a role. Throwing athletes may develop posterior SIS. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to distinguish SIS from RC tear and adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder). RC tears generally cause weakness, occur in older patients, and are associated with a positive drop arm sign and weakness with external rotation. Adhesive capsulitis is associated with a history of shoulder injury and restricted active <strong>and</strong> passive glenohumeral motion. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SIS complain of pain with overhead activity. Examination techniques for the shoulder are sensitive for the presence of SIS, but cannot reliably distinguish among specific causes of pain and dysfunction. In addition to general tests of shoulder motion and strength, the Neer and Hawkins-Kennedy impingement tests are useful. The neck and neurologic function must be carefully examined. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain radiographs are unnecessary for the initial evaluation of suspected SIS. Ultrasound often reveals the site of impingement and tendons involved. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest referring patients for orthopedic evaluation if three months of conservative treatment, including appropriate physical therapy, fails to improve symptoms and function, or if a RC tear, labrum tear, or adhesive capsulitis is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Little evidence exists to guide management of SIS.
