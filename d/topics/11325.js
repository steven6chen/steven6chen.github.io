There is enormous variability in susceptibility to motion sickness, as it may be produced with minimal provocation in some individuals but can be very difficult to elicit in others.</p><p>The symptoms of motion sickness were first described by Hippocrates. They frequently occur during boat travel, and the principal symptom (nausea) is derived from the Greek word for ship (naus).</p><p>This topic discusses the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, treatment and prevention of motion sickness. A possibly related disorder, disembarkment syndrome, and other causes of vertigo and dizziness are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-etiology-and-differential-diagnosis-of-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, etiology, and differential diagnosis of vertigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The brain receives numerous inputs that are used to estimate the motion and spatial orientation of the head. The principal sensory signals that contribute to this process are vestibular cues from the labyrinth, visual information, and somatosensory cues. Afferent information derived from the labyrinth encodes both angular motion (sensed by the semicircular canals) and linear acceleration and gravitational force (sensed by the otolith organs).</p><p>During active movements such as locomotion, the motor command generated by the brain (sometimes referred to as a corollary discharge or efference copy) is also used to estimate the motion of the head and body. During self-generated movements in normal subjects, the motor command and sensory feedback are congruent, and the brain can generate a stable and accurate estimate of head motion and orientation.</p><p>In the absence of active movements, the brain's estimate of motion is primarily based upon vestibular, visual, and somatosensory information. When these three sensory cues are not congruent, a sensory conflict is generated in the brain, and it is hypothesized that this conflict underlies the symptoms of motion sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>As an example, if the visual system indicates that a person is stationary (eg, viewing the interior of a cabin on a ship), but the vestibular system senses ongoing head movements (eg, due to motion of the ship), the vestibular and visual cues conflict and engender symptoms of motion sickness. Furthermore, if the semicircular canals and otolith organs produce sensory cues that are incongruous, motion sickness can be evoked that is independent of vision.</p><p>Similarly, if the visual system indicates movement (eg, moving a microscope slide, engaging in virtual reality games or rides, watching a point-of-view movie) but the vestibular system does not, an illusory sense of motion, referred to as vection, can be evoked. This can sometimes result in motion sickness in the absence of physical movement.</p><p>Labyrinthine inputs are clearly crucial to the development of motion sickness, since experimental animals with inactivated semicircular canals or otolith organs do not develop the syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], nor did a group of deaf subjects who were presumed to lack peripheral vestibular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Conversely, blind subjects have a predilection to motion sickness similar to those with normal vision, suggesting that the contribution of visual information to this syndrome is less critical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Movements that are most likely to elicit motion sickness include low-frequency rotations and translations and novel motion patterns, particularly those involving head rotations about two axes simultaneously (resulting in cross-coupled, or Coriolis, forces) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The anatomic basis for motion sickness is not well understood. It is presumed to depend upon connections between the central vestibular system in the brainstem and cerebellum and the autonomic and emetic centers in the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Projections from the nodulus and uvula of the cerebellum to the brainstem that modulate a central vestibular process referred to as &quot;velocity storage&quot; may be critical for the development of motion sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Histamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine appear to be the critical neurotransmitters involved in the production of motion sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) also plays a role in motion sickness through effects on the velocity storage integrator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Motion sickness can be induced in almost all people with sufficient provocation. Individuals vary in their susceptibility to motion sickness, and certain characteristics show some correlation with this susceptibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient factors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex &ndash; Women are generally more susceptible to motion sickness than men, but the incidence varies substantially with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ndash; Children less than two years old are typically resistant to motion sickness; the incidence peaks at approximately 12 years of age and then decreases throughout adulthood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormonal factors &ndash; Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to motion sickness; susceptibility may also be affected by the menstrual cycle and by use of oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other sensory illness &ndash; Diseases that alter vestibular or visual sensory cues (eg, labyrinthitis) may make subjects more sensitive to head motion and visual stimulation than the normal population. In addition, disorders that increase the sensitivity of the brain to sensory stimuli (eg, migraine) are associated with more prominent symptoms of motion sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine &ndash; Migraine sufferers are more susceptible to motion sickness. In one study, 50 percent of migraine sufferers reported a history of motion sickness versus 20 percent of persons with tension headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Symptoms of motion sickness in migraineurs may be movement or visually induced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A relationship between the trigeminal system and the vestibular nuclei may play a role in both migraine and motion sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. One study of migraine sufferers with motion sickness found that treatment with migraine prophylaxis medications reduced motion sickness as well as migraine and dizziness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Reduced brain serotonin may be important in both motion sickness and migraine. In one study, migraine sufferers and control subjects were given an amino acid drink that contained or omitted L-tryptophan (required for the synthesis of serotonin), after which motion sickness was induced by the visual illusion of movement. Tryptophan depletion (reduced brain serotonin) resulted in increased symptoms of motion sickness in the control group to levels similar to that of the migraineurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In a small randomized pilot study, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rizatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rizatriptan</a>, a triptan serotonin agonist, prevented the development of motion sickness symptoms in patients with migrainous vertigo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial &ndash; Expectations and other psychological factors may affect the risk of motion sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A controlled trial found that naval cadets who were told they were unlikely to experience seasickness were at decreased risk of developing motion sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental factors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of motion &ndash; As discussed above, low-frequency motion and certain directions of motion are more likely to induce motion sickness. In a study of air travelers, the magnitude of low-frequency lateral and vertical motion was associated with motion sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body position &ndash; Lying supine, at least on a ship, may decrease susceptibility to motion sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food &ndash; There are conflicting data on whether eating and drinking (and the type of food or drink) affect the risk of motion sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/27,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29-31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Motion sickness can be induced in nearly all adults, so the incidence of motion sickness depends upon the specific conditions encountered. The following observations illustrate the findings in different settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 20,029 passengers on 114 voyages at sea (six ships, two hovercraft, and one jet foil), 7 percent experienced vomiting, 21 percent felt &quot;slightly unwell,&quot; 4 percent felt &quot;quite ill,&quot; and 4 percent felt &quot;absolutely dreadful&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 923 passengers on 38 commercial airline flights, 0.5 percent reported vomiting, 8.4 percent reported nausea, and 16.2 percent reported illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The syndrome of motion sickness is easily recognized, since it includes stereotypic symptoms in the setting of passive motion or in the setting of visual perception of motion without actual movement (vection).</p><p>The principal symptoms are a nonvertiginous sense of dizziness, nausea, belching, increased salivation, warmth, and diaphoresis, and a general feeling of malaise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/15,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,32</a>]. The initial symptoms may be reported as a sense of being aware of one's stomach. Hyperventilation is a common associated feature and can induce dyspnea, paresthesias, and feelings of impending doom.</p><p>Physical signs usually cannot be detected, although pallor may be present. Subtle autonomic changes can be quantified with appropriate testing and include increased perspiration, slowing of gastric emptying, and postural hypotension.</p><p>Motion sickness tends to improve or resolve with repeated exposure to the inciting stimulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a study of pilots undergoing flight simulator training, 47 percent of pilots reported motion sickness during their first flight and 24 percent during their last flight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Symptoms typically subside after 36 to 72 hours of continuous exposure to a stimulus, but they can recur on returning to the pre-exposure environment (ie, returning to land after a sea voyage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT AND PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of interventions can be used to prevent or alleviate motion sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Treatments may be more effective when used for prevention rather than after symptoms have developed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since conflicting sensory cues are believed to induce the symptoms of motion sickness, a straightforward treatment approach is to minimize the discrepancy between these cues. If visual and vestibular information are congruent, motion sickness is less likely to occur.</p><p>Labyrinthine cues cannot be readily manipulated, so this approach is based on providing visual information that contains equivalent motion information to that sensed by the vestibular system. Since the labyrinth senses motion in an inertial (earth-fixed) reference frame, this can be accomplished by viewing an earth-fixed environment during motion rather than a head-fixed environment. As an example, motion sickness on a ship is reduced if passengers view the horizon or land masses from the deck rather than their cabin. Similarly, passengers in a car should sit in the front seat and look through the window rather than sitting in the rear and focusing on an object moving with the interior of the car (such as a book).</p><p>Motion sickness does not occur during self-generated movements under normal conditions, so a second way to reduce the susceptibility to these symptoms is to control the motion of the vehicle. The driver of a car is less prone to motion sickness than a passenger, presumably because the driver's brain can utilize the motor commands related to controlling the car to predict in an approximate manner the motion of the head.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug therapies can be used to suppress conflicting sensory cues in the brain regions that process afferent signals or to treat nausea. In general, the effectiveness of medications depends upon inhibition of activity in the vestibular nuclei, where labyrinthine and visual sensory cues are combined and synthesized. Drugs that reduce activity in the vestibular nuclei include antihistamines, anticholinergics, and benzodiazepines; other medications that reduce motion sickness include antidopaminergics and sympathomimetics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67413\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67413 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/15,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,36</a>].</p><p>In general, medications should be taken before passive motion begins, since they are less effective in relieving symptoms that have already developed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Antihistamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of antihistamines can be used to treat motion sickness, and their effect is probably related to their anticholinergic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Dimenhydrinate is available as a chewable tablet. Cinnarizine is not available in the United States but is widely used in other countries.</p><p>Side effects are mainly related to anticholinergic effects and can include sedation, blurred vision, mouth dryness, and, in older adults, confusion and urinary retention. One small study suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclizine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclizine</a> may be less sedating than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimenhydrinate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dimenhydrinate</a> at a dose that is equally effective for symptoms of motion sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Nonsedating antihistamines do not appear to be effective for the treatment of motion sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motion-sickness/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Anticholinergics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Scopolamine</a> is commonly used for the management of motion sickness.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms include a nonvertiginous sense of dizziness, nausea, belching, increased salivation, warmth, diaphoresis, and a general feeling of malaise. With continuous exposure to a stimulus, symptoms typically subside over 36 to 72 hours. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals can prevent or treat motion sickness by keeping visual cues congruous with vestibular cues. This can be achieved by looking at the outside world's frame of reference (ie, sit in the front seat and look out the front window in a car or view the horizon from the deck of a ship). Activities that maintain vision within a local frame of reference are particularly provocative for motion sickness (eg, reading a book or watching a video or movie). Self-generated movements do not induce motion sickness, and controlling the motion of a vehicle (eg, driving) reduces the likelihood of motion sickness. Lying supine can decrease motion sickness. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Environmental modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications with anticholinergic effects (including sedating antihistamines) are most commonly used for treatment of motion sickness; nonsedating antihistamines are not effective. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meclizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Meclizine</a> is probably less sedating than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimenhydrinate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dimenhydrinate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> at an equally effective dose; as a result, the choice of antihistamine can be based in part on whether or not sedation is desired. Transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a> is effective, and a patch can be worn continuously for 72 hours. Caution must be taken when using medications with anticholinergic effects in older adults or in patients at risk for angle-closure glaucoma. Other medications can also be used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67413\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67413 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Medication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative treatments are often considered for motion sickness. Randomized trials suggest that 1 to 2 grams of ginger may help prevent motion sickness. There is conflicting evidence on acupressure, but acupressure is safer than many other treatments, and some patients report finding it helpful.
