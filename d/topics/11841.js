Epilepsy is a condition characterized by recurrent seizures.</p><p>While it is estimated that 0.5 to 1 percent of the population has epilepsy, nearly 25 percent of patients seen in epilepsy clinic and monitoring units do not have epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. It is important for clinicians to recognize these transient nonepileptic events that may resemble seizures in order to avoid unnecessary treatment with antiseizure drugs and to institute the correct treatment when appropriate.</p><p>The symptoms of epileptic seizures are diverse. As a result, disorders that might be considered in the differential diagnosis will vary depending on the patient's specific clinical presentation. Clearly, not all of these disorders are considered in any one patient.</p><p>Nonepileptic paroxysmal events that can be mistaken for epilepsy also differ significantly by age group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81289\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81289 \">table 1</a>). This topic will review those diagnoses in adolescents and young adults. These diagnoses can be classified into six broad categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychologic disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paroxysmal movement disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miscellaneous neurologic events</p><p/><p>Nonepileptic paroxysmal events in other age groups are reviewed separately.

It is common to confuse seizure and syncope as the cause of an isolated or episodic loss of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>], especially but not exclusively when the episode is not witnessed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful clinical history is important in distinguishing syncope from epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Important features are not always volunteered and must be specifically solicited.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical setting &ndash; Epileptic seizures and syncope can occur in any setting and are usually unprovoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Vasovagal syncope tends to occur in the setting of a strong emotional or painful stimulus, but may also occur with more subtle stimuli, including a hot environment. Reflex syncopes occur with specific stimuli (eg, micturition, cough). Events in the setting of exertion suggest syncope related to structural cardiac disease. Except when caused by a cardiac arrhythmia, it is unusual for syncope to occur when the patient is supine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warning symptoms&nbsp;(aura, prodrome) &ndash; In vasovagal syncope, a prodrome of presyncope is the rule. These patients may note lightheadedness, warmth, nausea, and a gradual fading or tunneling of binocular vision. By contrast, symptoms of olfactory hallucinations or deja vu suggest a seizure aura. However, not all epileptic seizures include a seizure aura. Cardiogenic syncope typically occurs without warning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms &ndash; Pallor and diaphoresis strongly suggest syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, it is unusual for syncope to be associated with lateral tongue biting, head or eye turning to one side, or hypersalivation; these suggest epileptic seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/7,9,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,11-13</a>]. Urinary incontinence can occur in both seizures and syncope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor activity &ndash; While motor activity during an episode of unconsciousness often suggests a seizure diagnosis, brief motor activity, including tonic extension of the trunk and limbs or several clonic jerks, can occur in uncomplicated syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The severity of convulsive symptoms in syncope varies from subtle signs that are often overlooked to more dramatic symptoms that mimic an epileptic seizure. Relatively few bystanders witnessing syncopal attacks report convulsive symptoms, but clinicians systematically observing attacks (eg, during tilt table testing, invasive cardiac electrophysiologic testing, blood drawing) describe convulsive symptoms in up to half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/6,11,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,15-17</a>]. Convulsions are more likely to occur with more prolonged and more severe cerebral hypoperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during syncopal events usually demonstrate generalized slowing followed by high-voltage frontal delta activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Flattening of the EEG can follow if cerebral hypoperfusion persists. It is at this stage that nonepileptic, seizure-like movements are most often described. It has been suggested that these movements may represent a brainstem-release phenomenon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The combination of seizure-like motor activity in the setting of syncope is sometimes referred to as &quot;convulsive syncope.&quot; While these convulsions are common in syncope, a true epileptic seizure (&quot;anoxic seizure&quot;) is rare, except in susceptible people or those with prolonged cerebral ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recovery of consciousness &ndash; Patients usually wake up quickly after a syncopal event. Prolonged confusion or lethargy lasting several minutes or longer favors seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasovagal syncope is the most prevalent cause of syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This often occurs in response to clinical setting (eg, painful procedures, blood drawing, warm setting). In susceptible individuals, autonomic activation leads to a hyperactive parasympathetic cardioinhibitory response <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a diminished sympathetic response leading to vasodepression and syncope. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reflex syncope in adults and adolescents: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiogenic syncope related to either tachy- or bradyarrhythmias is less common but carries a more ominous prognosis. These events are usually unprovoked. Structural heart disease (eg, aortic stenosis) can also lead to syncope by obstructing blood flow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies#H94450988\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiologies&quot;, section on 'Cardiac arrhythmias'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In rare cases, epileptic seizures can induce a cardiac arrhythmia. The most commonly described of these phenomena is an ictal bradycardia in the setting of a temporal lobe seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperventilation with hypocapnia can also lead to syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In this age group, this is most commonly seen in the setting of a panic attack. The presumed mechanism involves respiratory alkalosis causing cerebral vasoconstriction, which in turn decreases cerebral blood flow, causing syncope. Patients often have prodromal complaints of dyspnea, circumoral or acral paresthesias, and visual phosphenes. Tetany, muscle cramps, carpopedal spasm, and chest pain can also occur. A three-minute trial of hyperventilation may induce similar symptoms and aid in diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Panic attacks'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthostatic hypotension is more common in older adults than in younger adults, but should be excluded when convulsive syncope is considered in the differential diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a systolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 10 mmHg after three minutes of standing. Syncope occurs in the setting of either prolonged standing or a sudden assumption of upright posture. In a first attack, acute blood loss should be excluded. Autonomic neuropathy from diabetes and antihypertensive drugs are some of the more common causes of recurrent episodes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-causes-and-evaluation-of-orthostatic-hypotension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms, causes, and evaluation of orthostatic hypotension&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reflex syncope (eg, micturition and cough syncope, carotid sinus hypersensitivity) refers to events that are believed to reflect vagal hypersensitivity to specific stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These diagnoses are suggested by the specific provocation under which they occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiologies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features described above are helpful in distinguishing syncope from seizure. One study found that, among 539 patients in whom all clinical data could be determined, a point score rating these features correctly classified 94 percent of patients as to syncope versus seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, in many cases, these features are unclear or equivocal, and testing is required. </p><p>After a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, creatine kinase (CK) levels are often elevated, and may remain so for several hours or a day. This is unusual in syncope, unless the event was associated with myocardial infarction, in which case the CK elevations are proportionately greater in the MB isoenzyme fraction, rather than the MM fraction, reflecting cardiac rather than skeletal muscle. Serum prolactin levels, however, are not a useful test to distinguish between syncope and seizure, as elevations can occur in either. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Because the prevalence of syncope in the emergency department is far higher than that of seizures, the positive predictive value of EEG abnormalities is low, rendering EEG testing of questionable use in this setting. Only if the EEG captures an event will it help confirm or refute seizures.</p><p>While an interictal EEG has limited utility in differentiating syncope and epileptic seizure, EEG monitoring can be helpful, especially if an ictus is captured. This usually requires recurrent events and prolonged EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring.</p><p>Other testing that can be helpful in the differentiating syncope from seizures includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tilt table testing can provoke vasovagal syncope and provide support for this diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/6,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25</a>]. Confirmation that the induced spell is representative of the episode(s) being evaluated can help avoid a false-positive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reflex syncope in adults and adolescents: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECG or Holter monitoring can be helpful in identifying cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In rare patients with epilepsy and arrhythmia, combined EEG and ECG monitoring can be useful to identify the primary event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Long-term cardiac monitoring techniques can be used for patients with infrequent, recurrent attacks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-ecg-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory ECG monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected syncope is discussed in detail separately.

While often categorized under somatoform or dissociative disorders, PNES probably have a heterogeneous psychiatric pathogenesis. Patients display episodes that superficially resemble epileptic seizures, but are often atypical in one or more of their features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77773\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77773 \">table 2</a>). Video-EEG monitoring is usually required for diagnosis.</p><p>PNES are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Panic attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Panic attacks usually occur in individuals with an underlying anxiety disorder. Attacks are variable in duration (minutes to hours) and can include palpitations, dyspnea, chest pain, presyncope, and a sense of impending doom. Patients often manifest hyperventilation, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and tremulousness during the attack. In rare circumstances, hyperventilation can lead to a brief loss of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p>When not clearly precipitated by stressful circumstances or when associated with feelings of depersonalization or derealization, panic attacks may be mistaken for seizures. Similarly, seizures can be mistaken for panic attacks because anxiety is a common comorbid condition in individuals with epilepsy, and fear can be an ictal symptom, particularly in temporal lobe epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy'</a>.)</p><p>Features that help distinguish epileptic seizures from panic attacks include their short duration (less than two minutes), stereotyped nature, abrupt onset, motor automatisms, unresponsiveness, and postictal lethargy, all of which are atypical for panic attacks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Episodic dyscontrol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with episodic dyscontrol, also called intermittent explosive disorder (IED), display episodes of rage and violence. This disorder usually presents in teenagers and young adults, although it can occur in younger children as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Behavior exhibited during these episodes can appear as though the individual is &quot;out of control.&quot; Other features of the episodes that resemble epileptic seizures include their abrupt onset, often without apparent precipitant, and their short duration, often followed by fatigue and remorse. However, the directed violence of these episodes is rarely a feature of epileptic seizures.</p><p>There is a somewhat high prevalence of nonspecific EEG abnormalities in patients with IED, perhaps reflecting an underlying brain pathology; however, a neurobiologic mechanism of this disorder is not defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SLEEP DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of their episodic and often paroxysmal nature, parasomnias and other sleep disorders may be confused with epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. An exclusive nighttime occurrence of events may suggest a sleep disorder, but does not exclude epilepsy, as this is a characteristic of certain epileptic disorders such as nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/11,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,33</a>]. Epilepsy and sleep disorders can also co-occur. As an example, disorders of arousal (eg, sleepwalking, confusional arousals) are common in patients with nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy and their relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

The tetrad of clinical features includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Excessive daytime sleep</strong> &ndash; Irresistible sleepiness can culminate in a &quot;sleep attack,&quot; in which sleep onset can occur while talking, driving, or walking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cataplexy</strong> &ndash; This sudden loss of muscle tone with preserved consciousness can be mistaken for an atonic seizure. This can result in falls and brief paralysis, but more often is limited to buckling of the knees and slurring of speech. The attacks are classically precipitated by strong emotion, most commonly laughter, but also anger, fear, surprise, or excitement; this feature helps distinguish these attacks from an epileptic seizure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleep paralysis</strong> &ndash; An inability to move or speak, sleep paralysis typically occurs upon awakening or falling asleep and lasts less than 10 minutes. Sometimes, the episodes resolve when someone touches the patient. These can be very frightening to the patient who maintains consciousness throughout the event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypnagogic hallucination</strong> &ndash; This is usually a visual and less often a somatosensory, auditory, vestibular, or olfactory hallucination that occurs while falling asleep or on awakening. The content can be simple (a brief image of a face) or complex (an entire scene occurring in the room). The patient is fully aware during the episode. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Etiologies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Only 10 to 15 percent of patients with narcolepsy experience all of these symptoms. When daytime sleep attacks, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis occur as isolated features, they may be mistaken for epilepsy and vice versa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) aid in the diagnosis, showing decreased sleep latency and decreased REM latency in patients with narcolepsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99090354\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypnic jerks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people have experienced a sudden jerking movement upon falling asleep, often accompanied by a subjective sensation of falling. This phenomenon, also known as benign hypnic myoclonus or sleep starts, is usually easily recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Rarely, hypnic jerks can become unusually violent, very frequent, or repetitive, and confused for myoclonic seizures or even tonic-clonic seizures. The phenomenon is restricted to sleep, and always or virtually always in the transition between sleep and wakefulness, and is not associated with other phenomena.

Tics are associated with a premonitory feeling that is relieved by performing the tics. Unlike other hyperkinetic dyskinesias and unlike epileptic seizures, tics may be temporarily suppressed. Tics also differ from epilepsy by the variability of the movement and the urge to perform tics.

Similar to tics, stereotypies may be consciously suppressed and decreased by distraction. Unlike tics, stereotypies are not preceded by a progressive urge or relief following the activities. Often, they manifest as self-stimulating behaviors in response to tension and anxiety and may comfort the patient. Stereotypies may occur alone or may be secondary to trauma, drugs (eg, chronic amphetamine abuse), or toxic-metabolic insult.

The abnormal smell perception may occur episodically, when certain airborne aromatic molecules interact with injured receptors. As a result, dysosmia can appear unprovoked, random, and recurrent, and as such, may be reported as an olfactory hallucination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

It is also unusual for a hallucination to be the sole manifestation of epilepsy in any given patient; these typically occur as seizure auras, followed by other ictal manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/82,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,84</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Schizophrenia and psychotic depression are usually associated with auditory hallucinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. While other sensory modalities may be involved, auditory hallucinations are usually also present. Distinguishing features of these hallucinations include their personal (often sinister) meaning for the patient, who usually lacks insight as to their unreal nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>].

In difficult cases, electroencephalography (EEG), particularly video-EEG monitoring, is useful.

A careful history is important in distinguishing syncope from seizure. Key aspects of the history include the clinical setting, warning symptoms, associated symptoms, the quality of motor activity, if present, and the speed of recovery of consciousness. EEG is of limited utility unless an event is captured. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Syncope'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychologic disorders that can mimic seizure include psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), panic attacks, and episodic dyscontrol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychogenic-nonepileptic-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Psychological disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parasomnias, sleep-related movement disorders, and narcolepsy may be confused with epilepsy when events occur at night. Specific features of the events, including duration, frequency, timing, stereotypy, and vocalizations, can help distinguish nocturnal seizures from sleep disorders. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Sleep disorders'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Movement disorders are rarely confused with seizures if the motor activity is classic in appearance and is sustained rather than episodic. Confusion can arise when movement disorders present with episodic symptoms, and when focal epileptic seizures are characterized by isolated dystonic posturing or have continuous symptoms (epilepsia partialis continua). A video-EEG recording of events is invaluable in difficult cases. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Movement disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine and epilepsy share overlapping features. Both are characterized by episodes of neurologic dysfunction that may be accompanied by headache, as well as gastrointestinal, autonomic, and psychologic features.
