The subtypes of bipolar disorder include bipolar I and bipolar II. Patients with bipolar I disorder experience manic episodes, and nearly always experience hypomanic and major depressive episodes. Bipolar II disorder is marked by at least one hypomanic episode, at least one major depressive episode, and the absence of manic episodes. Additional information about the clinical features and diagnosis of bipolar disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H4503550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Despite clinical differences among manic and hypomanic episodes (eg, hypomania is less severe than mania), for the purpose of treatment they are considered to be similar and thus treated with the same medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. </p><p>Pharmacotherapy for manic episodes depends upon their severity. Although there are no established criteria that demarcate severe episodes from mild to moderate illness, we classify episodes as severe if they include any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suicidal ideation or behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homicidal ideation or behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotic features (ie, delusions or hallucinations)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor judgement that places the patient or others at imminent risk of being harmed &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H324798\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite clinical differences between manic and hypomanic episodes (eg, hypomania is less severe than mania), for the purpose of treatment they are considered to be similar and thus treated with the same medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H324989\"><span class=\"h2\">Goal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of treating acute mania and hypomania is remission, which is defined as resolution of the mood symptoms or improvement to the point that only one or two symptoms of mild intensity persist. If psychotic features (delusions or hallucinations) are also present, resolution of the psychosis is required for remission. Patients with subsyndromal symptoms of mania are at increased risk of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>For patients who do not achieve remission, a reasonable goal is response, which is defined as stabilization of the patient&rsquo;s safety and substantial improvement in the number, intensity, and frequency of mood (and psychotic) symptoms. A standardized rating scale, such as the Young Mania Rating Scale, can be used to quantify response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], although this is not standard clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of mood elevated syndromes (ie, manic and hypomanic episodes) begins with an initial psychiatric history and mental status examination that emphasizes symptoms of the mood episode, particularly risk of suicide, aggressiveness, and violence to others, as well as signs of catatonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The assessment should also pursue comorbid disorders (eg, substance use disorders) that require treatment. The evaluation includes a general medical history, physical examination, and focused laboratory studies to establish whether the mood syndrome is due to the direct physiologic effects of a general medical condition, and to rule out any contraindications to treatment (eg, renal impairment and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, or hepatic disease and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>). Additional information about the assessment for bipolar disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H4503536\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who suffer mania or hypomania during maintenance pharmacotherapy should be assessed for adherence to treatment and are initially treated by optimizing medication doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/7,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,11</a>]. This includes ensuring serum concentrations are in the therapeutic range for medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>, as well as increasing the dose to achieve a higher serum level within the therapeutic range, provided that side effects do not intervene. For medications that do not have an established therapeutic serum concentration, such as second-generation antipsychotics, the dose can be increased within the target dose range. &#160;</p><p>Substances may cause or exacerbate a mood elevated syndrome. Thus, antidepressants should be abruptly discontinued, and patients should discontinue drugs of abuse and reduce or eliminate their use of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. </p><p>Evidence for the efficacy of treating mood elevated syndromes is primarily based upon randomized trials with bipolar I manic patients; the majority of trials included some patients with mixed features (ie, mania accompanied by symptoms of depression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Even though bipolar II disorder is more prevalent than bipolar I disorder, relatively little research has focused specifically on treating hypomania [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Many randomized trials either exclude patients with bipolar II disorder or combine them with bipolar I patients in the analyses. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H226715056\"><span class=\"h3\">Setting and monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment setting for manic or hypomanic patients depends upon the severity of symptoms, comorbid psychopathology (eg, substance use disorder), level of psychosocial functioning, and available support: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inpatient</strong> &ndash; Hospitalization may be required for managing the patient&rsquo;s safety and symptoms such as suicidal ideation with a specific plan and intent, delusions or hallucinations, and poor judgment that poses an imminent risk to the patient and others </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Partial hospital</strong> &ndash; Moderately ill patients can often be treated in a partial hospital (day) program, including patients with suicidality that does not pose an imminent risk (eg, patients with fleeting thoughts of killing oneself, vague or nonexistent plans, and no intent) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Outpatient</strong> &ndash; Outpatient care may be suitable for less acutely ill patients (eg, patients with thoughts that family members would be better off if the patient was dead, with no plan or intent to commit suicide)</p><p/><p>For outpatient treatment of bipolar disorder, specialized mood disorder clinics may be preferable to general (standard) psychiatric clinics early in the course of illness. An open label, two year, randomized trial compared a mood disorder clinic (staffed by a cross-disciplinary team who administered pharmacotherapy and group psychoeducation) with standard care (pharmacotherapy provided at a local community health center or at a psychiatrist&rsquo;s office) in 158 bipolar patients who were discharged from their first, second, or third inpatient admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Readmission to the hospital occurred in fewer patients who received specialized care than standard care (36 versus 55 percent). In addition, the median duration of the readmission was nearly two times shorter for patients who had received specialized care rather than standard care (12 versus 22 days). &#160; </p><p>The frequency of assessment generally ranges from daily to monthly, depending upon the severity of persistent symptoms. Hospitalized patients are monitored daily, and patients with active suicidal ideation, a specific plan, and intent to kill themselves may require constant observation. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259902796\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug classes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon randomized trials, drug classes commonly used to treat acute mania or hypomania include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticonvulsants </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antipsychotics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benzodiazepines </p><p/><p>The mainstays of treatment are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics used in combination pharmacotherapy (eg, lithium plus an antipsychotic) or as monotherapy, depending upon the severity of symptoms. Benzodiazepines are primarily used as adjunctive treatment for insomnia, agitation, or anxiety. Treatment of insomnia, agitation, and anxiety are discussed separately.

However, most randomized trials last three weeks, and the superior efficacy of active drugs compared with placebo generally begins to manifest within one week. </p><p>In a randomized trial that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> in patients with pure mania or mania with mixed features, improvement at week one was evaluated as a predictor of either remission or response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;50 percent) at week three [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among 234 patients with improvement &ge; 25 percent at week one, 52 percent remitted and 71 percent responded at week three. Conversely, of the 40 patients with &lt;25 percent improvement at week one, 5 percent remitted and 25 percent responded at week three.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259901050\"><span class=\"h3\">Predictors of response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with mania, clinical factors that consistently predict a good response to pharmacotherapy have not been identified. As an example, several studies suggest that mixed features are associated with a poorer response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/14,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18,19</a>]; one randomized trial found that among 36 manic patients who were assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, response was worse in patients (n = 14) with depressive symptoms than patients with pure mania [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. However, other studies found that response to medications was comparable for patients with pure mania and mania with mixed features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>Patients who discontinue successful maintenance treatment and then suffer a relapse are often restarted on the same medication. Although concerns have been raised that the same medication is less effective after treatment is interrupted, a meta-analysis of three prospective observational studies (n = 212 patients with bipolar disorder) suggested that this was not the case.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7954915\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe manic episodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe manic or mixed episodes are characterized by suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior, aggressiveness, psychotic features (ie, delusions or hallucinations), and poor judgement that places the patient or others at imminent risk of being harmed.

We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> plus an antipsychotic; however, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> plus an antipsychotic is a reasonable alternative. We generally combine lithium or valproate with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> (or another first-generation antipsychotic), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>.

No head-to-head trials have compared antipsychotics in combination with lithium or valproate. Thus, the choice between lithium and valproate, and the choice of an antipsychotic is based upon other factors, including past response to medications, side effect profiles, comorbid general medical conditions, potential for drug-drug interactions, drug preparation (eg, intramuscular or oral disintegrating), patient preference, and cost. </p><p>Evidence for the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> plus an antipsychotic includes a review of 20 randomized trials, which estimated that the rate of response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;50 percent) with lithium or valproate plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> was 20 percent higher compared with lithium or valproate alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

After target serum levels have been achieved, levels should be checked at 6 to 12 month intervals, and are particularly useful in patients receiving medications that affect valproate concentrations and to confirm problems with adherence. Some patients may not require regular valproate levels, and one review concluded that clinical observation of efficacy and toxicity can be used to guide some dose adjustments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-mania-and-hypomania/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>Common side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> include weight gain, nausea, vomiting, hair loss, easy bruising, and tremor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59755 \">table 4</a>).

Patients with bipolar I disorder experience manic episodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91106\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106 \">table 1</a>), and nearly always experience hypomanic episodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107 \">table 2</a>) and major depressive episodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91398\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91398 \">table 3</a>). Bipolar II disorder is characterized by at least one episode of hypomania and one or more episodes of major depression. (See <a href=\"#H259896878\" class=\"local\">'Definition of bipolar disorder'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H4503550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients presenting with acute mania or hypomania should be assessed for risk of suicide and homicide, aggressiveness, psychotic features, and poor judgement. Antidepressants should be discontinued, and substance abuse treated. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug classes commonly used to treat acute mania or hypomania include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines. (See <a href=\"#H259902796\" class=\"local\">'Drug classes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe manic episodes, we suggest initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> plus an antipsychotic, rather than monotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2269895045\" class=\"local\">'First line medication combinations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H244584\" class=\"local\">'Medication doses and side effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For resistant patients with severe mania that does not respond to one medication combination (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> plus an antipsychotic), we suggest additional medication combination trials rather than electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Lithium is switched to valproate (or vice versa), and the antipsychotic is switched to another antipsychotic from among <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>.

(See <a href=\"#H7956632\" class=\"local\">'Refractory patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with acute hypomania or mild to moderate mania, we suggest initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> monotherapy rather than other drugs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
