Molar pregnancy is part of a group of diseases classified as gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD), which originate in the placenta and have the potential to locally invade the uterus and metastasize. The pathogenesis of GTD is unique because the maternal tumor arises from gestational rather than maternal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>HM is made up of two distinct entities, complete hydatidiform mole and partial hydatidiform mole. These differ on the basis of chromosomal pattern, gross and microscopic histopathology, clinical presentation, and outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Molar pregnancies, although benign, are considered to be premalignant because they have the potential to develop into a malignancy. Malignant disease is referred to as gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN); the histologic entities included in this group are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive mole</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choriocarcinoma </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placental site trophoblastic tumor </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor </p><p/><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of HM will be reviewed here.

It can be categorized as complete mole or partial mole, which differ by gross morphology, histopathology, karyotype, and risk of malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97543 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>HM occurs after an aberrant fertilization, not after a nonmolar pregnancy (spontaneous or induced abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or preterm or term delivery). Molar pregnancies originate in villous trophoblast and are characterized by abnormal chorionic villi with trophoblast hyperplasia as a consequence of overexpression of paternal genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>Complete moles are diploid and partial moles are triploid. Complete moles typically produce higher levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). </p><p>The risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), malignant disease, is higher for complete than partial mole. GTN, usually invasive mole (IM), develops in 15 to 20 percent of women with complete mole and 1 to 5 percent of women following partial mole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. </p><p>Patients with prior molar pregnancy make up the large majority of the cases of GTN. GTN includes IM, choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor, and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor. These entities represent malignant disease because of the potential for local invasion and metastases. This topic is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-risk-stratification#H14900522\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia: Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, staging, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'Classification and clinical behavior'</a>.) </p><p>The histopathology of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-trophoblastic-disease-pathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational trophoblastic disease: Pathology&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2161400197\"><span class=\"h2\">Complete hydatidiform mole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 80 percent of complete moles are homozygous 46XX, resulting from duplication of the haploid genome of a single sperm following fertilization of an ovum in which the maternal chromosomes are lost during meiosis, or as a consequence of postzygotic diploidization of a triploid conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,8</a>]. Approximately 20 percent of complete moles arise by dispermic fertilization of an ovum and may be 46XX or 46XY. However, while complete moles are generally androgenetic because nuclear DNA is paternally derived, mitochondrial DNA is still maternal in origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Rarely, complete moles are biparental and are associated with an autosomal recessive condition predisposing to molar pregnancy. These patients often have recurrent HMs and may require ovum donation to achieve a livebirth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-trophoblastic-disease-pathology#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational trophoblastic disease: Pathology&quot;, section on 'Complete mole genetics'</a>.)</p><p>The marked elevation in hCG associated with a complete mole results in some of the clinical features of this condition. These include ovarian enlargement due to theca lutein cysts, hyperemesis gravidarum, early development of preeclampsia (before 20 weeks of gestation), and hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2161399357\" class=\"local\">'Less common or late features'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'hCG'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2161400203\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial hydatidiform mole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Partial moles are triploid, usually resulting from fertilization of an apparently normal ovum by two sperm or occasionally by a diploid sperm, and may therefore be 69XXX, 69XXY, or 69XYY [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. The existence of diploid partial mole is unlikely, with most reported cases representing misdiagnosed complete moles, hydropic abortions, or twin pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Partial moles are the only type of GTD that are associated with the presence of a fetus, and fetal cardiac activity may be detected. However, there is a high rate of intrauterine death related to triploidy. Thus, a partial mole is often misdiagnosed as an incomplete or missed abortion, and the correct diagnosis is made only after pathology review of the surgical specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-trophoblastic-disease-pathology#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational trophoblastic disease: Pathology&quot;, section on 'Partial mole genetics'</a>.)</p><p>Partial mole results in hCG levels that are generally lower than in complete mole, and thus is less likely to be associated with sequelae of hCG stimulation. (See <a href=\"#H2161399357\" class=\"local\">'Less common or late features'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'hCG'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of hydatidiform mole (HM) is difficult to establish with certainty because of the low frequency of the disease and regional variation in reported rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>The reported incidence of HM varies widely in different regions of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. North American and European countries report low or intermediate rates of HM (66 to 121 per 100,000 pregnancies), whereas Latin American, Asian, and Middle Eastern nations report a wide range, including high rates (23 to 1299 per 100,000 pregnancies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This geographic difference in incidence, however, is based upon older studies, and subsequent data suggest that the incidence in Southeast Asia is much lower, and in fact may be similar to that seen in the Western Hemisphere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. This apparent demographic change likely reflects more accurate reporting of population-based rather than hospital-based data, improvement in diagnosis, as well as significant increases in living standards and health care in developing countries. However, studies continue to report an increased incidence among American Indians, Inuits, Hispanics, and African Americans, and investigations have not been able to attribute this finding to genetic traits, cultural factors, or simply differences in reporting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25</a>]. Data from the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center (NETDC) indicate that after adjustment for age and compared to whites, complete mole was significantly more common in Asians and significantly less common in Hispanics, but only marginally less common in blacks. Partial mole as compared to whites was significantly less common in Asians, Hispanics, and blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Data regarding the relative incidence of complete hydatidiform mole versus partial hydatidiform mole are also problematic because of the discrepancies between hospital-based and population-based data, and disparity in availability of expert pathology evaluation. In the United Kingdom, the incidence of complete mole is around 1 per 1000 pregnancies, and the incidence of partial mole is 3 per 1000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A similar ratio has been reported from data from Ireland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515626068\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main risk factors for hydatidiform mole (HM) are extremes of maternal age and a history of previous mole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,28</a>]:<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior molar pregnancy &ndash; Prior HM predisposes to another molar pregnancy. The risk for repeat molar pregnancy after the first mole is about 1 to 1.5 percent (approximately 10 to 15 times the risk for the general population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29,30</a>]. The recurrence rate after two molar pregnancies has been reported to range from 11 to 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In recurrent mole, one type of molar pregnancy can be followed by the same or a different type in any combination (eg, complete mole after complete mole, complete mole after partial mole).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremes of maternal age &ndash; The risk of complete mole is highest at extremes of maternal age (&le;15 and &gt;35 years). As an example, a series from the Charing Cross Hospital in London, including 7916 molar pregnancies, reported that the median maternal age was 27 years, and the highest risk of molar pregnancy was &le;15 and &ge;45 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A case-control study found that the risk for complete mole was increased twofold for women &gt;35 years and 7.5-fold for women &gt;40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32</a>]. These data suggest that ova from older women may be more susceptible to abnormal fertilizations that result in HM. In addition, women age 40 or older with HM may have a higher rate of severe complications. Most cases of HM, however, still occur in women under age 35 because of the greater number of pregnancies in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29,30</a>]. The risk for molar pregnancy and its relation to maternal age is much greater in complete mole than partial mole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33</a>].</p><p/><p>The risk for both complete mole and partial mole is increased in women with a history of prior spontaneous abortion and infertility. Compared with women with no previous history of miscarriage, the risk for complete mole and partial mole was 3.1 and 1.9, respectively, among women with two or more prior miscarriages. Difficulty in conception or infertility problems was associated with an odds risk of 2.4 and 3.2, respectively, of complete mole and partial mole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>Dietary factors may also play a role in and may partly explain the regional variations in the incidence of complete mole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,37</a>]. Case-control studies have observed that the risk for complete mole progressively increased with decreasing levels of consumption of dietary carotene (vitamin A precursor) and animal fat. Global regions with a high incidence of vitamin A deficiency correspond to areas with a high frequency of complete molar pregnancy. However, partial mole has not been related to dietary factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with hydatidiform mole (HM) typically present to their obstetric clinician with missed menstrual periods, a positive pregnancy test, and signs and symptoms consistent with early pregnancy or early pregnancy complications (bleeding, pelvic discomfort, hyperemesis gravidarum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,38-40</a>]. Molar pregnancy may be suspected based upon unusually high human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels or only after pathology evaluation of a failed pregnancy. </p><p>In many cases, particularly in partial mole, a patient is presumed to have a spontaneous abortion, and a molar pregnancy is detected only after pathology evaluation of a uterine curettage sample. As an example, in a series of 81 patients with partial mole, clinical diagnosis prior to uterine evacuation was incomplete or missed abortion in 74 patients (91 percent) and molar pregnancy in only five (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. If the products of conception are not examined histologically, the diagnosis of HM may be missed. In these patients, hCG monitoring to detect persistent disease is generally omitted and early diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is delayed.</p><p>Alternatively, women with early disease may be diagnosed before they develop symptoms, based upon an unusually high serum hCG or ultrasound findings (40 percent of patients with complete mole in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>The clinical presentation of complete hydatidiform mole began to change substantially in the 1980s. Prior to this time, complete mole typically presented with late effects (hyperthyroidism, preeclampsia). The availability of both ultrasonography and sensitive quantitative measurement of serum hCG has led to earlier diagnosis of complete mole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>]. Globally, complete mole is now diagnosed more frequently in the first rather than the second trimester. Thus, there are fewer late onset symptoms. However, there has been no change in risk for post-molar tumor. As an example, in one study, the average age at diagnosis was 11.8 weeks of gestation from 1988 to 1993, compared with 16.5 weeks from 1965 to 1975 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Despite the earlier diagnosis, the incidence of post-molar GTN did not change in the later cohort; 15 of 64 (23 percent) patients with complete mole who did not receive chemoprophylaxis developed post-molar persistent tumor. Even when complete mole is diagnosed before 10 weeks gestation, there is no decrease in the risk of GTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2161399174\"><span class=\"h2\">Common features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, an enlarged uterus, and hyperemesis gravidarum are common presenting symptoms. However, these are also common in early pregnancy, and thus, clinicians most often initially suspect a common pregnancy complication or an abnormal nonmolar pregnancy (spontaneous abortion or ectopic pregnancy) rather than HM. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2161399152\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginal bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal bleeding, which results from separation of the molar villi from the underlying decidua, is common (occurring in 84 percent of patients in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]). </p><p>In complete mole, the classic appearance of the blood is characterized as a &quot;prune juice&quot; discharge. This appearance is due to accumulated blood in the uterine cavity, which has undergone oxidation and liquefaction. </p><p>Historically, when complete mole typically presented at later gestational ages, vaginal bleeding was often heavy and prolonged and resulted in anemia. Anemia is now uncommon. At early gestational ages, the timing, volume, or pattern of bleeding in HM does not differ from other pregnancy-associated etiologies (spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy). Based on data from 1994 to 2013, vaginal bleeding occurs in only 46 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of bleeding in pregnancy is discussed in detail separately.

In current practice, this finding was present in only 21 of 74 (28 percent) patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Uterine enlargement is a nonspecific finding and may also be present for other reasons (eg, incorrect estimate of gestational age, multiple gestation, uterine leiomyomas).</p><p>Uterine enlargement is more likely with a complete mole than partial mole. Although in complete mole there is no fetus, the enlargement is due to both large volumes of molar tissue and retained blood and is usually associated with hCG levels &gt;100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span>. In fact, women with a partial mole may have a uterine size that is small for gestational age, due to slow growth of a fetus with triploidy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2161399350\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperemesis gravidarum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperemesis gravidarum was present in approximately 8 percent of patients in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Nausea and vomiting may develop earlier than in a nonmolar pregnancy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> be more severe. However, early or severe symptoms may also occur in a normal pregnancy, particularly in multiple gestation.

These are less common and some develop only later in the course if the molar pregnancy presents in the second trimester.</p><p>In complete mole, sequelae associated with the high hCG levels include theca lutein cysts, hyperthyroidism, and early onset of preeclampsia. For complete mole diagnosed in the first trimester, the risk of complications such as preeclampsia or significant hyperthyroidism is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,39,43,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39,43,48</a>].

A multiple conception with a normal co-twin with a complete or partial mole is a rare occurrence, developing in only 1 per 20,000 to 100,000 pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. It is possible that the incidence will increase with increased use of ovulation induction in older women and an increased rate of multiple gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Multiple gestations that include HM can usually be detected by pelvic ultrasound, but amniocentesis and chromosome analysis is occasionally required.

Between 1998 and 2011, 90 patients with complete mole and normal co-existing twin were managed. Among 51 patients deciding to continue pregnancy, 29 (57 percent) delivered a live baby at a median age of 34 weeks. GTN developed in 24 of 90 (26.7 percent) pregnancies, and there were no maternal deaths. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report from our center, the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center (NETDC), reviewed our experience with eight cases of complete mole with a co-existing twin and reviewed 14 additional cases published by other investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Additionally, we described one case of partial mole coexisting with a normal placenta and fetus. In this series and literature review, compared with singleton complete mole, pregnancies consisting of complete mole and co-existing fetus tended to be diagnosed later, have more markedly enlarged uteri, and have higher pre-evacuation human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels. Persistent tumor developed in 12 (55 percent) of 22 patients. Five (23 percent) fetuses survived, and no fetal anomalies were noted. The NETDC experience was compared and combined with Brazilian centers with a total of 72 patients with twin pregnancy with complete mole and coexisting normal fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Among 62 patients who chose to continue pregnancy, 36 (58 percent) delivered a live baby.

Genetic studies in such families showed that the related genes are at chromosome 19q13.3-13.4, and subsequent analysis noted NLRP7 mutations in this region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. The function of the normal protein and the mechanism by which mutations are associated with imprinting abnormalities and GTD are unknown. Data showing clustering of mutations in the leucine-rich region of NLRP7 suggest that this region is crucial for normal function. Some androgenetic diploid complete moles and possibly even triploid partial mole might also carry NLRP7 mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydatidiform mole (HM) is part of a group of diseases classified as gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD), which result from an aberrant fertilization and have the potential to locally invade the uterus and metastasize. Malignant GTD is referred to as gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) and includes invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor, and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HM can be categorized as complete mole or partial mole. Complete moles are diploid and partial moles are triploid. Complete moles typically produce higher levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The risk of GTN is higher for complete mole (15 to 20 percent) than partial mole (1 to 5 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97543 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2161400010\" class=\"local\">'Classification and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two main risk factors for GTD are extremes of maternal age (over age 35 or under 20) and previous GTD. (See <a href=\"#H2515626068\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HM presents with an elevated serum hCG concentration and is often accompanied by vaginal bleeding, an enlarged uterus, and pelvic discomfort. Since nonmolar pregnancy is by far the most common source of hCG, clinicians generally initially suspect a pregnancy complication (threatened or missed abortion, ectopic pregnancy) rather than HM. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial evaluation consists of a quantitative serum hCG and pelvic ultrasound examination. Serum hCG is often much higher in patients with GTD than in those with intrauterine or ectopic pregnancies. hCG is &gt;100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> in approximately 40 percent of complete moles and 6 percent of partial moles. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'hCG'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic ultrasound appearance of a complete mole is a central heterogeneous mass with numerous discrete anechoic spaces (referred to as a &quot;snowstorm or swiss cheese pattern&quot;). The ultrasound is more likely to be indeterminate in a partial mole, but abnormalities of the gestational sac or a placenta with cystic spaces may be seen. In partial mole, a fetus is present. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HM is a histologic diagnosis, based upon a uterine evacuation specimen. Complete and partial mole are differentiated based upon histopathology, karyotype (complete moles are diploid; partial are triploid), and whether a fetus is present (fetus is only present in partial mole). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89733806\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors and editors would like to recognize Drs.
