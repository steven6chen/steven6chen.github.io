As immunosuppressive agents and graft survival have improved, infection and malignancy have become the main barriers to disease-free survival after organ transplantation. As a result of the growing population of immunosuppressed patients with prolonged survival, an increased incidence and spectrum of opportunistic infections is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of infection in transplant recipients have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The risks of infection and an overview of specific infections in the solid organ transplant recipient will be reviewed here. The pretransplant evaluation for solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, prophylaxis of infections in solid organ transplant and HCT recipients, and an overview of infections following HCT are discussed separately.

Pulmonary processes can progress rapidly and may constitute medical emergencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These include infections due to <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (formerly <em>P. carinii</em>), <em>Nocardia asteroides</em>, <em>Aspergillus </em>spp, <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>, cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and <em>Legionella </em>spp.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory responses associated with microbial invasion are impaired by immunosuppressive therapy, which results in diminished symptoms and muted clinical and radiologic findings. Fever is neither a sensitive nor a specific predictor of infection; up to 40 percent of infections cause no fever (especially with fungal infections) and up to 22 percent of fevers are noninfectious in origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Infections are often advanced (ie, disseminated) at the time of clinical presentation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic testing is not generally useful for the diagnosis of acute infection in the immunocompromised host since seroconversion is often delayed. Serologic assays may be used to identify latent infections and distant exposures as a basis for prophylaxis. Microbiologic cultures are supplemented by antigen-based tests (eg, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays [ELISAs]) or nucleic acid-based molecular assays (eg, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) for diagnosis in this population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered anatomy following transplant surgery may change the physical signs of infection. Diagnosis often requires anatomic data from imaging such as computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue biopsies with histopathology and microbiology are often needed to make a specific microbiologic diagnosis in transplant recipients. Such clinical samples must be obtained early in the clinical course to enhance the chance for successful therapy, to minimize side effects of therapy, and before the patient's illness progresses to a point where such procedures can no longer be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of antimicrobial regimens is often more complex than in other patients due to the urgency of therapy and the frequency of drug toxicities and drug interactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial resistance is increased in immunocompromised hosts and should be considered in the choice of antimicrobial regimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical intervention is often necessary to cure localized infections (ie, debridement); antimicrobial agents alone are frequently inadequate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug levels provide only crude means of monitoring immunosuppressive regimens and patients are often more or less immunosuppressed than anticipated. Side effects of these regimens are also common.</p><p/><p>For all of these reasons, the central focus must be on disease prevention, including drug therapy and vaccination. This requires stratification of the risk for various infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylaxis of infections in solid organ transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-for-infection-before-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation for infection before solid organ transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bacteremia is more common in solid organ transplant recipients than in other hosts and usually occurs in association with urinary tract or other focal infections. In a case-control study, the mortality rate due to bacteremic sepsis appeared to be lower in solid organ transplant recipients compared with non-transplant patients at 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.22, 95% CI 0.09-0.54) and at 90 days (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.89) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a retrospective cohort study of patients with sepsis, solid organ transplant recipients had a lower rate of mortality than nontransplant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The association was seen in all types of transplant recipients except lung transplant recipients, who had a higher rate of mortality, and heart transplant recipients, in whom there was no difference. It is postulated that the lower rate of mortality in solid organ transplant recipients may be due to the fact that the immunosuppression associated with transplantation may blunt the inflammatory response to infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> that these patients may receive more aggressive management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF INFECTION FOLLOWING TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of infection in the organ transplant patient is determined by the synergy between two factors: the epidemiologic exposures of the individual and the &quot;net state of immunosuppression,&quot; which is a conceptual measure of all of the factors that contribute to the individual's susceptibility (or resistance) to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/1,4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiologic exposures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To adequately assess epidemiologic exposures, the clinician must take a detailed history of potential encounters with a variety of pathogens, even if the exposure was relatively remote. Latent pathogens are often activated in the setting of immune suppression. The epidemiologic exposures of importance to an individual will vary based upon the nature of the immune deficits. Most transplant patients have multiple deficits. Thus, bacterial and fungal pathogens are more important in the setting of neutropenia, while viral (eg, cytomegalovirus [CMV]) and intracellular (eg, tuberculosis [TB]) infections are more common with T cell immune deficits. <em>Strongyloides stercoralis</em> may reactivate many years following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-for-infection-before-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation for infection before solid organ transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Community-acquired pathogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transplant recipient can have contact with a number of potential pathogens within the community. These organisms include common respiratory viruses (influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial [RSV] virus, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus) and bacterial, viral, and parasitic gastrointestinal pathogens that may produce more persistent infections in these hosts (eg, with norovirus). Common bacterial pathogens include <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Mycoplasma</em>, <em>Legionella</em>, <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>, and <em>Salmonella</em>. Vaccinations for pneumococcus and influenza virus are encouraged but may have reduced efficacy in immunocompromised individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the appropriate geographic regions, endemic fungi (<em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, <em>Coccidioides </em>spp, <em>Paracoccidioides</em> spp, <em>Blastomyces dermatitidis</em>, <em>Cryptococcus gattii</em>) and common environmental pathogens (eg, <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>, <em>Aspergillus </em>spp, <em>Cryptosporidia </em>spp) will be observed. Thus, while specific infectious exposures within the community will vary based upon such factors as geography and socioeconomic status, the general dictum that &quot;common things occur commonly&quot; applies to transplant recipients. The severity and duration of infection and the frequency of multiple simultaneous processes are features that differentiate the transplant recipient from the normal host.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Reactivation of infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactivated infection may be derived from the organ donor or the recipient. Common viral infections that frequently reactivate following transplantation include herpes simplex virus (HSV), CMV, varicella-zoster virus (VZV, shingles), hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV), papillomavirus, and BK polyomavirus. Some exposures may have occurred many years before transplantation including geographically restricted systemic mycoses (eg, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis), <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, <em>Strongyloides stercoralis</em>, <em>Leishmania </em>spp, or <em>Trypanosoma cruzi </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].</p><p>An important goal of the pretransplant evaluation is to identify such latent infections so as to develop a preventive strategy for each.

Some of these infections are latent, while others are the result of bad timing (unappreciated active infection in the donor at the time of transplantation). The efficiency of the transmission of infectious diseases is likely to be greatest in immunosuppressed transplant recipients. In immunosuppressed hosts, classic signs of infections (eg, leukocytosis, erythema) may be replaced by nonspecific signs (eg, altered mental status, elevation of blood liver function tests, wound dehiscence, unexplained hypotension). As an example, in immunosuppressed hosts, the transmission of bloodborne or organ-derived infection due to West Nile virus more often manifests as neurologic disease with poor clinical outcomes than in immunocompetent hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Clusters of infection associated with organ transplantation have also included <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, <em>Candida</em> and <em>Aspergillus </em>(and other fungal) species, herpes simplex virus, human herpes virus 8, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>], rabies virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>], <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> (causing Chagas disease), <em>Balamuthia mandrillaris </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>], <em>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</em> (causing microsporidiosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], HIV, and hepatitis C virus. </p><p>Organ donors are screened to avoid transmission of certain infections to transplant recipients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55861\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55861 \">table 2</a>). Nonetheless, transmission of infection from donor to recipient may still occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80504 \">table 3</a>). The data supporting transmission of the individual infections are discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews for each infection. Donor screening requirements for HIV, HCV, and HBV have been updated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Several types of infection merit special attention: bloodstream infection, inapparent infections that are accelerated by immunosuppression, and a number of specific infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Bloodstream infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some donors may have active infection at the time of procurement. Certain pathogens (eg, staphylococci, pneumococcus, <em>Candida</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>E. coli</em>) may &quot;stick&quot; to anastomotic sites (vascular, urinary, biliary, tracheal) and produce fever, bloodstream infections, or mycotic aneurysms. Proof of adequate therapy for such infections must be established prior to accepting organs for transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Inapparent infections accelerated by immunosuppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other donor-derived infections may be inapparent or unusual (eg, West Nile virus, leishmaniasis, rabies, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Chagas disease, HIV, herpes simplex virus) and may cause clinical syndromes that are accelerated by immune suppression.</p><p>As an example, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection (LCMV) occurred in the recipients of solid organ transplants from three different donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In the investigation of the first two clusters, LCMV was identified in tissues in all organ transplant recipients from both investigations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The isolates from each investigation were identical to each other but distinct between the two outbreaks. In contrast, the common donors had no clinical or laboratory evidence of infection, although the donor from the 2005 cluster had a history of exposure to a pet hamster. Seven of eight transplant recipients died; one survivor was treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> and decreasing doses of immunosuppressants. An epidemiologic investigation, using phylogenetic analysis of virus sequences, eventually traced the origin of these infections to an animal distribution center in Ohio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Three patients in Australia who received a kidney or liver from a single donor died of a febrile illness with associated encephalopathy four to six weeks after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. High-throughput RNA sequencing from the allografts of two of the patients revealed an arenavirus that is related to LCMV. These results were confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis of allograft tissue as well as IgM and IgG antiviral antibodies from the serum of the donor. In addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed the presence of the virus in the kidneys, liver, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid of the recipients. The donor had just returned home from a three-month visit to rural areas of the former Yugoslavia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">CMV and EBV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are associated with particular syndromes and morbidity in the immunocompromised population. The greatest risk for invasive infection is seen in recipients who are seronegative (immunologically naive) and receive infected grafts from seropositive donors (latent viral infection). This risk constitutes the rationale for anti-CMV prophylaxis in such patients.

Some are based in the production of intracellular ATP in response to mitogenic stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. These assays are more useful in measuring the risk of infection than rejection.

As an example, &quot;induction&quot; with polyclonal or monoclonal anti-T lymphocyte antisera may be used for renal transplantation from deceased donors but not in living related donor transplant recipients or in liver transplant recipients with hepatitis C infection. At some centers, patients may receive little or no glucocorticoid therapy but are treated with combinations of multiple other potent immunosuppressants. Alterations in the type or intensity of immune suppression will alter the risk of infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53524\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53524 \">table 4</a>) and the list of potential pathogens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80504 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>It is useful to divide the posttransplant course into three time periods related to the risks of infection by specific pathogens: the early period post transplant (first month), an intermediate period (one to six months), and more than six months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58770\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58770 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].

Transmission of donor-derived bacteria and fungi has increased with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance such that vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and fluconazole-resistant <em>Candida </em>species may be transmitted from donor to recipient. Graft-associated viral infections (LCMV, West Nile virus, rabies, HIV) and parasitic infections (toxoplasmosis, Chagas disease, <em>Balamuthia mandrillaris</em>) are uncommon but may be amplified in the immunosuppressed host. Endemic infections (eg, histoplasmosis or tuberculosis) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of posttransplant infection or unusual clinical syndromes (eg, encephalitis, hepatitis).

Transplant recipients are also at unique risk for superinfection of ischemic or injured graft tissues (eg, anastomotic suture lines) or of fluid collections (eg, hematomas, lymphoceles, pleural effusions, urinomas). These patients are at increased risk for infection associated with indwelling vascular access catheters, urinary catheters, and surgical drains. </p><p>The organisms responsible for such postoperative complications are often the bacteria and fungi that have colonized the recipient or donor (eg, the lungs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sinuses in cystic fibrosis) prior to transplantation or the local flora of the hospital. Infections acquired prior to transplantation may include relatively resistant nosocomial pathogens (eg, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus) and pathogens such as <em>Aspergillus</em> spp that are resistant to the usual prophylactic agents. Patients receiving antimicrobial agents are at increased risk for <em>C. difficile</em> colitis.</p><p>Patients at particular risk of nosocomial infection are those requiring prolonged ventilatory support or those with diminished lung function, persistent ascites, stents of the urinary tract or biliary ducts, with intravascular clot or ischemic graft tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/49,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,58</a>].

This is the period when patients are most at risk for the development of opportunistic infections, although residual problems from the perioperative period can persist. There is significant geographic and institutional variation in the occurrence of opportunistic infections during the first six months post transplantation. This reflects local epidemiology and varying immunosuppressive strategies and also the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis in the posttransplant period. Prevention of the infections observed during this period is the basis of prophylactic antimicrobial strategies. Prophylaxis delays but does not eliminate the risk for infections that may occur in the months following cessation of prophylaxis.

Thus, more sensitive imaging techniques such as computed tomographic (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential for assessing the presence and nature of infectious and malignant processes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosis is tissue histology. No radiologic finding is sufficiently diagnostic to obviate the need for tissue. Multiple simultaneous infections are also common. Thus, invasive procedures that provide tissue for culture and histology must be employed early as a routine component of the initial evaluation of transplant recipients with infectious syndromes. Patients failing to respond to appropriate therapy may also need invasive diagnostic procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic tests, which indicate past exposure to certain pathogens, are useful in the pretransplant setting to assess risk for relapse of latent disease but are not generally useful after transplantation. Patients, especially those receiving immunosuppressive therapies, do not reliably develop antibodies quickly enough during an active infection to enable a serologic diagnosis. Thus, quantitative tests that directly detect the protein products or nucleic acids of the organisms such as sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), direct immunofluorescence, or quantitative molecular assays (nucleic acid tests [NATs]) should be utilized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transplant recipients are often colonized and thus are particularly vulnerable to organisms resistant to antimicrobial agents either from the hospital environment or through induction of antibiotic resistance in their flora during therapy (eg, inducible beta-lactamases).

As an example, in a study of solid organ transplant recipients admitted with an infection, infectious disease consultation was associated with reduced 28-day mortality (hazard ratio 0.33) and 30-day rehospitalization rates (17 versus 24 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

The initiation of a diagnostic evaluation for infection frequently begins when clinical symptoms become manifest. That is often late in the course of the disease in these immunocompromised patients. Further, accurate microbiologic diagnoses are needed to avoid unnecessary toxicities associated with therapy. Thus, invasive diagnostic procedures are often required to make an accurate microbiologic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>].</p><p>More advanced, quantitative laboratory assays utilizing molecular techniques or antigen detection are integral components of transplant care. Such tests may be prohibitively costly for routine use in some areas. Rapid, quantitative, cost-effective assays that do not depend upon invasive procedures are needed for the routine monitoring of transplant patients for infections and for graft rejection. The availability of such tests would allow the clinician to individualize prophylactic antimicrobial regimens and minimize drug-associated toxicity.</p><p>The evolution of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi) with acquired resistance to common antimicrobial agents and the incidence of drug toxicity and allergy have limited the available antimicrobial strategies for transplant recipients.
