Consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is offered to a subset of patients with a particularly high risk of relapse. Others are observed after CR with plans to retreat if and when relapse occurs. Consolidation with radiation therapy is not routinely administered, but abbreviated chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation therapy is an option for patients who are unable to tolerate standard chemotherapy.</p><p>Support for this approach is largely extrapolated from retrospective analyses, small prospective studies that included other types of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL), and from subgroup analyses of patients with ALCL enrolled on such studies.

Patients with PTCL generally have a worse prognosis, stage for stage, than patients with aggressive B cell lymphomas. However, patients with ALCL typically have more favorable outcomes than other subtypes of PTCL. In particular, patients with ALK-positive ALCL often have a very favorable prognosis. Estimated five-year overall survival (OS) rates for patients with ALK-positive ALCL have ranged from 70 to 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>].

Neither of these groups showed improved OS. When all patients with ALCL were analyzed regardless of treatment, the three-year EFS and OS rates for patients with ALK-positive ALCL were 76 and 90 percent, compared with 46 and 62 percent for ALK-negative ALCL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Swedish Lymphoma Registry Study demonstrated an improvement in PFS but not OS with the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> in patients with PTCL under the age of 60 with a normal LDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Of 635 eligible patients, 98 had T cell lymphoma (22 were ALCL). In the study population as a whole, the five-year EFS and OS were both superior with ACBVP. However, treatment-related mortality was higher with ACVBP (13 versus 7 percent). ACBVP also resulted in higher rates of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, infection, and mucositis.</p><p/><p>We favor CHOEP over ACBVP given the toxicity of ACBVP, the small number and narrow age range of ALCL patients in the study, and lack of availability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vindesine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vindesine</a> in many countries (including the United States).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953620453\"><span class=\"h3\">Is there a role for radiation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with limited (stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II)</span> ALCL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>), we suggest six cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy rather than an abbreviated course of chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy (RT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F107277\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107277 \">algorithm 1</a>). If a patient with limited stage ALCL is unable to tolerate chemotherapy or has significant comorbidities, then three or four cycles of chemotherapy followed by RT is an acceptable alternative. There is no evidence that adding RT after six cycles of therapy is beneficial for patients who achieve a CR. We do offer RT to patients who achieve a partial response (PR) with six cycles of chemotherapy with a goal of achieving CR.</p><p>No large, randomized trial has definitively evaluated the efficacy of RT in conjunction with chemotherapy in early stage ALCL.

Thirty-two of these patients received local RT to a median dose of 40 Gy. Although there was a trend toward superior OS and PFS in patients who underwent RT, the difference was not statistically significant. On subset analysis, the 12 patients who responded to three or four cycles of CHOP or CHOEP and then underwent RT had identical outcomes when compared with early stage patients who received at least six cycles of the same chemotherapy. The small number of patients who received abbreviated chemotherapy plus RT limits the interpretation of this analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study analyzed the outcome of 46 adult patients with stage I or stage II systemic ALCL all but two of whom received CHOP or a CHOP-like regimen followed by RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The frequency and extent of these visits depends upon the comfort of both the patient and physician. When planning the post-treatment surveillance strategy, care should be taken to limit the number of computed tomography (CT) scans, particularly in younger individuals, given concerns about radiation exposure and the risk for second malignancies.

Starting at year 5, patients are seen once per year. At these visits we perform a history and physical examination, complete blood count, chemistries, and lactate dehydrogenase. We obtain a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every six months for the first 18 months after documentation of an initial complete response. We only obtain additional positron emission <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/computed</span> tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span> scans to further evaluate any concerning findings noted on CT scans. We do not obtain routine CT scans after 18 months unless there are signs, symptoms, or exam findings to suggest relapse.</p><p>Relapsed disease can be suggested by changes on imaging studies but can only be confirmed by biopsy.

Autologous HCT provides a benefit to patients with relapsed ALK-positive ALCL and, to a lesser extent, patients with relapsed ALK-negative ALCL. A subset of these patients will achieve long-term disease control. Therefore, if a patient is medically suitable for transplant, the intent of subsequent treatment should be to attain a complete remission (CR) in preparation for autologous HCT. </p><p>Autologous HCT has not been directly compared with other approaches in this setting. Some patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brentuximab-vedotin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brentuximab vedotin</a> (BV) alone have maintained long-term CR without subsequent therapy, but it is not yet clear if autologous HCT improves long-term survival in patients who have a CR after BV treatment.

If a patient has had a prior autologous HCT, then allogeneic HCT is the preferred transplant strategy.</p><p>Patients who are not candidates for transplant are treated with palliative intent, generally with sequential single agents or combination therapies with comparatively low toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3517247252\"><span class=\"h3\">Transplant-eligible patients</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372423161\"><span class=\"h4\">Following initial chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of chemotherapy agents and combination regimens have been used for patients with resistant or relapsed ALCL. Given the rarity of ALCL, randomized trials are not available to guide the selection of therapy. As such, a choice among regimens is largely based on side effect profiles and clinical experience.

Although data are scant, it is not clear if patients who achieve a CR with BV have a superior progression-free survival (PFS) when consolidated with transplant. The optimal number of cycles of BV prior to transplant is unclear. We generally treat for two to three cycles beyond CR in preparation for transplant.

Patients who achieve a CR with this regimen should be consolidated with an autologous HCT, while those with a PR should be considered for allogeneic HCT or additional salvage therapy.

Allogeneic HCT is associated with a significant risk of early morbidity and late complications but offers the opportunity for long-term remission.

The key to treatment of PC-ALCL is often to avoid overtreatment. Oncologists unfamiliar with the disease may recommend aggressive systemic chemotherapy including high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation when such steps are unnecessary and overly toxic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953620595\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast implant-associated ALCL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast implant-associated ALCL is a rare but increasingly well-described entity. The malignant cells are confined to the fluid within the capsule surrounding the implant can be managed with capsulectomy followed by observation. This approach is not appropriate if there is a mass lesion.

Our preferred chemotherapy regimen is largely dependent on patient age (see <a href=\"#H1207528109\" class=\"local\">'Anthracycline-based chemotherapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients under the age of 60, we suggest six cycles of CHOEP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, administered every three weeks) rather than CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or other regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients age 60 and older, we suggest six cycles of CHOP (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In this age group, the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> appears to increase toxicity without increasing efficacy. The risks and benefits of adding etoposide can be considered in especially fit patients in this age category but is not suggested routinely. If a patient with limited stage ALCL is unable to tolerate six cycles of CHOP, then three cycles of CHOP followed by radiation therapy (RT) is an acceptable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H953620453\" class=\"local\">'Is there a role for radiation?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no evidence that adding RT after six cycles of therapy is beneficial for patients who achieve a CR. We do offer RT to patients who achieve a partial response (PR) with six cycles of chemotherapy with a goal of achieving CR.

Others are observed after CR with plans to retreat if relapse occurs. The decision to proceed to HCT is dependent on the patient's age, International Prognostic Index (IPI), and ALK status (see <a href=\"#H953620459\" class=\"local\">'Autologous HCT in first remission'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients with ALK-positive ALCL who achieve CR after six cycles of CHOP or CHOEP, we suggest observation rather than HCT given their favorable outcome without HCT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In contrast, we suggest HCT for the subset of patients with ALK-positive ALCL in first CR who are &gt;40 years of age and have an IPI &ge;3 given their comparatively poor prognosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with ALK-negative ALCL generally have a worse prognosis than patients with ALK-positive disease. For most patients with ALK-negative ALCL, we suggest HCT in first CR rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The exception is patients with an IPI &lt;2 who achieve a CR after six cycles of CHOP or CHOEP. In general, we favor observation for most patients in this subgroup, particularly those over the age of 65 that may have increased toxicity with HCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with relapsed or refractory ALCL is largely based on whether the patient is a candidate for autologous or allogeneic HCT. If a patient is medically suitable for transplant, the intent of subsequent treatment should be to attain a CR in preparation for HCT. Patients who are not candidates for HCT are treated with palliative intent, generally with sequential single agents or combination therapies with comparatively low toxicity.
