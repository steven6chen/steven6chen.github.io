However, there remain situations in which implantation of an ICD is immediately not feasible (eg, patients with an active infection), may be of uncertain benefit, may not be covered by third-party payers (eg, early post-myocardial infarction, patients with limited life expectancy or new onset systolic heart failure), or when an ICD must be removed (eg, infection).</p><p>In cases where ICD implantation must be deferred, a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) offers an alternative approach for the prevention of SCD. The WCD (LifeVest) is an external device capable of automatic detection and defibrillation of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60103\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60103 \">picture 1</a>). While the WCD can be worn for years, typically the device is used for several months as temporary protection against SCD.</p><p>The indications, efficacy, and limitations of the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator will be discussed here. Detailed discussions of the roles of the ICD are presented separately.

As of October 2017, the approved devices do not have pacing capabilities and therefore are unable to provide therapy for bradycardic events or antitachycardic pacing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1225629183\"><span class=\"h2\">Wearing the WCD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WCD is composed of four dry, nonadhesive monitoring electrodes, three defibrillation electrodes incorporated into a chest strap assembly, and a defibrillation unit carried on a waist belt (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60103\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60103 \">picture 1</a>). The monitoring electrodes are positioned circumferentially around the chest, held in place by tension from an elastic belt, and provide two surface electrocardiogram (ECG) leads. The defibrillation electrodes are positioned in a vest assembly for apex-posterior defibrillation. Proper fitting is required to achieve adequate skin contact to avoid noise and frequent alarms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1225629216\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection and delivery of shocks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arrhythmia detection by the WCD is programmed using ECG rate and morphology criteria. The system is programmed to define ventricular arrhythmias when the ventricular heart rate exceeds a preprogrammed rate threshold with an ECG morphology that does not match a baseline electrocardiographic template.</p><p>Typical programming is reflected in default device settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VT detection 150 to 199 beats per minute</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VF detection &ge;200 beats per minute</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with 150 J shocks for up to five shocks </p><p/><p>The tachycardia detection rate is programmable for VF between 120 and 250 beats per minute, and the VF shock delay can be programmed from 25 to 55 seconds. The VT detection rate is programmable between 120 bpm to the VF setting with a VT shock delay of 60 to 180 seconds. VT signals can allow synchronized shock delivery on the R wave, but if the R wave cannot be identified, unsynchronized shocks will be delivered. </p><p>If an arrhythmia is detected, an escalating alarm sequence occurs, including a vibration against the skin and audible tones. Although shocks may be transmitted to bystanders in physical contact with the patient being shocked by a WCD, a voice cautions the patient and bystanders to the impending shock. Patients are trained to hold a pair of response buttons during these alarms to avoid receiving a shock while awake. A patient's response serves as a test of consciousness; if no response occurs and a shock is indicated, the device charges, extrudes gel from the defibrillation electrodes, and delivers up to five biphasic shocks at preprogrammed energy levels (ranging from 75 to 150 joules). The device does include a default sleep time from 11 PM to 6 AM, programmable in one-hour increments, which allows additional time for deep sleepers, if they awaken, to abort shocks. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1225630641\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy in terminating VT/VF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shock efficacy with the WCD appears to be similar to that reported with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). However, sudden cardiac death may still occur in those not wearing the device, those with improper positioning of the device, due to bystander interference, due to the inability of the WCD to detect the ECG signal, or due to bradyarrhythmias. These results highlight the importance of patient education and promotion of compliance while using the WCD. </p><p>The efficacy of the WCD has been tested for induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias as well as for spontaneous events during clinical trials and postmarket study. When worn properly, the WCD appears to be as effective as an ICD for the termination of VT and VF, with successful shocks occurring in up to 100 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of induced <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> in the electrophysiology laboratory, the WCD successfully detected and terminated <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> with 100 percent first-shock success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the <span class=\"nowrap\">WEARIT/BIROAD</span> studies, six of eight defibrillations successfully terminated <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The two unsuccessful defibrillations occurred in patients with incorrectly placed therapy electrodes (eg, defibrillating pads reversed and not directed to the skin) with one sudden death in a patient with reversed leads.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subsequent US postmarket study of 8453 patients who wore a WCD after myocardial infarction, 146 <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> events occurred in 133 patients, and the overall shock success rate for terminating <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> was 82 percent, with 91 percent immediate survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In this study, shock success resulting in survival was 95 percent in revascularized and 84 percent in non-revascularized patients, suggesting that lower efficacy rates may be related to ischemic events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the WEARIT-II registry of 2000 patients who wore a WCD for a median of 90 days, 120 episodes of sustained <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> were seen in 41 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For 90 of the episodes, patients pressed the response buttons to abort shock delivery, with the majority of sustained VT episodes terminating spontaneously following use of the response button. All of the remaining 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> episodes in 22 different patients were successfully terminated with a single shock.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 6043 German patients who wore the device between April 2010 and October 2013, 94 patients were shocked for sustained <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF,</span> with the WCD successfully terminating <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> in 88 patients (94 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The WCD appears equally efficacious among patients with and without myocardial ischemia immediately prior to <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> detection and shock (as defined by &ge;0.1 mV ST-segment changes on ECG), with first shock termination rates of 96 percent in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1225630813\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoiding inappropriate shocks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When electronic noise occurs, which may potentially be interpreted at VT or VF, the WCD emits a noise alarm. This electronic noise can often be minimized or eliminated by changing body position or tightening of the electrode belt, and shocks can be avoided by pushing the response buttons. While a dual-chamber ICD with an atrial lead would seemingly have greater ability to discriminate between supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and VT, the incidence of inappropriate shocks due to atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia, or other supraventricular arrhythmias in clinical studies of WCDs has been low. The WCD uses a two-channel proprietary vectorcardiogram morphology matching algorithm to prevent shocks during SVT if the QRS is unchanged, and inappropriate shocks can also be averted when the patient presses the response buttons. (See <a href=\"#H1225630988\" class=\"local\">'Inappropriate shocks'</a> below.)</p><p>In a small study of the 60 patients with a permanent pacemaker, in which a variety of pacing modes (AAI, VVI, DDD) and configurations (unipolar, bipolar) were tested, unipolar DDD pacing triggered <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> detection in six patients (10 percent), while no other pacing modes or configurations triggered arrhythmia detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As such, patients whose pacemaker is programmed to unipolar DDD pacing should be evaluated for pacemaker reprogramming to a bipolar mode prior to WCD usage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6129238\"><span class=\"h2\">Storage of ECGs and compliance data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to delivering therapeutic shocks for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, the WCD stores data regarding arrhythmias, patient compliance with the device, and noise or interference with its proper functioning. Arrhythmia recordings from the WCD are available for clinician review once stored data are transmitted via a modem to the manufacturer's network. Treatments, patient compliance, ECG records, and system performance can be viewed using a secure website.</p><p>The WCD stores ECGs from both tachyarrhythmias and asystole:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The system is programmed to define ventricular arrhythmias when the ventricular heart rate exceeds a preprogrammed rate threshold with an ECG morphology that does not match a baseline electrocardiographic template. The monitoring software captures 30 seconds of ECG signal prior to the determination of VT or VF and continuously records until 15 seconds after the alarms stop. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asystole recordings are also triggered when ventricular heart rates drop below 10 beats per minute or 16 seconds of asystole, and the device automatically records the event with 120 seconds preceding the onset. If using the secure website in conjunction with the WCD, alerts can be configured to prompt the health care provider that a patient is experiencing bradycardia or an asystole. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients can perform manual recordings by pressing response buttons for three seconds, which records the prior 30 seconds plus the next 15 seconds. </p><p/><p>The WCD also records information about patient compliance, ECG signal quality, alarm history, and noise occurrence. <span class=\"nowrap\">Time/date</span> stamps for device <span class=\"nowrap\">on/off</span> switching, monitor connection to the electrodes, and electrode-to-skin contact are recorded. Compliance may be determined by assessing time that the user had the device turned on, the belt connected, and at least one monitoring electrode contacting the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6129259\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WCD is indicated as temporary therapy for patients with a high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/1,11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11-15</a>].

Reevaluation of LVEF should occur one to three months after the MI.

Despite a reduction in arrhythmic deaths among patients with an ICD, there was a higher risk of nonarrhythmic deaths during this early period, resulting in similar overall mortality rates. </p><p/><p>Professional society guidelines do not recommend ICD implantation for primary prevention of SCD within 40 days of acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

As an example, in the United States the national coverage decision for the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Service (CMS) excludes coverage for primary prevention ICDs if patients have had CABG surgery or PCI within the past three months. This is based upon the clinical profile of subjects included in the major ICD trials for primary prevention of SCD in ischemic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/11,12,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,23,24</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H6129238\" class=\"local\">'Storage of ECGs and compliance data'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The WCD is indicated as temporary therapy for patients with a high risk for SCD:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &le;35 percent less than 40 days post-myocardial infarction (MI), we suggest considering the use of a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention against SCD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Reevaluation of LVEF should occur one to three months after the MI. If LVEF remains &le;35 percent on follow-up assessment, despite appropriate medical therapy, ICD implantation is indicated and should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H6129266\" class=\"local\">'Early post-MI patients with LV dysfunction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with LVEF &le;35 percent who have undergone coronary revascularization with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in the past three months, we suggest the use of a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention against SCD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). LVEF should be reassessed three months following CABG. If a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia has occurred, or if the LVEF remains &le;35 percent three months after CABG, implantation of an ICD is usually indicated. (See <a href=\"#H6129289\" class=\"local\">'Patients with LV dysfunction early after coronary revascularization'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In selected patients with severe but potentially reversible cardiomyopathy, such as tachycardia- or myocarditis-associated cardiomyopathy, the WCD may be useful for the prevention of SCD due to ventricular arrhythmias while awaiting improvement in LV function, ICD implantation, or if needed, cardiac transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H6129304\" class=\"local\">'Newly diagnosed nonischemic cardiomyopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with severe heart failure awaiting heart transplantation represent a group at particularly high risk for SCD in whom ICD implantation is often recommended. The WCD may be a reasonable noninvasive alternative approach, particularly for patients whose anticipated waiting time to transplant is short if an ICD is not already present. (See <a href=\"#H6129319\" class=\"local\">'Bridge to heart transplant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some patients with an indication for an ICD may require a delay in ICD implantation due to comorbid conditions (ie, infection, recovery from surgery, lack of vascular access). Additionally, some patients who have an ICD need it removed due to infection. In such patients, the WCD may provide protection against ventricular tachyarrhythmias until an ICD can be implanted or reimplanted. (See <a href=\"#H1225630269\" class=\"local\">'Bridge to indicated or interrupted ICD therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When worn properly, the WCD appears to be as effective as an ICD for the termination of VT and VF, with successful shocks occurring in nearly 100 percent of cases. In addition, inappropriate shock rates from the WCD appear to be comparable to and in some studies lower than those reported for ICDs. (See <a href=\"#H1225630641\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy in terminating VT/VF'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1225630988\" class=\"local\">'Inappropriate shocks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limitations of the WCD (compared with a traditional ICD) include the lack of pacemaker functionality, the requirement for patient interaction and compliance, and potential discomfort due to the size and weight of the device. (See <a href=\"#H6129406\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of the WCD'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sharma PS, Bordachar P, Ellenbogen KA.
