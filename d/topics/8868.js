Issues related to infectious tenosynovitis will be reviewed here. Noninfectious causes of tenosynovitis can mimic clinical features of infectious tenosynovitis; these disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=de-quervain-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;de Quervain tendinopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigger finger (stenosing flexor tenosynovitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomic placement of tendons, their sheaths, and the adjacent bursae has important implications for the clinical features of tenosynovitis (inflammation of a tendon sheath) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77271 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-and-thumb-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Finger and thumb anatomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Extensor and flexor tendon sheaths have two surfaces: an inner visceral layer adherent to the tendon and an outer parietal layer abutting adjacent structures such as bursae and muscles. In their normal states, the visceral and parietal layers abut one another; in the setting of tenosynovitis, the space between the two layers may fill with inflammatory or purulent fluid.</p><p>The visceral and parietal layers of most tendons are tightly joined at the ends to produce a closed compartment encased in a tendon sheath. Many tendon sheaths lie in close proximity to adjacent bursae. Therefore, infection in a tendon sheath can spread readily to adjacent bursae as well as other tendon sheaths. For example [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious tenosynovitis involving the extensor tendons on the dorsum of the hand can spread via bursae to the volar surface of the hand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious tenosynovitis involving the tendon sheaths of the wrist can spread to adjacent bursae and tendon sheaths surrounding the ulna and radius.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections of the flexor tendons of the small fingers can spread into the carpel tunnel, producing symptoms similar to those seen in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> can spread into the flexor tendons of the thumb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>Spread of infection from tendon sheaths to surrounding soft tissue can also result in compartment syndrome and tissue necrosis.</p><p>The ends of flexor tendons are overlaid by retinacular structures that act as pulleys to facilitate movement (particularly in the hands, feet, ankle, and wrist) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In contrast, most extensor tendons lack retinacular structures, so infections of extensor tendons rarely result in loculated or well-localized infections. Thus, extensor tenosynovitis may be difficult to distinguish from a simple soft tissue infection. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tendon sheath infections develop via one of three mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma with direct inoculation (eg, laceration, puncture, or bite)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contiguous spread from infected adjacent soft tissues</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematogenous spread</p><p/><p>Infectious tenosynovitis may present as an acute or subacute infection. The mechanism of infection and the causative pathogen dictate the nature of the clinical presentation. Most infectious tenosynovitis presents as acute infection via trauma with direct inoculation, although any of the above mechanisms may present acutely. Subacute presentations (eg, those with a delay between exposure and the appearance of clinical findings) can occur in the setting of infection due to mycobacteria and fungi such as <em>Sporothrix</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of sporotrichosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tendon sheath infections may be monomicrobial or polymicrobial. The microbiology of tendon sheath infections is closely linked to the underlying mechanism of infection, as discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma and contiguous spread</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost any organism can cause a tendon sheath infection. The most common pathogens implicated in pyogenic tenosynovitis due to trauma are skin flora (eg, gram-positive cocci such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and streptococci) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Lacerations and bites are commonly associated with polymicrobial infection including gram-negative organisms. Tenosynovitis in the setting of diabetes is likelier to be polymicrobial and include gram-negative bacilli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Types of trauma with specific associated pathogens include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cat and dog bites &ndash; Cat and dog bites are relatively common causes of infectious tenosynovitis. These infections are frequently polymicrobial. <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>Pasteurella multocida</em> are important pathogens, either alone or together.

Such infections are caused by skin or mouth flora, including <em>Eikenella</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In addition, unusual pathogens such as <em>Cryptococcus </em>and <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em> are important considerations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of infectious tenosynovitis involve the upper extremities but, occasionally, cases occur in the lower extremity as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The cardinal signs of infectious flexor tenosynovitis are commonly called Kanavel signs (first described in 1912) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenderness along the course of the flexor sheath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symmetric or fusiform enlargement of the affected digit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slightly flexed finger at rest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain along the tendon with passive extension</p><p/><p>In a study of 75 patients with infectious flexor tenosynovitis of the upper extremity, pain with passive extension was the earliest finding; tenderness along the tendon sheath was a late sign of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In another case series involving 16 patients with flexor tenosynovitis of the hand, fusiform swelling and pain with passive extension were the most common findings (100 percent and 75 percent, respectively); pain on passive extension was present in about half of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Severe pain and tenderness following a bite or puncture wound should suggest the presence of tenosynovitis regardless of whether it is associated with all, some, or none of the above findings. However, a diagnosis of tenosynovitis should not be discarded because a history of trauma is lacking; rarely, small puncture injuries can be overlooked because they are minor or because they did not occur in temporal proximity to the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Fever may or may not be present; among 75 patients with infectious flexor tenosynovitis, only 17 percent had fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Other findings may include subcutaneous purulence (due to rupture of tendon sheath) and cutaneous signs of ischemia including skin necrosis. These findings have important prognostic implications. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Infections involving flexor tendons progress in the following stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 1 &ndash; Distention of the inflamed tendon sheath with exudative fluid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2 &ndash; Distention of the inflamed tendon sheath with purulent fluid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3 &ndash; Septic necrosis and destruction of the tendon sheath and surrounding retinacular structures</p><p/><p>The stage of infection is important for determining the approach to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Infections involving extensor tendon sheaths are unusual. Since extensor tendons typically lack retinacular structures, patients with infections involving these structures often lack the typical findings seen in infections of flexor tendons. Thus, delays in diagnosis or misdiagnosis as an uncomplicated soft tissue infection may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

If there is associated cutaneous purulence at the site of tenosynovitis, specimens should be sent for Gram stain and culture. However, in most cases, aspiration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biopsy are required for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Specimens should be submitted for histopathological exam and culture (including bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungal organisms). Histopathologic evidence of granulomas should prompt histologic stains for mycobacteria and fungal organisms.</p><p>Plain radiographs are usually normal in patients with infectious tenosynovitis, but such studies are useful to rule out bony involvement or the presence of a foreign body, particularly if there is a history of trauma or a bite. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging may also be useful to confirm the presence of tendon sheath abnormalities and for preoperative evaluation to localize the extent of infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Clinical applications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-nomenclature-technical-considerations-validation-and-standardization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Nomenclature, technical considerations, validation, and standardization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Blood cultures should be obtained for patients with known or suspected pyogenic tenosynovitis and systemic symptoms or signs such as fever, chills, or hypotension. A <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> or an interferon-gamma release assay should be performed in patients with suspected tenosynovitis due to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109508094\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of conditions can mimic infectious tenosynovitis. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gout &ndash; Gout can mimic infectious tenosynovitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Clinical manifestations include erythema, warmth, swelling, and pain at the site of an involved joint. The diagnosis is established by visualization of uric acid crystals in the joint fluid.

Clinical manifestations include pain accompanied by presence of erythematous papules, which evolve into vesicles. The diagnosis is usually established clinically but can be confirmed by viral culture, immunofluorescence, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-herpes-zoster\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psoriatic arthritis &ndash; Psoriatic arthritis may present as a symmetrical polyarthritis, an asymmetric oligoarthritis, arthritis of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, as a destructive arthritis, or as a spondyloarthritis. The diagnosis can generally be made in a patient who has both psoriasis and an inflammatory arthritis in a typical pattern.

Typically, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the fingers and the interphalangeal joints of the thumbs are involved. The diagnosis can be made in the setting of arthritis involving three or more joints, positive rheumatoid factor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-citrullinated <span class=\"nowrap\">peptide/protein</span> antibody, and elevated inflammatory markers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudogout &ndash; Pseudogout is characterized by self-limited acute or subacute attacks of arthritis involving one or several extremity joints (monoarthritis and pauci[oligo]-arthritis, respectively). The diagnosis is established by visualization of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joint fluid.

It most often occurs due to repetitive use that involves pinching with the thumb while moving the wrist in radial and ulnar directions.

Stage 1 infection should be managed with tendon sheath irrigation and drainage, with or without debridement. Stage 2 or 3 infection should be managed with surgical debridement of the tendon sheaths and surrounding necrotic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Amputation may be necessary in severe cases. Drainage of tendon sheaths can be accomplished via open washout or catheter irrigation, depending on the degree of necrosis and the stage of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Surgical intervention is also appropriate in the setting of associated bursal or bony involvement and is mandatory if a compartment syndrome is present.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

The anatomic placement of tendons, their sheaths, and the adjacent bursae has important implications for the clinical features of tenosynovitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77271 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenosynovitis develops via trauma with direct inoculation (eg, laceration, puncture, or bite), contiguous spread from infected adjacent soft tissues, or hematogenous spread. The most common pathogens in the setting of trauma (with or without contiguous spread) are skin flora (eg, gram-positive cocci such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and streptococci). Pathogens associated with hematogenous spread include <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and mycobacteria. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of tenosynovitis range from pain with passive extension to tenderness along the tendon sheath. Fever may or may not be present. Findings of advanced infection may include subcutaneous purulence (due to rupture of tendon sheath), tissue necrosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> compartment syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of tenosynovitis is confirmed by microbiological and histopathological evaluation. In most cases, aspiration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biopsy is required for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Specimens should be submitted for histopathological exam and culture (including bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungal organisms). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of tenosynovitis includes surgical intervention and antibiotic therapy. In general, early infection should be managed with tendon sheath irrigation and drainage, with or without debridement. Advanced infection should be managed with debridement of the tendon sheaths and surrounding necrotic tissue. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microbiologic data and mechanism of infection should guide selection of effective antibiotic therapy. Pending definitive diagnosis, tenosynovitis associated with trauma may be treated empirically with antibiotic therapy active against gram-positive and-gram negative organisms. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-tenosynovitis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Tsai E, Failla JM.
