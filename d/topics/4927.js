A full understanding of the potential consequences associated with cranial irradiation is needed both to manage potential complications and to properly counsel patients and families prior to treatment.</p><p>The complications of radiation therapy are usually divided into acute effects that can occur during radiation or up to six weeks afterwards, early-delayed effects that appear up to six months after radiation, and late effects that can develop six months or more after the completion of radiation. Unlike acute and early-delayed reactions that are usually reversible, late reactions are generally irreversible.</p><p>The late complications of fractionated cranial irradiation will be reviewed here. Early complications of brain radiation therapy and complications of spinal cord and peripheral nerve irradiation are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complications of cranial irradiation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of spinal cord irradiation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachial-plexus-syndromes#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brachial plexus syndromes&quot;, section on 'Neoplastic and radiation-induced brachial plexopathy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbosacral plexus syndromes&quot;, section on 'Radiation plexopathy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4143597\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effects of radiation can be divided into the effects on the vasculature of the brain as well as the direct effects on neuroglial cells and their precursors, including stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, inflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption, induced by radiation, may also cause direct or indirect cellular damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In preclinical studies, endothelial damage occurs within the first 24 hours after a large single dose of radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The exact mechanism is not known, but endothelial cell apoptosis appears to play a major role. Preclinical studies suggest that radiation may act directly on the plasma membrane of several cell types, activating acid sphingomyelinase and generating ceramide that initiates apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Endothelial damage can lead to subsequent disruption of the blood-brain barrier and other late vascular effects, such as telangiectasias, microvascular dilatation, and thickening and hyalinization of the vessel wall. As a result, ischemic strokes or brain hemorrhage, such as microbleeds, may occur months to years after brain radiation. (See <a href=\"#H4139197\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrovascular effects'</a> below.)</p><p>Tissue necrosis is a distinct syndrome of radiation toxicity, thought to be the consequence of vascular endothelial cell damage, resulting in fibrinoid necrosis of small vessels. Occlusion of these small blood vessels results in focal coagulative necrosis, capillary leakage, and demyelination of the surrounding brain parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The disruption of the blood-brain barrier (as visualized by gadolinium imaging) may be mediated in part through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that is released in response to hypoxia. Evidence supporting the role of VEGF in the pathogenesis of radiation necrosis comes from the observation that the imaging abnormalities seen with radiation necrosis may be reversed in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, a monoclonal antibody that binds VEGF. (See <a href=\"#H4139101\" class=\"local\">'Radiation necrosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Radiation induces an inflammatory response characterized by an increase in activated microglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and cytokine release, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The precise role of this inflammatory response in vascular and cellular damage is unknown and may be caused both by cellular damage and perpetuation of injury-induced inflammation, leading to a cycle of further cellular toxicity and tissue damage. </p><p>Increasingly, evidence from animal models suggests that radiation is cytotoxic to proliferating neuroglial progenitor cells with disruption of gliogenesis and neurogenesis, resulting in a decrease in the number of newly formed neurons in areas of the brain with neurogenic potential. For instance, the hippocampus contains a neural stem cell niche important to memory formation that is potentially quite radiosensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other regions vulnerable to the effects of radiation and relevant to brain plasticity include the periventricular area (subventricular zone) and white matter tracts harboring oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which have been shown to be sensitive to the effects of radiation. In humans, the cognitive impact of damage to areas of neurogenesis remains unclear but could equally be related to impaired white matter integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Loss of neurogenesis could lead to delayed cognitive deficits, even in the absence of identifiable changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (see <a href=\"#H4139131\" class=\"local\">'Neurocognitive effects'</a> below).</p><p>Advanced radiotherapy techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy or proton beam therapy, have therefore been suggested as a way to spare neurogenic niches, such as the hippocampus, when treating brain tumor patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases#H545656089\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of brain metastases&quot;, section on 'Neuroprotective strategies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4143771\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary risk factors influencing the likelihood of developing complications include the volume of normal brain tissue treated, the total radiation dose, the fractionation schedule, the use of concurrent medications, and underlying host variables.</p><p>The likelihood of brain damage increases in the young (ie, &lt;5 years old) and in older adult patients. Furthermore, the use of concurrent or sequential chemotherapy can significantly affect the incidence and severity of radiation-induced toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As an example, patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) treated with fractionated whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and chemotherapy are at particularly high risk for the development of severe cognitive impairment with imaging findings of significant white matter toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Moreover, genetic factors may make certain individuals more susceptible to otherwise safe doses of radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. For example, a study of 15 families with radiation-induced meningiomas after treatment for tinea capitis identified several genes as potential risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Other genetic markers have also been found to enhance susceptibility to radiation toxicity when specific organs are irradiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. A history of multiple sclerosis may also raise the risk of radiotherapy-induced neurotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4139101\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIATION NECROSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4143984\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebral radiation necrosis is a serious complication that typically develops one to three years after radiation, although the range is quite broad and cases have been reported more than 10 years after radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The dose that causes a higher than 5 percent risk of focal radiation necrosis using conventional 2 gray (Gy) fractionation is usually estimated to be 72 Gy, but this may be an oversimplification, and the dose that causes necrosis may vary by region of the brain as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Radiation necrosis is more likely to occur when high doses per fraction are administered and perhaps with concurrent chemotherapy or radiosensitizers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The risk of radiation necrosis after stereotactic radiosurgery has been reported to be higher, with a steep dose-response relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases#H2222087942\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of brain metastases&quot;, section on 'Complications of SRS'</a>.)</p><p>Radiation necrosis typically develops at or adjacent to the original site of tumor, the location that received the highest radiation dose. Radiation necrosis can also develop in part of the normal brain parenchyma that was included in the treatment field of a tumor outside the brain, such as temporal lobe necrosis that develops in some patients treated for a nasopharyngeal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In this setting, brain tissue necrosis typically results in new focal neurologic signs, and imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may show an enhancing mass lesion with edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-early-and-locoregionally-advanced-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of early and locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Treatment-related complications'</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms produced by localized brain necrosis depend upon the location of the lesion and can include focal neurologic deficits or more generalized signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Brainstem necrosis can produce severe clinical sequelae, including gait and balance problems, as well as multiple cranial neuropathies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4139107\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differentiating recurrent tumor from radiation necrosis can be very difficult by imaging. Conventional MRI typically shows a contrast-enhancing mass lesion with central necrosis and reactive edema within or immediately adjacent to the site of the original tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the site of highest dose of radiation. These imaging features are entirely overlapping with the radiographic appearance of high-grade primary brain tumors and brain metastases, and therefore image interpretation can be challenging.</p><p>Conventional imaging features that may be more suggestive of radiation necrosis than tumor include lack of a clearly defined T2 mass lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and high edema to enhancing lesion volume ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The test of time can be the most helpful feature, since spontaneous improvement in edema and lesion volume over time is generally inconsistent with active tumor and very suggestive of evolving radiation necrosis. Conversely, worsening imaging features are nonspecific and can be associated with either process. Follow-up imaging after one to two months can be helpful to evaluate for rapid interval changes and to guide further management decisions.</p><p>Other imaging modalities have been investigated in an attempt to differentiate radiation necrosis from active tumor, however, no single imaging modality has proven to be sufficiently specific to establish a diagnosis. Perfusion-weighted MRI may show decreased cerebral blood volume (CBV) associated with radiation necrosis, whereas active tumor is more likely to be associated with increased CBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted MRI suggests active tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A high lipid peak on MR spectroscopy suggests necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-34</a>]. Increased uptake with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/35-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-40</a>] or methionine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] positron emission tomography (PET) or thallium chloride-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] all suggest tumor, whereas lack of uptake is more suggestive of necrosis.</p><p>Ultimately, biopsy of the suspicious lesion may be required for a definitive diagnosis, particularly in patients who are symptomatic and have worsening imaging findings over time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4139113\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many cases, radiation necrosis is a self-limited process that can be managed conservatively without intervention. In patients who are symptomatic, we suggest initial treatment with a moderate dose of glucocorticoid (eg, 4 to 8 mg of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> daily), which usually produces prompt symptomatic improvement by reducing cerebral edema. Once symptoms are controlled, corticosteroids can then be gradually tapered over the course of several weeks. Follow-up imaging after one to two months is generally recommended.</p><p>In patients who do not achieve symptomatic response to corticosteroids, or when corticosteroids cannot be tapered without return of symptoms, a variety of other treatment options have been explored, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> and interstitial laser thermal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Retrospective case series and a small, randomized clinical trial indicate that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> may be useful in selected cases of cerebral radiation necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/44-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-50</a>]. In a double-blind clinical trial, 14 patients with radiographic or biopsy-confirmed cerebral radiation necrosis were randomly assigned to bevacizumab&nbsp;(7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every three weeks for four doses) or a saline placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. All patients assigned to bevacizumab had improvement in neurologic symptoms or imaging findings based upon MRI criteria. No responses were seen in those initially treated with placebo, but all patients who progressed on placebo did respond to bevacizumab&nbsp;during treatment crossover. Other case series have reported slightly less favorable symptom response rates of 75 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>], and there is at least one report of worsening of clinical symptoms with bevacizumab therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>The optimal dose and duration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> for treatment of radiation necrosis have not been established. In small series, symptomatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic relapse after discontinuation of bevacizumab has been described in 2 of 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and 11 of 20 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Some of these patients may respond to retreatment with bevacizumab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. While no serious adverse events were reported in the randomized trial, additional studies are needed to better determine the safety profile of bevacizumab in the management of radiation necrosis as well as the optimal dose and duration of treatment. The risks and side effects of bevacizumab therapy for other indications are discussed separately.

Surgery can provide palliative benefit by reducing mass effect and decreasing steroid requirements postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Minimally invasive laser interstitial thermal ablation is also being explored as a therapeutic intervention; biopsies can be obtained during the same procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/43,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,54</a>]. Therapeutic anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy have been reported to provide benefit in small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>], but their efficacy has not been established prospectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530642151\"><span class=\"h1\">PSEUDOPROGRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudoprogression is a term used to refer to subacute treatment-related effects that can mimic tumor progression, typically in the setting of combined radiotherapy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> for high-grade glioma. Imaging studies in patients with pseudoprogression demonstrate increased contrast enhancement and vasogenic edema, usually occurring within three months of completion of chemoradiation, which later stabilize or subside on follow-up studies without a change in therapy.

The toxicity of cranial irradiation in children has been studied in a variety of settings, with the highest doses being used in children treated for primary tumors of the central nervous system, somewhat lower doses used in children receiving prophylactic brain irradiation (PCI) as part of their treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These issues are discussed in detail separately.

Early-delayed effects typically impact learning and memory up to three months to one year following WBRT, whereas more significant long-term effects that broadly impact cognition can occur greater than one year after WBRT.</p><p>Early and selective effects on short-term recall and verbal fluency, as measured by tests such as the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), have been best described in prospective trials of WBRT for brain metastases and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small randomized trial found that adding WBRT to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) increased the likelihood of HVLT decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In this study, 52 percent of patients who received SRS plus WBRT experienced a drop of &ge;5 points in the HVLT at four months. While the HVLT results of this study may have been in influenced in part by the inferior overall survival of patients receiving SRS plus WBRT, a similar decline in HVLT at 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment was appreciated in a large multicenter study of PCI versus observation for non-small cell lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Another study found similar and selective effects on recall at four months in patients with brain metastases treated with WBRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A larger randomized trial of SRS plus WBRT versus SRS alone in patients with one to three brain metastases corroborate these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In this trial, cognitive impairment, defined as a decline &gt;1 standard deviation (SD) from baseline in any of six neurocognitive test batteries at three months, was more likely in the WBRT plus SRS group (92 versus 64 percent). On individual measures, the addition of WBRT led to more pronounced decline in immediate recall (30 versus 8 percent), delayed recall (51 versus 20 percent), and verbal fluency (19 versus 2 percent) compared with the group treated with SRS alone. &#160;</p><p/><p>In addition to learning and memory decline, WBRT has also been shown to impact patient-reported quality of life, as measured by the cognitive component of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ-C30). In a large multi-institutional trial of patients with one to three brain metastases, WBRT added to SRS was associated with greater decline in patient-reported cognitive functioning at one year compared with SRS alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Similar results were also reported in a pooled secondary analysis of multicenter trials of PCI for lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>While these studies have clearly demonstrated early-delayed effects of WBRT on cognitive function, characterization of long-term effects (ie, one year or longer) is complicated by the fact that most patients with brain metastases survive less than six months after WBRT. In addition, there are multiple factors that may impact cognition in these patients, including brain metastases themselves, concurrent treatment modalities (surgery, chemotherapy), the effects of medications, baseline neurocognitive dysfunction, and comorbidities (eg, vascular risk factors and diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>With these limitations, the available data suggest that nonspecific diffuse white matter changes can be seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in nearly all patients receiving WBRT doses of 20 Gy or higher and who survive longer than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].

When severe, these radiographic changes can be associated with the clinical syndrome of leukoencephalopathy involving ataxia, confusion, memory loss, dementia, and rarely death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Severe leukoencephalopathy occurs in less than five percent of patients and is influenced by the use of large fraction sizes for WBRT.

An understanding of the risks of neurocognitive dysfunction after partial brain radiation in adults is derived primarily from patients with low-grade gliomas who have received involved field radiation therapy. The effects of cranial irradiation upon neurocognitive function in these patients are particularly important, since patients often have extended survival. </p><p>Collectively, existing clinical studies suggest that in adults with brain tumors, early cognitive dysfunction is often related to the tumor itself. In long-term survivors, however, focal radiation may impair cognitive function in a significant subset of patients, even when fraction size is limited and contemporary, image-guided technologies are used to deliver highly conformal radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Significant and progressive structural brain changes (eg, cortical thinning, decreased whole-brain and gray matter volume, increased ventricular volume) have been demonstrated as early as four weeks following focal radiation with concurrent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> in patients with glioblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. &#160;</p><p>In an observational study with the longest follow-up, 195 patients with low-grade glioma, including 104 who had received radiation therapy, were compared with a control group of healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Six years after initial treatment, the low-grade glioma patients had lower ability in all cognitive domains compared with controls. However, the use of radiation was not associated with poorer cognitive function, except among patients who received a daily radiation dose greater than 2 Gy, where compromised memory was observed. In the same study, anticonvulsant medication was associated with a sixfold increase in risk of compromised capacity for perceptual tasks and inattention and executive function, effects that may be attributed to either medications or seizures. Details concerning the total dose and volume treated in patients who received greater than 2 Gy per fraction were not provided, and there might have been unrecognized negative selection biases, since patients with more extensive disease might have been treated with higher doses per fraction in view of an expectation of a poorer prognosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent study by the same group evaluated the effects of radiation in a subset of 65 patients who were assessed for cognitive effects at a mean of 12 years after initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. All patients were considered clinically stable since their first assessment. Radiation had been part of the original treatment in 32 patients (49 percent). In all but two cases this had consisted of focal radiotherapy rather than WBRT, and in all but three cases, the fraction dose was &le;2 Gy. At the second assessment, patients who had received radiation had significant impairment compared with patients who did not receive radiation as part of their original treatment in three cognitive domains: executive functioning, information processing speed, and attention. Detailed analyses suggested that these deficits could not be attributed exclusively to dose fraction or anticonvulsant usage, and that these deficits were at least in part attributable to radiation. </p><p/><p>One potential source of bias, however, is that patients who were treated with radiation immediately after diagnosis were compared with patients who had survived without a recurrence. Patients not treated initially with radiation who recurred prior to the second analysis were excluded from the comparison cohort. Thus, it is not possible to know the average degree of cognitive impairment in a population of patients with low-grade glioma who were not treated with radiation initially when potentially adverse effects of tumor recurrence are factored in.</p><p>In a prospective study of 203 patients with low-grade glioma who were randomized to receive either a lower dose (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions) or a higher dose (64.8 Gy in 36 fractions) of postoperative radiation therapy, most patients maintained stable neurocognitive function over time as measured by the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Five percent of those without tumor progression had a significant decline in MMSE scores (&gt;3 points) five years after treatment, however (all in the low-dose radiation arm). Importantly, the MMSE has significant limitations for assessing neurocognitive function due to a lack of sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>], and therefore these study findings likely represent an underestimation of the actual degree of radiation-associated cognitive decline.</p><p>The potential contributing effects of other anticancer treatments, particularly systemic chemotherapy, must also be considered. Limited data in low-grade glioma patients are potentially reassuring, however. Cognitive function was assessed using the MMSE in 251 patients with high-risk low-grade who were randomly assigned to receive either radiation alone or radiation in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lomustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lomustine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> (PCV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. After five years of follow-up, no significant difference could be detected in cognitive function between the groups. As discussed above, the poor sensitivity of MMSE testing in neurocognitive assessment remain a significant limitation of this study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864044054\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurocognitive dysfunction in patients who have received cranial radiation is often multifactorial. An initial evaluation should include a thorough history to identify potential contributing factors other than prior radiation, such as medication side effects, underlying mood disorders, and sleep disturbances. Mental status and cognition function should be assessed clinically in each patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-mental-status-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The mental status examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Formal neurocognitive and neuropsychologic testing is not generally necessary but can be useful in some patients in order to establish a baseline of neurocognitive function, since symptoms might progress over time. An underlying mood disorder might be uncovered by detailed neuropsychologic assessment. In addition, detailed neurocognitive testing helps to identify the exact pattern of cognitive deficits, which can guide further therapeutic interventions, such as neurocognitive rehabilitation.</p><p>Recent neuroimaging should be reviewed to identify alternative, and potentially reversible causes of cognitive decline that occur with increased frequency in patients with brain tumors and prior radiation, such as hydrocephalus. An extensive laboratory evaluation is typically of low yield aside from screening for common vitamin deficiencies (eg, vitamin B12 deficiency), metabolic abnormalities, and thyroid dysfunction.

This is generally mild and has been most frequently reported in patients treated for lymphoid malignancies of the orbit and ocular adnexa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/112,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">112,113</a>]. The incidence and severity varies with the radiation dose to the lacrimal gland as the rate of dry eyes increases with doses above 30 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4139227\"><span class=\"h2\">Retinopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinal injury due to retinal ischemia can also occur after radiation. Radiation retinopathy is often asymptomatic and is found incidentally on fundoscopic exam. If symptomatic, it presents as painless loss of vision months to years after radiation. Risk factors for radiation retinopathy include radiation dose, prior chemotherapy, and diabetes. In one study of 64 patients receiving radiation for head and neck tumors, 27 eyes in 26 patients developed symptomatic radiation retinopathy resulting in visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/200</span> or worse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Fourteen of the injured eyes developed rubeosis iridis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neovascular glaucoma. No patient receiving less than 45 Gy developed retinal complications, but the incidence of retinopathy increased with higher doses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4139239\"><span class=\"h1\">OTOTOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tinnitus and high frequency hearing loss are adverse effects that occasionally occur during cranial irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. These symptoms are often due to radiation-induced otitis media, causing mucosal vasodilatation and eustachian tube edema. Symptoms typically resolve spontaneously, but occasional patients need myringotomy for symptomatic relief.</p><p>Hearing loss months to years after radiation is usually due to sensorineural damage that occurs in patients treated for head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/117-120\" class=\"abstract_t\">117-120</a>]. This was illustrated by a review of 325 patients treated for head and neck tumors between 1964 and 2000 at a single institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. Sensorineural hearing loss was observed in 15 percent of patients, and multivariate analysis showed that age and radiation dose to the cochlea were significant risk factors. For patients who were receiving doses over 60.5 Gy, the five-year risk of clinically overt hearing loss was 37 percent.</p><p>Late sensorineural hearing loss also has been reported in children who are treated with cranial irradiation for brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/121,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">121,122</a>]. In a study of 78 children who were assessed by audiometry and who had not received platinum-based chemotherapy, hearing loss was documented in 11 cases (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. Ototoxicity was related to the dose of radiation to the cochlea, with higher frequencies being more sensitive to lower radiation doses. A cumulative cochlear dose less than 35 Gy was recommended for patients receiving a total tumor dose of 54 to 59.4 Gy in 30 to 33 fractions.</p><p>Hearing loss can also occur with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy or radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas).

Abnormalities can develop as early as one year after completion of therapy, and the prevalence rises over time. As a result, patients who have received radiation to the hypothalamus or pituitary region should have a baseline endocrine evaluation within a year of completing radiation and annual blood work to screen for dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

The prevalence of any degree of hypopituitarism ranged from 37 to 77 percent, with a follow-up time of 3 to 13 years after radiation.

However, cranial irradiation is associated with risks of various acute and late toxicities, and these risks should be acknowledged and discussed during the pretreatment counseling session with any patient for whom cranial radiation is recommended. Unlike acute and early-delayed reactions that are usually reversible, late adverse effects are generally irreversible. (See <a href=\"#H4142467\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cranial irradiation can have deleterious effects on the vasculature of the brain as well as on neuroglial cells and their precursors. Inflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption may also indirectly contribute to cellular damage. (See <a href=\"#H4143597\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation necrosis is a serious complication that typically develops one to three years after radiation. Symptoms produced by localized brain necrosis depend upon the location of the lesion and can include focal neurologic deficits or more generalized signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. The risk increases with higher doses per fraction. Management is primarily symptomatic. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bevacizumab</a> may be useful in severe cases that have not responded to corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"#H4139101\" class=\"local\">'Radiation necrosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both focal brain radiation and whole brain radiation have been associated with a decline in neurocognitive function over time in some patients that can be difficult to differentiate from the effects of the tumor itself, other therapies such as surgery and chemotherapy, and concomitant medications such as anticonvulsants. Data regarding the neurocognitive effects of brain radiation are derived primarily from adults with brain metastases or low-grade gliomas. (See <a href=\"#H4139131\" class=\"local\">'Neurocognitive effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cranial irradiation has been associated with a variety of cerebrovascular complications, including occlusive vascular disease resembling Moyamoya, ischemic stroke, and intracerebral cavernous malformations that may cause intracranial bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H4139197\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrovascular effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional well-described late complications of cranial irradiation include cataracts, optic neuropathy, xerophthalmia, retinopathy, ototoxicity, and endocrinopathies. (See <a href=\"#H4139203\" class=\"local\">'Effects on the eyes and optic pathways'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4139239\" class=\"local\">'Ototoxicity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4139251\" class=\"local\">'Endocrinopathies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following cranial irradiation, there is an increased risk of secondary tumors, such as meningiomas, malignant gliomas, and nerve sheath tumors.
