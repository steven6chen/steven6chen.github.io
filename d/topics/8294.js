This particular serotype represented a set of alleles at the HLA-DRB1 gene locus. Subsequently, hundreds of studies have examined and expanded that association in order to better elucidate the genetic underpinnings of RA. Both linkage and association studies of the HLA-DRB1 gene have consistently confirmed that it is the major genetic susceptibility locus for RA. As such, it provides an important clue to RA pathogenesis.</p><p>Since about 2005, discoveries using high-throughput genotyping in large sample collections have identified over 100 additional genetic loci outside of the HLA locus that play a relatively modest role in RA risk but implicate critical pathways in its pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Further investigation has also begun to fine-map these RA loci, including the DRB1 gene. However, the issue of clinical utility of genotyping in patients with RA remains unresolved.</p><p>The role of HLA and other susceptibility genes in RA will be addressed in this topic review. The epidemiology of, risk factors for, causes of, and pathogenesis of RA, as well as an overview of HLA genes and their nomenclature, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of, risk factors for, and possible causes of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1335024292\"><span class=\"h1\">HLA SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">HLA alleles and susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both linkage and association studies have established that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 gene is the major genetic susceptibility locus for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Interpretation of early studies of HLA associations in RA has been complicated by evolving changes in nomenclature and methods of HLA typing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Originally, HLA typing was achieved with immunological reagents. The methods subsequently used for HLA typing in RA have involved amplification by the polymerase chain reaction of the highly polymorphic second exon of the HLA-DRB1 gene, followed by probing with a DNA sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe. Direct nucleotide sequencing is an alternative method of genotyping. A newer technique for HLA typing has since been developed for further analysis of individuals with available dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data over the HLA region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H4298962\" class=\"local\">'Individual amino acid sites and rheumatoid arthritis risk'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Individual alleles and the shared epitope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two alleles, DRB1*04:01 and DRB1*04:04, primarily account for the originally observed serological association of DR4 with RA in Caucasians. In addition, serological associations with DRB1*01 and DRB1*10 alleles have been noted in many Caucasian RA patients who are negative for DRB1*04 alleles. (See <a href=\"#H29498370\" class=\"local\">'Associations in different ethnic populations'</a> below.)</p><p>Since many of these most strongly associated RA alleles shared a region of highly similar amino acid sequence, it had been postulated that this portion of the DRB1 molecule (amino acids 67 to 74) controls susceptibility to disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The most strongly associated RA alleles code for HLA proteins which share a region of highly similar amino acid sequence at positions 70 to 74, called the shared epitope (SE; <sup>70</sup>QKRAA<sup>74</sup>, <sup>70</sup>QRRAA<sup>74</sup>, or <sup>70</sup>RRRAA<sup>74</sup> &ndash; one-letter amino acid code). This hypothesis had been further bolstered by the observation that among ethnic populations in which DRB1*04 alleles are rare, the alleles associated with RA still contain the SE. As an example, some Native-American populations, such as the Yakima Nation, have a high prevalence of RA. DRB1*04 alleles are rare in this population, and RA is possibly associated with the DRB1*14:02 allele. This allele has an amino acid sequence from positions 67 to 74 that is identical to the SE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The strength of the association of particular HLA susceptibility alleles with RA varies in different studies. To some degree, this variability is due to differences in the criteria for inclusion of patients, in genetic backgrounds of the populations studied, and in the HLA typing methods used. However, a remarkable degree of consensus emerges when these variables are controlled. If, for example, only Caucasian patients are included and if the HLA typing is DNA-based, then similar results have been obtained in different reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA-DRB1*04:01 &ndash; Present in 50 to 61 percent of patients with RA with a relative risk of 5 to 11.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA-DRB1*04:04 &ndash; Present in 27 to 37 percent with a relative risk of 5 to 14. In one report, an increased risk of RA was noted when there were two copies of the HLA-DRB1*04:04 allele or when it was present along with another gene encoding the SE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA-DRB1*10 &ndash; Present in 1.5 percent of RA patients with a relative risk of 2.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA-DRB1*01:01 &ndash; Present in 13 to 27 percent with a relative risk of 1 to 2.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3320096\"><span class=\"h3\">Protective HLA alleles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While some specific HLA-DRB1 alleles confer a high risk for the development of RA, other alleles provide protection from disease risk. As an example, certain alleles with an aspartic acid (versus glutamine or arginine) at the 70<sup>th</sup> amino acid position result in an odds ratio (OR) of 0.23 and 0.34 for RA among English and Spanish populations, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and in an OR of 0.52 among North American RA populations. In addition to the presence of aspartic acid at position 70, the presence of isoleucine at position 67 is also associated with a protective effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A large meta-analysis across multiple European populations has shown that HLA-DRB1*13:01 confers protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4298962\"><span class=\"h3\">Individual amino acid sites and rheumatoid arthritis risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small number of individual amino acid sites within HLA-DRB1 that explain RA risk susceptibility have been identified. It has become possible to use large SNP genotyping data sets to infer HLA-DRB1 alleles indirectly using advanced statistical methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>]. Using these approaches, a study of 20,000 individuals of European descent has demonstrated that individual amino acid sites within HLA-DRB1 explain RA risk susceptibility most effectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In particular, position 11 (and equivalently position 13 which is tightly linked to it) modulates more RA risk than any position in the genome; the presence of a valine at that site confers an allelic OR of approximately 4, whereas the presence of a serine corresponds to an allelic OR of 0.4. Additionally, positions 71 and 74 (located within the SE consensus sequence) mediate disease risk independently of the amino acid present at position <span class=\"nowrap\">11/13</span>. This study has also suggested that any individual of Caucasian origin, instead of being classified as SE-positive or -negative, can be classified into 16 different risk categories solely based on their four-digit HLA-DRB1 type or the amino acids carried at positions <span class=\"nowrap\">11/13,</span> 71, and 74 of HLA-DRB1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The highest-risk categories correspond to SE-positive individuals, while the lower-risk categories are defined by protective HLA alleles (for example, HLA-DRB1*13:01).</p><p>Side chains of amino acids at positions <span class=\"nowrap\">11/13,</span> 71, and 74 point into the antigen-binding groove and together fall within a specific pocket within the DR molecule known as the P4 pocket. These results suggest that the P4 pocket may play an important role in differential antigen binding, affecting disease risk. Investigators have also begun to study the implications of variation in amino acid residues for citrullinated peptide antigen binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. HLA-DRB1 alleles that result in a neutral or negative charge in the P4 pockets are protective, as they are associated with a reduced risk of RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>After controlling for HLA-DRB1 associations at positions <span class=\"nowrap\">11/13,</span> 71, and 74, independent associations with anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA)-positive RA are observed at HLA-DPB1, corresponding to amino acid position 9 of that molecule; in HLA-B, corresponding to HLA-B*08 and equivalently to position 9 of that molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]; and at HLA-A position 77 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These amino acid sites also sit at the base of the binding groove of those proteins.</p><p>The HLA region on chromosome 6 contains over 200 genes of immunological relevance. Several studies have suggested that loci other than HLA genes may also contribute to susceptibility to RA, but these studies are challenging to interpret due to the strong effects of the HLA alleles and to the high degree of linkage disequilibrium across the HLA region. For example, early reports of an association of RA with other classical HLA genes, such as alleles of HLA-DQA1, and with other non-HLA genes, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), were likely to be secondary to linkage to HLA-DRB1, -DPB1, -B, or -A risk alleles. The genes for TNF lie within the HLA region and have been a focus of intense interest, given the demonstration that TNF-alpha plays a central role in the inflammatory cascade in affected joints of patients with RA and the efficacy of TNF-alpha antagonists as therapeutic agents for patients with RA. Results of such investigations, however, have been conflicting; some studies report an association of particular TNF markers with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>], while others find no differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>]. The association with TNF is most likely a function of alleles in linkage with HLA-B*08 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29498370\"><span class=\"h3\">Associations in different ethnic populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data have accumulated on HLA associations with RA in diverse ethnic populations, many of which display a very different genetic background from Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Nevertheless, the vast majority of these studies confirm a significant increase in the frequency of alleles containing the SE in RA patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among Japanese, the most prevalent DRB1*04 allele is DRB1*04:05, which contains the SE and which is increased in Japanese patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both DRB1*04:05 and *04:04 are increased in Chinese RA patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DRB1*14:02 confers susceptibility to RA in the Yakima, Tlingit, and Pima Native-American populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,33,34</a>]. The DR4 specificity is also present and associated with RA in the Chippewa Indians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p>In some population groups, such as the Spanish, the Basque, and Israeli Jews, DRB1*04 alleles are rare. In these settings, RA is associated with DRB1*01 or DRB1*10, two other alleles carrying the SE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>].</p><p>In other populations, such as African Americans, the majority of patients with RA do not carry the SE in their DRB1 genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Even in this study, however, DR4-positive (DR4+) susceptibility alleles were significantly increased among rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive patients. A similar observation was made in a study of Greek patients with RA; although 57 percent lacked the SE, its presence was still significantly increased compared with local controls (43 versus 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Indeed, further studies examining amino acid sites observed, similar to populations of European decent, that position 13 mediated much of the risk of RA in Asian populations; and the same residues at that site that conferred risk in European populations also did so in Asian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Similarly, residues that protected from risk in European populations at position 13 also protected from risk in Asian populations.</p><p>In African-American populations, it was also observed that position 11 mediated risk of RA, with a similar risk profile as in Europeans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">HLA alleles and severity of rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies support an association of the SE with RA disease severity, based upon an association with erosive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>], but not all studies do so [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. Studies have found a correlation between DRB1*04 RA-associated alleles and more severe, erosive disease, as measured by the severity of radiographic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/45-47,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47,51,52</a>]; some have also noted an increase in DRB1*01 among patients with milder disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. A large prospective study that was performed in over 2000 patients of Caucasian origin concluded that the hierarchy of HLA-DRB1 alleles with regards to RA susceptibility is exactly the same for disease severity, measured as the extent of radiographic damage or by mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Therefore, the 16 different risk categories defined by amino acids at positions <span class=\"nowrap\">11/13,</span> 71, and 74 of HLA-DRB1 (see <a href=\"#H4298962\" class=\"local\">'Individual amino acid sites and rheumatoid arthritis risk'</a> above) also represent 16 different severity categories. However, the clinical utility of this genetic stratification system remains to be evaluated. Moreover, it seems that the association of HLA with severe disease acts mainly through the presence of ACPA, and it is clear that ACPA status is a better predictor of erosions than are HLA alleles or the SE status. (See <a href=\"#H24811710\" class=\"local\">'Relationship between HLA-DRB1 and ACPA'</a> below.)</p><p>This association between HLA-DRB1*04 alleles and erosive disease has been confirmed among non-Caucasian patients as well, including Koreans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>] and Japanese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The specific combination of SE-positive alleles also may be important. One report evaluated a large group of patients with severe RA, including many with Felty's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. A hierarchy of risk was found, depending upon the particular combination of HLA-DRB1 alleles: the relative risk was 5 with the heterozygous <span class=\"nowrap\">HLA-DRB1*04/X</span> combination (where X is any allele other than HLA-DRB1*04 or HLA-DRB1*01); 16 with <span class=\"nowrap\">HLA-DRB1*04/</span> HLA-DRB1*01; 25 with <span class=\"nowrap\">DRB1*04/</span> HLA-DRB1*04 combinations; and 49 with <span class=\"nowrap\">HLA-DRB1*04:01/04:04</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(Dw4/Dw14)</span>.</p><p>The presence of a SE in an HLA-DRB1 allele may predispose to other extraarticular disease manifestations as well. This was illustrated in a group of RF-positive patients with erosive disease, almost one-half of whom had two SE-positive alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Individuals whose SEs were contained in DR4+ alleles (HLA-DRB1*04:01, *04:04, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> *04:08) had the highest risk of extraarticular disease, including rheumatoid vasculitis, rheumatoid lung disease, and Felty's syndrome. Patients heterozygous for two SE-containing alleles, one DR4+ and one DR4-, had disease of intermediate severity.</p><p>The association of DRB1*04 susceptibility alleles with erosive disease is also present in non-Caucasian patients, including Koreans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>] and Japanese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2178226455\"><span class=\"h2\">HLA genes and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of ACPA at disease onset is the strongest predictor of later radiographic damage in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Most studies also support an association of the SE with erosive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The role of genetic predictors of disease outcome remains a focus of active research for the following reasons: 1) the relative effect of ACPA titers and HLA alleles on several measures of disease outcome is still unknown; 2) genetic markers are likely to have added value to ACPA on the prediction of severity; and 3) there is substantial interest in the prediction of disease onset (inextricably linked to future severity) before ACPA seroconversion (for example, in cohorts of first-degree relatives of patients with RA).</p><p>The presence of the SE alleles is not only associated with more severe joint injury, but also with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. In 2004, a meta-analysis of the impact of SE-positive alleles on erosive disease summarized the results of 10 studies (1027 patients) and found that carriage of one or two such alleles was associated with an OR of having joint erosion of about 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The retrospective association of specific HLA alleles with severe RA raised the question of whether typing may be useful to predict which patients will progress to destructive disease, as HLA markers, unlike levels of serological markers like RF or acute phase reactants, are stable over time and are not subject to fluctuation with disease course or treatment.</p><p>Cardiovascular disease is a common comorbidity in RA and is associated with reduced life expectancy in patients with RA. Several studies have shown that carrying two copies of SE alleles is associated with premature mortality and with cardiovascular mortality, and this effect appears independent of ACPA status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/60-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-64</a>].

This is particularly striking for the HLA-DRB1 gene in which, for example, the linkage to the HLA region observed in RA families is absent in anti-CCP-negative families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

For example, a significantly greater prevalence of anti-CCP antibodies was found in those who carried two SE alleles than in those with one or no allele (85, 58, and 30 percent, respectively). Hence, the SE seems to predispose to anti-CCP-positive RA, and the development of anti-CCP antibodies is likely to be an intermediate stage in disease pathogenesis and to mediate the effect of the SE with RA susceptibility <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severity. Subsequent studies in much larger cohorts of anti-CCP-negative RA patients have, however, detected significant associations between the SE, HLA alleles, specific amino acids, and anti-CCP-negative RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/19,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,73</a>].

Hence, it has been speculated that smoking leads to increased citrullination of proteins. Carriage of SE alleles in this environmental background increases susceptibility to RA because they bind citrullinated peptides more strongly and induce an exaggerated T-cell response. The exaggerated T-cell response, in turn, may drive the increased autoantibody production by B cells, including anti-CCP antibodies, seen in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1405573522\"><span class=\"h1\">GENES OUTSIDE THE HLA REGION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">RA susceptibility genes outside the HLA region</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a role in conferring susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is well-accepted for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes within the HLA region on chromosome 6, most investigators estimate that HLA contributes to less than 50 percent of the overall genetic risk. The availability of increasingly powerful molecular genetic techniques has ignited the search for other relevant genes in RA. This has generally taken two approaches: investigating candidate genes whose function suggests a possible role in disease pathogenesis, and screening the entire human genome using genome-wide association studies.</p><p>A number of genes outside of the HLA region also exhibit an association with RA, and some are associated with other autoimmune conditions as well. Over 100 confirmed associations with RA susceptibility have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Since 2007, there has been an explosion in the number of RA susceptibility genes identified and confirmed in well-powered cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3,81-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,81-84</a>]. For most of the reported associations, the actual causal variant has not been identified, and the gene thought to be responsible for the association may change as fine-mapping studies are undertaken. Most associated variants are intergenic or intronic variants that do not confer a change in the amino acid sequence of gene protein products. These studies are underway, so a better understanding of which genes are involved, whether the same variants are associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, and whether multiple variants at a locus contribute to susceptibility should become clearer as research progresses.</p><p>The R620W PTPN22 polymorphism has been consistently associated with RA in populations of northern European descent, but the variant does not exist in Japanese or Korean populations. The association with anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA)-positive RA is much stronger than with ACPA-negative RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

The W620 variant of PTPN22*R620W binds Csk less efficiently than the R620 allele, which may predispose to autoimmunity by resulting in a failure to switch off T cells. In other experiments, however, the polymorphism has been shown to be a &quot;gain of function&quot; variant (ie, it increases the downregulation of T cells). This is postulated to predispose to autoimmunity by failure to delete autoreactive T cells during thymic development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. A study has also demonstrated that levels of the 620W PTPN22 variant are decreased in human T and B cells, and its calpain binding and cleavage were increased relative to wild-type 620R. Based upon mouse experiments, this difference was attributed to calpain-mediated degradation. Reduced levels of the protein correlated with an increased number of T cells and increased T-cell activation, and with dendritic-cell hyperresponsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>STAT4 gene</strong> &ndash; STAT4 encodes a transcription factor that transmits signals induced by several key cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-12 and type 1 interferons, as well as IL-23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

HLA-DRB1 risk is best explained by a single amino acid position at the base of the binding groove, position 13 (or equivalently position 11). Additional associations to positions 71 and 74 implicate the P4 binding groove strongly. Furthermore, HLA-DPB1 position 9, HLA-B position 9, and HLA-A position 77 are also independently associated with the risk of developing RA, but to a lesser extent.

The presence of certain risk alleles may also predispose to extraarticular disease manifestations. A small number of non-HLA genetic loci also appear associated with more severe disease. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'HLA alleles and severity of rheumatoid arthritis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'RA severity genes outside the HLA region'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Theories to explain how expression of the shared epitope (SE) contributes to RA focus on the role of the HLA molecule in binding specific peptides and in presenting them to CD4+ T lymphocytes via recognition by the T-cell receptor. The polymorphic residues in the class II molecule determine which peptides are bound with high affinity. Molecules containing the SE bind a different array of peptides than those not containing it. Several different models have been proposed to explain how the SE functions to contribute to RA. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Mechanistic implications of the HLA associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is emerging evidence that anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA)-positive and ACPA-negative RA may behave very differently and may comprise distinct diseases underpinned by distinct genetic contributions within and outside the HLA region. The SE predisposes mainly (but not only) to ACPA-positive RA, and the development of ACPA (with resultant positive testing for anticyclic citrullinated peptide [CCP] antibodies) may be an intermediate step mediating the effect of the SE with RA susceptibility <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severity. The effect of the HLA on ACPA-negative RA susceptibility is smaller and has been localized to some HLA positions also involved in ACPA-positive RA, but different amino acids confer risk and protection for ACPA-negative versus ACPA-positive RA. (See <a href=\"#H24811710\" class=\"local\">'Relationship between HLA-DRB1 and ACPA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA may contribute less than 50 percent of the overall genetic risk for RA. Loci within the HLA region other than HLA-DRB1 may also contribute to susceptibility, and a number of genes outside of the HLA region also exhibit an association with RA, some of which are also associated with other autoimmune conditions. Most associated variants outside the HLA region are intergenic or intronic variants that do not confer a change in the amino acid sequence of gene protein products. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'RA susceptibility genes outside the HLA region'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knowledge of a patient's HLA status and other genetic markers may be useful with further developments in diagnosis and screening, in estimating prognosis, and in predicting the response to specific therapies, but a role for HLA testing in RA outside the research setting has not been established. As an example, patients with one or especially two doses of the SE may benefit from earlier, more aggressive treatment to control disease. However, most of the information and hypotheses regarding clinical utility of genetic testing are based primarily upon data derived from North American and northern European Caucasian patients, and HLA typing of patients from other ethnic groups will have different implications. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical use of genetic markers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H618132279\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Anne Barton, FRCP, PhD and Soumya Raychaudhuri, MD, PhD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">McMichael AJ, Sasazuki T, McDevitt HO, Payne RO.
