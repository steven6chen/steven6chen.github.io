(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of favorable prognosis early (stage I-II) classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These successes with RT, used either alone or in combination with other modalities, resulted in large cohorts of cancer survivors, who are subject to late complications from treatment. Analyses have shown that the therapeutic benefits from RT may be offset to some extent by delayed effects on the heart, thereby reducing the benefits of RT.</p><p>Irradiation of a substantial volume of the heart to a sufficiently high dose can damage virtually any component of the heart, including the pericardium, myocardium, heart valves, coronary arteries, capillaries, and conducting system. Pericarditis is the typical acute manifestation of radiation injury, while chronic pericardial disease, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, and conduction abnormalities can manifest years or decades after the original treatment. These complications can cause significant morbidity or mortality.</p><p>The data on the late cardiovascular toxicity of RT come primarily from survivors of breast cancer and HL, diseases in which RT is a frequent component of the initial management and in which survival is often prolonged. Similar effects may be present in other cancer survivors who receive thoracic RT, although data are more limited.</p><p>An awareness of the potential cardiotoxicity of RT led to the application of improved RT techniques that minimize irradiation to the heart. These contemporary techniques appear to have substantially decreased the incidence of delayed complications, although whether or not there still is some residual risk remains uncertain.</p><p>The pathophysiology of RT-induced cardiac injury and the clinical data on the magnitude of risk are presented here. RT-induced cardiotoxicity associated with Hodgkin lymphoma and pediatric malignancies is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-hodgkin-lymphoma-and-pediatric-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma and pediatric malignancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiologic pathway responsible for most manifestations of cardiotoxicity appears to involve damage to blood vessels. This injury is thought to be due to the generation of reactive oxygen species that disrupt DNA strands. Secondary inflammatory changes then lead to fibrosis.</p><p>The histologic hallmarks of radiation-associated cardiotoxicity are diffuse fibrosis in the interstitium of the myocardium with normal-appearing myocytes and narrowing of capillary and arterial lumens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Irregularities of the endothelial cell membranes, cytoplasmic swelling, thrombosis, and rupture of the walls are present. The ratio of capillaries to myocytes is reduced by approximately 50 percent, and this leads to myocardial cell death, ischemia, and fibrosis. Dense collagen and fibrin replace the normal adipose tissue of the outer layer of the heart, leading to pericardial fibrosis, effusion, and rarely, tamponade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>These changes can have several consequences:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary artery disease (CAD) results from injury to the intima of the coronary arteries. This initiates a cascade of events that is typical of atherosclerosis, including replacement of damaged cells by myofibroblasts and deposition of platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The distribution of arteries affected by RT reflects the dose distribution. As an example, the left anterior descending and the right coronary arteries are most often involved in patients receiving mediastinal RT for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and the left anterior descending artery receives more radiation during treatment for left-sided breast cancer. Arterial narrowing is typically proximal and often involves the coronary ostia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cusp <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leaflets of valves may undergo fibrotic changes with or without calcification. Changes to valves on the left side are more common than those on the right, regardless of the relative dose distribution of RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Patient-related factors that may increase the risk of radiation-induced cardiotoxicity include younger age at the time of treatment and the presence of other risk factors for coronary heart disease (eg, hypertension, smoking).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BREAST CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incidental radiation to the heart as part of the initial treatment of breast cancer can result in a range of cardiotoxic effects including coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease, valvular dysfunction, and conduction abnormalities. Cardiotoxicity is related to both the volume of heart irradiated and the radiation dose delivered to that volume.</p><p>Older RT techniques for treating the breast, chest wall, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> draining lymph nodes delivered relatively high doses of radiation to portions of the heart. Contemporary techniques expose a smaller volume of the heart and are associated with a reduced risk of cardiotoxicity. However, it is unclear if there is a &quot;safe dose&quot; with no increased risk. Low radiation doses may initiate an inflammatory cascade that persists and augments the risk for cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A case-controlled study suggested that an increased risk of cardiac disease can be seen after relatively low doses of radiation (approximately 2 Gy averaged across the heart from higher doses to small cardiac volumes), that the clinical manifestation of this increased risk can be seen throughout a broad continuum of follow-up durations (eg, from &lt;5 years to &ge;20 years), and the absolute magnitude of the effects of radiation are higher in patients with cardiac risk factors since the presence of cardiac risk factors markedly increases the baseline risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Despite this, the absolute risk associated with RT is small and appears to be outweighed by the benefits in patients for whom radiation is typically recommended.</p><p>Randomized trials conducted over the last 30 years demonstrate the overall positive impact of <span class=\"nowrap\">post-lumpectomy/mastectomy</span> radiation on local control and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These benefits were achieved despite the use of some older radiation techniques. With more modern approaches, the absolute benefits of radiation may be increased, as has been suggested in some reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-for-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques for newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evidence of cardiovascular toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardiovascular toxicity of chest wall irradiation following mastectomy was initially identified in a retrospective analysis of 1461 long-term survivors of breast cancer who were treated from 1949 to 1955 and then followed for up to 34 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The women in this cohort had originally been randomly assigned to RT given immediately or delayed RT until the time of a local recurrence. After 15 years, there was a significantly increased mortality in those given immediate RT (relative risk [RR] 1.43) that was attributable to excess deaths from cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Subsequent meta-analyses confirmed these initial observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. The largest, which explored the impact of RT on breast cancer mortality and on mortality from other causes, was conducted by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), which evaluated 19,582 women enrolled in 40 randomized trials of RT versus no RT that were begun before 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Although the use of RT decreased the annual mortality rate from breast cancer by 13 percent, the annual mortality rate from other causes was increased by 21 percent. The increased nonbreast cancer-related mortality was primarily due to an excess number of deaths from vascular causes (death rate ratio 1.30, compared with those not receiving RT).</p><p>Most, if not all, of the individual trials in the meta-analyses were initiated before 1975 and used RT techniques that would now be considered suboptimal because of excessive cardiac irradiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Contemporary RT techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the potential cardiotoxicity of RT was recognized, treatment techniques were modified to minimize incidental cardiac irradiation.

However, the absolute risk increase for coronary artery disease and cardiac death was only 76 and 126 cases, respectively, per 100,000 person-years. For coronary artery disease, the risk increased within the first decade, and for cardiac mortality, it increased in the second decade.</p><p>Although previous randomized trials have not suggested a difference between irradiated patients and controls in regards to cardiac morbidity or death, this may be due, in part, to a relatively shorter follow-up. For example, in randomized trials conducted by the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG 82b and 82c), among 3083 patients with high-risk stage II or III primary breast cancer randomly assigned to adjuvant systemic treatment with or without RT following mastectomy, there were no significant differences between irradiated patients and controls with respect to either death or morbidity from ischemic heart disease or acute myocardial infarction at a median follow-up of 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Importantly, in these studies, postmastectomy chest wall irradiation improved survival in high-risk women with breast cancer, and the benefit of chest wall irradiation more than outweighed any increase in cardiac morbidity and mortality.

The increased risk can be seen within the first five years and remains elevated for at least 20 years. Women with significant risk factors for an acute coronary event may be at a particularly increased risk.</p><p>This effect of RT was demonstrated in a population-based case-control study that included 2168 women who were treated for breast cancer with surgery and RT in Sweden and Denmark between 1958 and 2001. The study included 963 women who experienced a significant coronary event (myocardial infarction, revascularization, or death from ischemic heart disease) following their treatment for breast cancer. These women were compared with 1205 matched controls who received similar therapy for their breast cancer but did not have a cardiac event following breast cancer treatment. RT records were reviewed for all patients, and the dose of radiation to the heart estimated for each patient.</p><p>Results included the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was increased risk of major coronary events following RT for all time periods from the period less than five years through greater than 20 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated mean dose of radiation to the heart was 4.9 Gy (calculated by averaging a high radiation dose to a small cardiac volume across the entire heart); the dose of radiation to the heart was greater in those with a left-sided breast cancer (6.6 versus 2.9 Gy). The risk of a coronary event increased progressively with the radiation dose, with a relative increase of 7.4 percent for each 1 Gy of radiation to the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of ischemic heart disease before cancer therapy was associated with an increased risk of a cardiac event after treatment for breast cancer (ratio 6.67, p&lt;0.001). Other factors associated with a significantly increased risk included other circulatory disease, diabetes, or a left-sided breast cancer (risk ratios 1.88, 3.23, and 1.32, respectively).</p><p/><p>Only a very limited number of patients received potentially cardiotoxic medications (eg, anthracyclines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>), which might substantially increase the risk associated with RT. However, this analysis did not take into account other cardiac complications of radiation (cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, arrhythmias).</p><p>The impact of radiation dose on the risk of ischemic heart disease was confirmed in a smaller study that analyzed cardiac outcomes in a population treated with a consistent RT technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Additional evidence comes from tumor registry studies that have analyzed the rate of cardiac complications in breast cancer survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/12,17-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17-23</a>]. These studies have yielded conflicting results but suggest that there is an increase in cardiac events in women with left-sided breast tumors compared with right-sided cancers since the latter received lower doses of irradiation to the heart. Two of the larger studies illustrate the potential impact of RT based upon the laterality of the tumor:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, outcomes were analyzed from 115,000 women in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database who received adjuvant RT in the United States between 1973 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. For patients irradiated between 1973 and 1982, cardiac mortality was significantly higher in women with left-sided breast cancers and the difference was more pronounced with longer follow-up (cardiac mortality ratio [CMR] for left-sided versus right-sided cancers 1.20, 1.42, and 1.58, at &lt;10, 10-14, and &gt;15 years, respectively). However, for women treated from 1983 to 1992, the differences were less pronounced and not statistically significant, and none of the patients treated from 1993 on had 10-year follow-up. This decrease in excess mortality may reflect improvements in RT techniques, shorter follow-up, or other unknown factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second SEER database study, the risk of death from ischemic heart disease was analyzed in a cohort of 27,283 women with breast cancer whose treatment included adjuvant RT during the period 1973 to 1989 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For women diagnosed between 1973 and 1979, there was a significantly higher 15-year mortality rate from ischemic heart disease for women with left-sided versus right-sided tumors (13.1 versus 10.2 percent). For those diagnosed from 1980 to 1984, and from 1985 to 1989, the differences in 15-year mortality rates for women with left-sided versus right-sided tumors were not significant (9.4 versus 8.7 percent and 5.8 versus 5.2 percent, respectively). The overall incidence of death from cardiac disease decreased substantially with the later cohorts.</p><p/><p>The absolute increase in risk of a major coronary event or death from ischemic heart disease is small. In the case control study comparing women given RT who had a major coronary event with those did not have a coronary event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], the authors calculated that the risk that a 50-year-old women with no other coronary risk factors would die of ischemic heart disease prior to age 80 years would increase from 1.9 to 2.4 percent if she received a mean dose of radiation of 3 Gy to her heart; the risk of having at least one major coronary event would increase from 4.5 to 5.4 percent. If the mean dose to the heart were 10 Gy, the risk of dying would increase from 1.9 to 3.4 percent, and the risk of having at least one acute coronary event would increase from 4.5 to 7.7 percent.</p><p>Data suggest that the cardiac risk associated with breast cancer radiation is higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, though still low for both groups. In a patient data meta-analysis including approximately 41,000 breast cancer patients randomly assigned to receive or not receive adjuvant radiation in 75 trials, those receiving radiation had an increased cardiac mortality (relative risk [RR] 1.3, 95% CI 1.15-1.46) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The risk of radiation-associated cardiac mortality was higher for smokers, translating to an absolute increase of 1.0 percent, versus 0.3 percent for nonsmokers.</p><p>Numerous other studies, using either overall morbidity and mortality frequencies or less detailed individual patient data, confirm that the effect of radiation on the heart is small compared with the benefit potentially derived from such treatment in appropriately selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/25-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Surrogate endpoints of myocardial injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in the incidence of cardiac morbidity and mortality represent the &quot;gold standard&quot; endpoints for evaluating the risk of RT-induced cardiotoxicity. However, there are several drawbacks to this approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac injury is typically a &quot;late effect&quot; that may only become apparent many years or even decades after RT. Without prolonged follow-up, cardiac events attributable to RT are unlikely to be observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary artery disease is frequent in North America and Europe. Thus, analysis of large numbers of patients is required to detect a statistically significant difference in the ratio of observed to expected events in women who have or have not received RT for breast cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Competing causes of death (breast cancer itself, other noncardiac causes, age-related illnesses) are likely to obscure any increase in cardiac mortality observed following RT unless a cohort of relatively young, favorable-prognosis breast cancer patients is studied.</p><p/><p>To provide an early assessment of possible myocardial injury, studies have used radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging to look for RT-induced cardiac changes. In the largest prospective series, 160 women were treated with tangential photons to the left breast or chest. Patients underwent serial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-gated cardiac myocardial perfusion scans for up to six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of new perfusion defects was related to the volume of myocardium included in the radiation field.

Thus, cardiotoxicities associated with RT should be very similar in the postlumpectomy and postmastectomy settings, if the irradiated volumes are similar. However, this is usually not the case; in the postmastectomy setting, the RT field often includes the nodal tissues, and these nodes are not always targeted in the post-lumpectomy setting. Thus, postmastectomy RT is more often associated with cardiac disease (compared with postlumpectomy RT), but this is likely a result of the usually-larger irradiated volumes in the former. </p><p>Details of adjuvant radiation therapy are discussed elsewhere.

These cardiac effects have been manifested as coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction, need for revascularization, death from ischemic heart disease), cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease, valvular dysfunction, and conduction abnormalities.</p><p>Improvements in RT technique significantly decreased the amount of incidental radiation received by the heart. These technical advances substantially reduced the incidence of cardiovascular complications compared with older studies. However, cardiovascular complications still appear to be more frequent in patients with left-sided compared with right-sided tumors, suggesting that the risk has not been entirely eliminated.</p><p>The key factors that appear to influence the risk of delayed cardiovascular toxicity include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The RT field and dose, which determine the amount of incidental irradiation to the heart. As an example, studies that separately analyzed the risk in patients who received internal mammary lymph node irradiation partially or entirely with anterior photon fields found an increased risk of cardiovascular complications compared with those in whom the internal mammary lymph nodes were not included in the field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

One of the more interesting findings in a contemporary case controlled study was the detection of an increased rate of cardiac events relatively soon after RT, which was sooner than is typically ascribed to RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Indeed, in a study of 236 breast cancer survivors (median age 51 years [range 30 to 70], median observation time 12 years [range 9.2 to 15.7]) treated with four-field RT of 50 Gy (median cardiac dose 2.5 Gy [range 0.5 to 7]), there was no correlation between measures of cardiac dose and coronary artery calcification as measured by Agatston score. However, Agatston score was associated with attained age at time of coronary artery calcification assessment and baseline total cholesterol on multivariate adjustment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Particular caution is indicated when RT is used in patients who have or will receive known cardiotoxic agents, such as an anthracycline or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

The overall incidence of pericardial effusion was 36 percent, occurring at a median of six months after treatment; symptomatic effusions occurred in 14 cases (8.4 percent). The incidence of symptomatic effusions was higher in those treated with two-dimensions versus three-dimensional conformal techniques (11 of 70 [16 percent] versus 3 of 97 cases [3 percent]). Increasing doses of radiation to the pericardium was the strongest risk factor for toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186936808\"><span class=\"h1\">LUNG CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, RT-associated cardiac injury in patients with lung cancer has not been considered to be too clinically relevant. However, there are some contemporary data to suggest that clinically meaningful cardiac injury is occurring in patients irradiated for lung cancer.</p><p>The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) examined the role of RT dose-escalation in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy, randomizing patients to receive 60 or 74 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Overall survival was worse in the high dose arm, with the curves separating within six months after RT. On multivariate analysis, the volume of heart receiving &ge;5 Gy and &ge;30 Gy were independent predictors for overall survival, thus implicating RT-related heart disease as a potential cause for the worsened survival rates seen in the high-dose arm. Unfortunately, heart-specific toxicities were not assessed in this trial. These data suggest that to the degree that the poorer survival in the high dose arm was due to cardiac disease, RT-associated cardiac injury can occur relatively soon after RT.</p><p>In a series of 112&nbsp;patients treated on several radiation dose-escalation trials at the University of North Carolina, there was an association between the rate of subsequent cardiac events (including acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, symptomatic effusions, and pericarditis)&nbsp;and both heart dose and baseline cardiac risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The two-year rate&nbsp;of&nbsp;symptomatic cardiac events after adjustment for the competing risk of death was 21 percent&nbsp;with mean heart doses&nbsp;&ge;20 Gy versus only 7 and 4 percent with mean heart doses 10 to 20 Gy and &lt;10 Gy, respectively. The median time to event was 26 months (range 1 to 84).&nbsp;These findings are consistent with the findings of RTOG 0617, and support the contention that RT-associated cardiac injury can occur relatively soon following RT for lung cancer and that this might be clinically meaningful. Similarly, other reports in patients with lung cancer noted a correlation between increasing cardiac doses, and increased rates of cardiac toxicity and reduced rates of overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. </p><p>Similarly, a recent report from Washington University in patients with lung cancer noted a correlation between increasing cardiac doses, and increased rates of cardiac toxicity and reduced rates of overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. When stratified by heart V50 less than 25 versus 25 percent or greater, the one-year overall survival rates were 70.2 versus 46.8 percent, and the two-year overall survival rates were 45.9 versus 26.7 percent. </p><p>In a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-based analysis of over 34,000 patients more than 65 years of age receiving a variety of therapies for NSCLC, the relative risk of cardiac dysfunction in the patients receiving RT alone was 1.5, and the relative risk was 2.4 for those managed with chemoradiotherapy compared with those not receiving RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].
