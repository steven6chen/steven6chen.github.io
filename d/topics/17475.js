The role of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI; also known as transcatheter aortic valve replacement or TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is evolving. A multidisciplinary team approach is recommended in approaching patients with symptomatic AS.</p><p>This topic will review periprocedural management of TAVI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Indications for aortic valve replacement, SAVR, estimating the risk of aortic valve surgery, medical therapy of symptomatic AS, and percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty are discussed separately.

The indication for valve intervention (surgical aortic valve replacement [SAVR] or TAVI) and choice of therapy based upon potential risks and benefits of treatment options should be discussed at a multidisciplinary heart team meeting. This should comprise interventional and noninterventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, imaging cardiologists, and possibly critical <span class=\"nowrap\">care/respiratory</span> physicians, etc. Potential risk factors such as depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and prior stroke and pulmonary disease should be considered. Potential access issues and likely delivery approach should be discussed since this may impact the risk-benefit analysis of treatment options. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for valve replacement in aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-therapy-for-symptomatic-severe-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of therapy for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Preprocedural testing should include routine blood tests (including complete blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine), electrocardiogram, echocardiography (and may require stress echocardiography if low gradient aortic stenosis is being assessed), and coronary angiography. Comprehensive computed tomography angiography to assess aortic annulus geometry and peripheral access is now considered the standard of care in assessing TAVI candidates. Preprocedural imaging is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation#H29659669\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging for transcatheter aortic valve implantation&quot;, section on 'Preprocedural assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis#H3764159903\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of low gradient severe aortic stenosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1026836981\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H360704828\"><span class=\"h2\">General management and monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for all patients undergoing TAVI prior to surgical incision or vascular access to reduce the risk of wound infection and endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Patients undergoing TAVI generally receive a temporary pacing lead, at least one large bore intravenous line, warming to avoid hypothermia, and monitoring by arterial line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A pulmonary artery catheter is seldom used during the procedure. Transesophageal echocardiography is commonly performed, particularly when general anesthesia is used. Heparin is administered after placement of standard sheaths and prior to placement of the large sheath. </p><p>Patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI receive either local anesthesia with moderate (conscious) sedation or general anesthesia, while those having alternative access (including transaortic and transapical approaches) will invariably have general anesthesia. Outcomes from the two approaches to anesthesia are broadly similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Increasingly, as center and operator experience has grown significantly, there has been a move toward performing the procedure with a less invasive approach. While practice varies a lot, this term encompasses the procedure being carried out under conscious sedation with local anesthesia, without transesophageal echocardiography, and with selective use of temporary pacing. Some operators have moved away from having anesthesia support at all and have dispensed with central venous access.</p><p>All procedures, however, require early identification and treatment of volume depletion and use of inotropic agents in patients with low cardiac output or greater than moderate pulmonary hypertension. Measures to avoid prolonged hypotension include maintenance of mean arterial pressure of &gt;75 mmHg prior to initiation of rapid ventricular pacing (required during valve placement of prostheses other than the Evolut <span class=\"nowrap\">R/PRO</span> or LOTUS valve, and can be performed during the Evolut <span class=\"nowrap\">R/PRO</span> procedure as well) with cautious use of intravenous vasopressor (norepinephrine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a>) therapy as needed while avoiding hypertension. It is now rare to require mechanical circulatory support in patients with low cardiac output undergoing TAVI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-term mechanical circulatory assist devices&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Management of complications is discussed separately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4232087102\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three major catheter-based techniques for replacing the aortic valve have been investigated: peripheral access (including femoral, <span class=\"nowrap\">subclavian/axillary,</span> or rarely, carotid artery), direct aortic access (via either ministernotomy or right anterior thoracotomy), and direct transapical access. A transseptal approach was previously studied, but adoption has been abandoned due to procedural complexity and associated risks (eg, development of acute mitral regurgitation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. A more recently described transcaval approach has been used as an alternative access approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The retrograde femoral arterial approach is the most common method of TAVI delivery. The use of the transfemoral approach is now favored and indeed feasible in up to 95 percent of patients in some registries, reflecting smaller sheath sizes in newer generation devices. It is now rare for a transfemoral approach to be excluded by access given that two major (commercially available) valve delivery systems are now 14 to 16 F equivalent. Vessel size of less than 5 mm together with circumferential calcium would represent a contraindication, as well as extreme vessel tortuosity. Peripheral artery imaging (computed tomography and, in some cases, invasive angiography) is performed to determine feasibility and risk of a transfemoral approach, as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation#H29659676\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging for transcatheter aortic valve implantation&quot;, section on 'Determining eligibility for peripheral vascular access'</a>.) </p><p>For patients who are not candidates for the transfemoral approach due to unfavorable iliofemoral artery characteristics, the most common current alternatives are two transthoracic approaches (transaortic retrograde approach and the transapical antegrade approach) and the subclavian approach. The choice between these alternatives will depend upon which valve type is being selected as well as operator and hospital experience.</p><p>The clinical advantage of the transfemoral approach to TAVI over surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) appears to be greater than that for transthoracic access TAVI compared with SAVR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This may simply reflect the fact that those undergoing alternative access have a much higher burden of vascular disease and comorbidities in general. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2204284419\"><span class=\"h3\">Percutaneous retrograde approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The retrograde femoral arterial approach via the aortic arch and through the diseased valve is the most common approach. Several types of stent-valve devices with various designs have been successfully implanted using the retrograde femoral approach. The most widely used types are balloon-expandable valves (SAPIEN 3, which has replaced the Cribier-Edwards, SAPIEN, and SAPIEN XT valves), the self-expanding valves (eg, Evolut <span class=\"nowrap\">R/PRO</span> and the ACURATE neo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and the mechanically expanded LOTUS valve (currently unavailable as delivery system is being refined). The SAPIEN XT and SAPIEN 3 valves can be delivered via the transapical or direct aortic approach as described below. The Evolut <span class=\"nowrap\">R/PRO</span> has also been delivered in a retrograde fashion from the <span class=\"nowrap\">subclavian/axillary</span> artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], the carotid artery, and via direct aortic access via either ministernotomy or right anterior thoracotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Smaller delivery devices have resulted in an increasing rate of femoral delivery (eg, from approximately 50 percent to nearly 95 percent), as well as lower incidence of vascular complications, with an emerging standard of percutaneous vascular closure and a shorter hospital stay. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H814844386\"><span class=\"h3\">Transaortic surgical retrograde approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative retrograde surgical approach can be performed by direct insertion into the ascending aorta (eg, aortotomy) via a small median sternotomy or lateral thoracotomy at the second intercostal space. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2113701460\"><span class=\"h3\">Transapical antegrade approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternate catheter-based approach consists of direct left ventricular apical puncture and antegrade aortic valve implantation via a small anterolateral thoracotomy without cardiopulmonary bypass or sternotomy. This approach is particularly suited to patients with severe peripheral artery disease and heavily calcified ascending aorta and arch (porcelain aorta) who have an increased risk of stroke and other embolic events using other approaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H152416871\"><span class=\"h2\">Implantation technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic procedure consists of three phases. The first is to obtain vascular access for delivery of the valve. Secondly, imaging of the aortic root must be obtained and displayed to ensure that the operators have a clear image of the aortic annulus in a coplanar view, with all three aortic cusps, equidistant and aligned. Pre-procedural computed tomography angiography will assist significantly with this. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-for-transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging for transcatheter aortic valve implantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A balloon valvuloplasty may be performed prior to delivery of the valve, although this is now done in only a proportion of patients. Finally, the valve is delivered, and the range of implantation techniques and methods, and use of pacing, varies widely. Different valve designs and methods of expansion mandate a very different approach to delivery depending upon the type of valve being used. However, some principles are universal.</p><p>The valve should be correctly positioned in the aortic annulus, extending below the plane of the annulus by between 2 and 6 mm, depending upon the valve design. It should be positioned to avoid paravalvular leaks, and coronary occlusion. Its position should be checked with fluoroscopy and possibly echocardiography as well. Any paravalvular leak that is present should be quantified with a combination of echocardiography, angiography, and pressure measurement of the aortic regurgitation index. If the valve is of a recapturable and repositionable type, then consideration should be given as to whether this is appropriate. Finally, the need for a post-deployment valvuloplasty should be considered to improve frame expansion if this is a concern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2695560269\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-PROCEDURAL CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6499292\"><span class=\"h2\">Antithrombotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients receive intravenous heparin during valve implantation followed by chronic antiplatelet therapy after implantation. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic antiplatelet therapy typically involves three to six months of dual antiplatelet therapy followed by aspirin-only therapy:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Following implantation of the SAPIEN valve, the following antiplatelet regimen is recommended and consistent with US Food and Drug Administration labeling since this was the protocol used in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]: dual antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 75 or 100 mg daily plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> 300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg daily) for six months; and after six months, aspirin 75 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for life. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evolut <span class=\"nowrap\">R/PRO</span> operators typically recommend three months of dual antiplatelet therapy with daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> followed by daily aspirin for life. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>However, for patients on anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation, practice varies.

The above described dual antiplatelet regimens used in the first three to six months following TAVI contrasts with the intermediate-term (first three months) anticoagulation commonly suggested following surgical aortic bioprosthetic valve replacement. A meta-analysis of two observational and two randomized studies found that dual compared with single antiplatelet therapy was associated with more major bleeding and no significant improvement in 30-day outcomes post-TAVI, but these data should be interpreted with caution since the results were largely driven by the results of nonrandomized studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>For both surgical and transcatheter bioprosthetic aortic valves, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 75 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is used as long-term antithrombotic therapy. </p><p>Some concern has been raised about the risk of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis post-TAVI with standard antiplatelet therapy, and some observational data suggest that the risk of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis is reduced with anticoagulation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications#H1273824592\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Complications&quot;, section on 'Valve thrombosis'</a>). As noted in the 2017 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> focused update of the valvular disease guideline, some experts suggest anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 for three months or more after TAVI in patients with low risk of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-periprocedural-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].
