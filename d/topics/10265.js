Mosquitoes carry the parasite and spread it to people by biting them.</p><p>Malaria is common in many countries. It can be mild or severe. Severe malaria can cause serious health problems and even death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71683754\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of malaria?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body aches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tiredness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach problems &ndash; These can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loss of appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diarrhea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin that looks yellow &ndash; This is called &quot;jaundice.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fast heart rate or breathing</p><p/><p>Severe malaria can cause other symptoms, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seeing or hearing things that are not really there</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dark or bloody urine</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71683769\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See a doctor or nurse right away if you get a fever while you are traveling or after you come back. Be sure to tell your doctor or nurse where you traveled, including any airports where you changed flights.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71683784\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If the doctor or nurse thinks you have malaria, he or she will order a blood test to look for the parasite that causes it. There are several different types of the parasite. If you have malaria, the doctor needs to know which type you have so he or she can give the right treatment. A blood test can also show if malaria is causing other health problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71683799\"><span class=\"h1\">How is malaria treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors give medicines to get rid of the parasite that causes malaria. There are several different medicines. Some people need to take more than 1.</p><p>Most people can take pills by mouth, but people with severe malaria need treatment in the hospital. They get medicine through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p>After you start treatment, you will have blood tests every day for a few days. The tests are to make sure the medicine is working. If not, the doctor can give a different medicine. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71683814\"><span class=\"h1\">Can malaria be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you travel to an area where malaria is common, taking medicine can help keep you from getting it. If you plan to travel outside the United States, tell your doctor or nurse as soon as possible. He or she can prescribe medicine if you need it. Take it exactly as the doctor tells you, or it might not work.</p><p>Taking malaria medicine is important even if you travel to a place where you used to live and are going back to visit friends or relatives.</p><p>You can also reduce your risk by preventing mosquito bites. To do this, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay inside at night &ndash; This means any time after sunset and before sunrise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear shoes, long-sleeved shirts, and long pants when you go outside.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear bug spray or cream that contains DEET or a chemical called picaridin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep in a building with good screens over the windows and doors or air conditioning. Or, you can sleep under a bed net treated with bug spray.</p><p/><p>People can get malaria even while taking medicine to prevent it. If you get sick during or after travel to an area where malaria is common, and you were taking malaria medicine, see a doctor or nurse. Be sure to tell him or her you traveled to an area that has malaria and that you were taking medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71683829\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women have a higher risk of getting malaria than other people, and they can get much sicker. Malaria can cause the following problems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A miscarriage &ndash; This is when a pregnancy ends on its own before a woman has been pregnant for 20 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A baby that is born too small, too early, or infected with malaria</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Death of the mother or baby &ndash; The baby could die before or after birth.</p><p/><p>If possible, pregnant women should avoid areas where malaria is common until about 2 months after the baby is born.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71683844\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-infections-in-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Avoiding infections in pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=staying-healthy-when-you-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Staying healthy when you travel (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-infections-in-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Avoiding infections in pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-travel-advice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: General travel advice (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
