Differences in fetal growth rates were not believed to manifest until the second half of pregnancy. However, these beliefs were challenged after analysis of data from thousands of first-trimester ultrasound examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Early delay in fetal growth has been documented in pregnancies with precise gestational age dating, and appears to be predictive of subsequent adverse perinatal outcomes, such as fetal aneuploidy, growth restriction, and preterm birth. These perinatal outcomes can affect health and disease risks later in life. </p><p>In this discussion, the term &quot;fetus&quot; will be used regardless of gestational age, even though &quot;embryo&quot; is the biological term for early human life (ie, implantation through eight weeks postconception) and &quot;fetus&quot; is the biological term for human intrauterine life thereafter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF FIRST-TRIMESTER GROWTH DELAY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of growth delay is based upon fetal size that is smaller than expected based on last menstrual period (LMP),early sonographic dating, or timing of embryo transfer in pregnancies resulting from assisted reproductive technology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105010\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105010 \">table 1</a>). Thus, it is crucial to have accurate information on the fetus' gestational age and the normal size range for fetuses of that age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pitfalls in determining gestational age</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of last menstrual period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When clinicians date a pregnancy based on menstrual weeks (menstrual age), the first trimester of pregnancy is defined as the time interval beginning on the first day of the LMP and ending 13 weeks later. However, this calculation can lead to errors in assessment of gestational age and, in turn, estimated delivery date (EDD) because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many women do not have regular 28-day cycles and thus do not ovulate (or conceive) on day 14 of the cycle. The difference between the observed and expected size of <span class=\"nowrap\">embryos/fetuses</span> is thus biased towards smaller than expected measurements since the timing of ovulation is skewed to the second half of the cycle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early pregnancy bleeding or recent use of hormonal contraceptives may lead to an incorrect assumption of the date of the last menstrual period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some women are uncertain of the date of their LMP.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of mean sac diameter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mean sac diameter (MSD) is the average internal diameter of the gestational sac and may be utilized to determine gestational age when an embryo is not identified, but this measurement is less accurate than crown rump length measurements for gestational dating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of crown rump length</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is consistent high quality evidence supporting measurement of crown rump length (CRL) as the best method for gestational dating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/7-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-22</a>]. Once CRL can be measured, it should be used to estimate gestational age, rather than the mean sac diameter or an average of mean sac diameter and CRL. Gestational age assessment by ultrasound is most accurate when the CRL is measured between 6 and 10 weeks of gestation since there is less biologic variation and linear growth at that time. Interestingly, the growth rate in the first trimester does not appear to be linear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/3,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,23</a>]. There appears to be a change in growth rate between 9 and 10 weeks of gestation. The 9- to 10-week mark signifies the ending of the embryonic period and the beginning of the fetal period with a shift from organogenesis to growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CRL early in gestation is visualized better with transvaginal sonography (TVS) than with transabdominal sonography (TAS), but the transvaginal approach is not more accurate for determining gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. TVS is also more useful in women with a high body mass index. The CRL should represent the longest length of the fetus, excluding the limbs and yolk sac. It is determined by placing calipers at the outer edge of the cephalic pole and the outer edge of the <span class=\"nowrap\">embryonic/fetal</span> rump. For optimum accuracy in dating pregnancies, we recommend that three independent CRL measurements be obtained and then averaged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>When the ultrasound equipment is purchased, it comes with a choice of programs to calculate gestational age based on the biometry measurements obtained during an examination. We, like many other practices, use the Robinson tables for these calculations. One equation that performs well for calculating gestational age from CRL is [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/9,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,26</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Gestational age (days) = (8.052)(CRL in <span class=\"nowrap\">mm)(1/2)</span> + 23.73</p></div></div><p>The reported accuracy of CRL for estimation of gestational age depends upon the method used for validation (eg, LMP, known date of conception) and the gestational age when the measurement was obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/7,9,10,12-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,10,12-21</a>]. Early and late first-trimester CRL measurements (less than 9 mm and greater than 70 mm) are less precisely correlated with a specific gestational age so there is a wider confidence interval (CI) around the gestational age estimate at these times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/8-10,13,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10,13,27</a>]. For this reason, some experts use biparietal diameter (BPD) to estimate gestational age after 10 weeks of gestation, but there is no consensus on this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/11,12,16,24,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,16,24,28</a>]. In our practice, we use CRL for the majority of <span class=\"nowrap\">embryo/fetuses</span> in the first trimester. As the gestational age progresses, the CRL lengthens, the fetus curls up, and it is often more difficult to get a straight line measurement of the CRL due to its contour. For this reason, measurement of the BPD or FL may be used to determine gestational age in some late first-trimester fetuses. We start using a combination of BPD, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length to calculate gestational age at 14 weeks.</p><p>The 95% CI for the gestational age estimate can be derived by using a constant error of &plusmn;8 percent (2 standard deviations) of the estimate or by reporting variability in terms of specific days (&plusmn;2 to &plusmn;11 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Clinically, a practical approach is to use the sonographically derived gestational age to calculate EDD if it differs from that calculated using the LMP by more than seven days (some practices use five to seven days) in the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The variability of predicting gestational age increases as pregnancy progresses. Using a constant error of &plusmn;8 percent of the estimate throughout the first trimester is also an option. We re-date pregnancies in the first trimester if the CRL differs by more than seven days compared to menstrual dates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105010\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105010 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Factors other than pregnancy duration may affect the accuracy of CRL for estimating gestational age, but the available evidence is inconclusive:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first trimester, the CRL of twins and triplets does not appear to differ significantly from that of singletons of the same gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/7,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,29</a>]. However, the fetuses in a multiple gestation often have different CRLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Just as in singletons, the gestation should be re-dated in the first trimester if the CRL differs by more than one week compared with the menstrual dates. If the twin CRLs are discordant, we use the larger CRL to establish the gestational age as using the smaller twin's CRL may underestimate actual gestational age. We suggest obtaining a follow-up scan in two weeks to assess interval growth in discordant cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal gender may have an effect.

As with late pregnancy growth delay, early growth delay may be due to a suboptimal intrauterine environment (including disorders of placentation) or may represent a constitutionally small fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay/abstract/2,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,42,43</a>].

Since detection of CRL discordance at 11 to 14 weeks is associated with increased adverse pregnancy outcomes but has low predictive accuracy, this finding does not warrant a major change in the usual close monitoring of twin pregnancies, but heightened awareness for the above pregnancy complications is suggested. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues#H348913135\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin pregnancy: Prenatal issues&quot;, section on 'Monitoring in the second/third trimesters'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of growth delay is based upon <span class=\"nowrap\">embryonic/fetal</span> size that is smaller than expected for gestational age based on last menstrual period, early sonographic dating, or timing of embryo transfer in pregnancies resulting from assisted reproductive technology. Thus, it is crucial to have accurate information on the fetus' gestational age and the normal range for crown rump length (CRL) for fetuses of that age.

However, small CRL can also be due to inaccurate menstrual dates. Obtaining a follow-up scan in two weeks is helpful to assess interval growth. Continued lag in size is worrisome for impending demise or aneuploidy. If a significant fetal growth delay is present, genetic counseling and testing may be offered in the first or second trimester.

(See <a href=\"#H81259823\" class=\"local\">'Risk of other adverse outcomes'</a> above.)<br/><br/>However, there is still a paucity of data regarding how this information can be used to change pregnancy management. In our ultrasound laboratory, if the CRL measurement lags menstrual dating by more than seven days in a well-dated first-trimester pregnancy (earlier ultrasound, assisted reproductive technology), we use the larger twin's CRL to date the pregnancy and repeat the evaluation in two weeks.
