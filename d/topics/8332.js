Self-monitoring includes assessing the frequency and severity of symptoms (such as wheezing and shortness of breath) and measurement of lung function with a peak flow meter.</p><p>Peak flow meters measure your peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), a number that correlates with how open the lung's airways are; as asthma worsens and the airways narrow, the PEFR decreases. Monitoring can help you and your healthcare provider determine the most appropriate asthma treatment plan.</p><p>A number of articles about asthma are available. For children, (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-symptoms-and-diagnosis-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma symptoms and diagnosis in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-avoidance-in-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Trigger avoidance in asthma (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>).</p><p>For adults, (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ASTHMA MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experts recommend that people with moderate to severe persistent asthma, or who have asthma attacks, have a peak flow meter at home and know how to use it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/how-to-use-a-peak-flow-meter-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A peak flow meter is small, inexpensive, and easy for most patients to use.</p><p>The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) recommends that patients use a peak flow meter to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regularly monitor lung function and response to treatment over the short- and long-term</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine the severity of an asthma attack</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess response to treatment during an attack</p><p/><p>You should use an asthma diary to record your daily peak flow meter readings, exposure to potential asthma triggers, asthma medication use, and asthma symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68404\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef68404 \">form 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76505\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef76505 \">form 2</a>). This can help to show a cause-and-effect relationship between exposure to triggers and decreases in peak flow. You can review the asthma diary with a healthcare provider to make decisions about asthma treatment.</p><p>Peak flow meter readings can be used as part of your Asthma Action Plan, along with symptoms, to identify worsening of your asthma and need for additional treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53142\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef53142 \">form 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78132\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef78132 \">form 4</a>). You can discuss peak flow goals and treatment recommendations with your healthcare provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW TO USE A PEAK FLOW METER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peak flow monitoring should be performed on a regular basis, even when asthma symptoms are not present. Peak flow should also be checked if symptoms of coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath develop. You should demonstrate how to use a peak flow meter with your healthcare provider to verify that your technique is accurate.</p><p>Different brands of peak flow meters have unique features; however, these general instructions can be adapted to an individual's peak flow meter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Getting the best readings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several steps are important to make sure the peak flow meter records an accurate value:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The peak flow meter should read zero or its lowest reading when not in use.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use the peak flow meter while standing up straight.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take in as deep a breath as possible.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the peak flow meter in the mouth, with the tongue under the mouthpiece.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close the lips tightly around the mouthpiece.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blow out as hard and fast as possible; do not throw the head forward while blowing out.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathe a few normal breaths and then repeat the process two more times. Write down the highest number obtained. Do not average the numbers.</p><p/><p>IMPORTANT: Repeat the test if your tongue partially blocks the mouthpiece or if you cough or spit during the test. Most peak flow meters need to be cleaned periodically; cleaning instructions should be available when the unit is purchased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Establishing a baseline measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike a blood pressure reading or a cholesterol test, there is no peak flow measurement that is normal for everyone. For this reason, it is important to determine what peak flow value is normal for you.</p><p>To determine your <strong>normal</strong> peak flow measurement, you should measure your peak flow when you have no asthma symptoms. Perform three measurements with the same peak flow meter two to four times daily for two to three weeks.</p><p>You should note the highest peak flow measurement achieved; this is the &quot;personal best.&quot; This number is used to determine if future peak flow measurements are normal or low, and is also used to create a normal range (between 80 and 100 percent of the personal best peak flow measurement).</p><p>Readings below the normal range are a sign of airway narrowing in the lungs. A low peak flow measurement can occur before asthma symptoms such as wheezing or shortness of breath develop.</p><p>Remeasure your personal best peak flow value once per year to account for growth (in children) or changes in the disease (in both children and adults). In addition, verify home peak flow measurements with readings taken with equipment in a healthcare provider's office since this equipment is more sensitive. For long term management, most clinicians will recommend peak flow testing once per day, usually in the morning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ASTHMA EMERGENCY CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you do not improve or worsen despite treatment, you need emergency medical care. Severe asthma attacks can be fatal if not treated promptly. In most areas of the United States, you can call 911 for emergency medical assistance. Do not attempt to drive to a hospital or clinician's office on your own.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=366\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
