It has been used in numerous studies to evaluate the site of airway obstruction, airway luminal changes in patients with OSA, prediction of oral appliance outcomes, and the effects of mandibular repositioning devices, weight loss, or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) on airway caliber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Nasopharyngoscopy can be performed with the patient in either the sitting or supine position during wakefulness, spontaneous sleep, or sedative-induced sleep. The latter is typically referred to as drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE). Sleep nasopharyngoscopy is thought to be superior to awake nasopharyngoscopy at identifying sites of upper airway closure, but the supportive data for this assertion are not robust. It does not involve radiation exposure, but it is invasive and requires nasal anesthesia.</p><p>A Mueller maneuver (ie, inhalation with the nasal passages occluded and the mouth closed) performed during the procedure may simulate an obstructive apnea and provide insight into the location of upper airway obstruction. Since the Mueller maneuver is effort dependent, both the amount of negative pressure generated during the maneuver and the percentage of airway narrowing during the Mueller maneuver should be quantified in order to compare changes across subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In one study that compared DISE with awake nasopharyngoscopy with Mueller maneuver, the degree of obstruction caused by the soft palate and tongue was significantly underestimated by an awake procedure; in addition, 23 percent of patients showed evidence of laryngeal obstruction due to involvement of the epiglottis that was not assessable during wakefulness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In another study, severe retrolingual collapse was identified more often via DISE than the Mueller maneuver (85 versus 36 percent), and the discrepancy was particularly high in individuals with Friedman I and II tongue positions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Studies of the interrater reliability of DISE indicate that the assessment of sites of obstruction is more reliable than the degree of obstruction, and that reliability is better when the procedure is performed by experienced operators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. State-related changes in the upper airway during DISE should be quantified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>DISE is usually performed in the operating room, making it difficult to use as an imaging modality in large clinical studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cephalometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cephalometry is a lateral radiograph of the head and neck. It is widely available, easily performed, and inexpensive. However, it requires standardized radiographic equipment and techniques, as well as interpretative skills. In addition, it is performed only while the patient is sitting or standing, and has not been performed when the patient is asleep or supine.</p><p>Cephalometry provides two-dimensional evaluation of skeletal and soft tissue structures, giving limited information about anterior-posterior structures and no information about lateral soft tissue structures. It is useful in the evaluation of patients with bony facial abnormalities, such as retrognathia, and in the evaluation of oral appliances. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Oral appliances'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) is a widely available but is relatively expensive. Radiation exposure limits its usefulness for performing studies during wakefulness and sleep.</p><p>CT permits accurate determination of upper airway cross-sectional area and volume, with excellent resolution of the airway and bony structures. Images are acquired only in the axial plane, but spiral (ie, helical) CT provides direct three-dimensional volumetric reconstruction of images, allowing reconstruction of bony structures (cranium, mandible, hyoid) and the airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80062\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80062 \">image 3</a>). CT is also useful in the evaluation of patients with sleep apnea who are being considered for bony manipulations (dental appliances and maxillomandibular advancement).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Acoustic reflection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acoustic reflection is a technique that allows measurement of airway caliber on the basis of reflected sound waves. The advantages of acoustic reflection are that it is noninvasive, has no associated radiation, and can be readily repeated. However, it is performed in the sitting position and does not provide high-resolution anatomical representation of the airway or soft tissue structures. In addition, it is often performed through a mouthpiece and opening the mouth alters upper airway anatomy. Acoustic reflection has been used primarily as a research tool and its clinical utility has not been carefully assessed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Optical coherence tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optical coherence tomography is a new technique for real-time imaging of the upper airway during wakefulness and sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It involves placement of a thin, transparent catheter through the nares into the upper airway, through which an optical probe can move freely. As the probe moves along the length of the upper airway, it creates images based upon changes in the characteristics of the light reflected back from the tissues.</p><p>Optical coherence tomography avoids exposure to radiation and can be performed without sedation. The major limitation is that tissues can be hidden from the optical probes in patients with a very irregular upper airway. In addition, optical coherence tomography does not directly examine the surrounding deeper soft tissue structures. Evidence suggests that optical coherence tomography correlates well with CT scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper airway imaging is not indicated in the routine evaluation and management of most patients with OSA. It may be helpful in certain circumstances, such as the planning of upper airway surgery. However, validation of this approach has not been addressed in well-performed clinical trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UPPP is the most common surgical procedure for patients with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The success rate is related to the site of obstruction, with patients demonstrating retropalatal obstruction having better results than those with retroglossal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. UPPP is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Upper airway surgery'</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, we consider magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the upper airway prior to UPPP because it can identify patients with retroglossal collapse who are not ideal candidates for this type of surgery. Whether outcome is improved among those patients selected for UPPP based upon the results of MRI has not been studied. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>Alternatively, it is reasonable to perform drug-induced sleep endoscopy prior to upper airway surgery to try to determine the site of upper airway collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Nasopharyngoscopy and drug-induced sleep endoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients in whom MRI demonstrates primarily retroglossal narrowing or in whom drug-induced sleep endoscopy demonstrates retroglossal collapse, we consider surgery directed at advancing the tongue (eg, geniohyoid advancement or maxillomandibular advancement) in addition to UPPP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Maxillomandibular advancement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, we consider computed tomography (CT) prior to maxillomandibular advancement, a surgical procedure that moves the top of the jaw (maxilla) and the bottom of the jaw (mandible) forward. CT is the preferred imaging modality because it is superior at evaluating bony structures and can provide excellent three-dimensional image reconstructions of the airway and bony skeleton (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80062\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80062 \">image 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> above.)</p><p>Cephalometry is an alternative if three-dimensional CT is unavailable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, it is a second-line modality because it is two-dimensional and provides information only about anterior-posterior structures and not lateral structures. Cephalometry has successfully identified soft tissue and bony abnormalities in patients with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

We consider cephalometry for some patients prior to constructing an oral (dental) appliance. However, cephalometry is not necessary for most patients who are going to be treated with an oral appliance. In particularly complicated cases, three-dimensional CT may better evaluate relationships between the airway and bony skeleton than cephalometry. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Cephalometry'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> above.)</p><p>The role of oral appliances in the treatment of OSA is discussed in detail elsewhere.
