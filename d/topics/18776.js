It is also called an anticoagulant. Many people refer to these medicines as &quot;blood thinners,&quot; although they do not actually cause the blood to become less thick, only less likely to clot.</p><p>The normal clotting mechanism is a complex process that involves multiple substances (clotting factors). These factors are produced by the liver and act in sequence to form a blood clot. In order for the liver to produce some of the clotting factors, adequate amounts of vitamin K must be available. Warfarin blocks one of the enzymes that uses vitamin K to make some of the clotting factors, and in turn reduces their production. As a result, the clotting mechanism is disrupted and it takes longer for the blood to clot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823582\"><span class=\"h1\">WHY DO I NEED WARFARIN?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Warfarin is prescribed for people who are at increased risk for developing harmful blood clots. This includes people with a mechanical heart valve, an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, certain clotting disorders, or a higher risk of a clot after hip or knee surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-antiphospholipid-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The antiphospholipid syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Warfarin is also used in people who have already developed a harmful blood clot, including some people who have had a stroke, heart attack, a clot that has traveled to the lung (pulmonary embolism or PE), or a blood clot in the leg (deep vein thrombosis or DVT).</p><p>Warfarin does not dissolve clots, but it keeps them from increasing in size and moving to another part of the body. This allows the body's natural systems to break down a clot over time, and helps reduce the chance of clots developing in people with a higher risk of forming clots. Warfarin prevents and treats serious medical problems caused by blood clots. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Ischemic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-embolism-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pulmonary embolism (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">WARFARIN MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of warfarin therapy is to decrease the clotting tendency of blood, but not to prevent clotting completely. Therefore, the blood's ability to clot must be carefully monitored while a person takes warfarin. The dose of warfarin is adjusted to maintain the clotting time within a target range, based on the results of periodic blood tests. These tests can be done in a laboratory or using a portable device at home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Prothrombin time (PT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clotting test used to measure the effect of warfarin is the prothrombin time (called pro time, or PT). The PT is a laboratory test that measures the time it takes for a clot to form. It is measured in seconds. It is particularly sensitive to the clotting factors affected by warfarin. The PT is also used to compute the measure most commonly used to adjust the warfarin dose, known as the INR (or International Normalized Ratio).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">International Normalized Ratio (INR)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The INR is a way of expressing the PT in a standardized way by comparing it to a reference value; this ensures that results obtained by different laboratories in different facilities can be compared reliably. It is expressed as a number without units.</p><p>The longer it takes the blood to clot, the higher the PT and INR. The target INR range depends upon the clinical situation. In most cases the target INR range will be between 2 and 3, although other ranges may be chosen if there are special circumstances. In a person who is not taking warfarin, the INR would be approximately 1.</p><p>If the INR is below the target range (ie, under-anticoagulated), there is an increased risk of clotting. On the other hand, if the INR is above the target range (ie, over-anticoagulated), there is an increased risk of bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dose of warfarin is adjusted to get the <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> blood test into the correct range. The prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/international</span> normalized ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(PT/INR)</span> is monitored more often when the dose is being changed, when the person starts or stops another medication, or when his or her medical condition changes. It is monitored less often when the dose is stable. A typical frequency of monitoring for stable dosing is approximately every four or six weeks.</p><p>In addition to increased monitoring, changes in your other medications or medical condition may result in the need for a higher or lower daily warfarin dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">WARFARIN SIDE EFFECTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3084715777\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major complication associated with warfarin is bleeding. This includes serious, life-threatening bleeding such as bleeding into the brain or internal bleeding, which is rare, and minor bleeding such as easy bruising, gum bleeding, or nosebleeds, which are common and can occur with any anticoagulant.</p><p>The risk of bleeding is different in different people. Bleeding risk is greatest during the few weeks warfarin is started and during periods of illness. In general, the risk of major internal bleeding is about 1 to 3 percent per year; people who have tolerated warfarin well for at least six months and are on a stable dose of warfarin usually have a risk for major internal bleeding that is closer to 1 percent per year. Excessive bleeding, or hemorrhage, can occur from any area of the body even if the warfarin is having the desired (rather than an excessive) effect, and people on warfarin should report any falls or accidents, as well as signs or symptoms of bleeding or unusual bruising.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of internal bleeding include severe headache or changes in strength in one part of the body, blood in the urine, bloody or dark stool, or vomiting blood. These signs should prompt immediate discussion with your healthcare provider, who may order a <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> test and an in-person evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'When to seek help'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minor bleeding includes bleeding from the gums, nosebleeds, or easy bruising. It is important to report changes in the severity or frequency of these symptoms so that your healthcare provider can decide on the appropriate steps to take.</p><p/><p>Because the risk of bleeding increases as the INR rises, the INR is closely monitored and adjustments are made as needed to maintain the INR within the target range. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'International Normalized Ratio (INR)'</a> above.)</p><p>Warfarin can also cause a rare side effect called skin necrosis or gangrene, which can cause dark red or black areas on the skin. This complication is more likely in people with an inherited clotting disorder called protein C deficiency, which is very rare. When it occurs, it is most likely to be seen during the first several days of warfarin therapy.</p><p>Warfarin may cause other possible side effects. More detailed information is available in the patient drug information hand-out from Lexicomp, available through UpToDate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">When to seek help</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If there are obvious or subtle signs of bleeding, including the following, you should call your healthcare provider <strong>immediately</strong>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent nausea, stomach upset, or vomiting blood or other material that looks like coffee grounds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches, dizziness, or weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nosebleeds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dark red or brown urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in the bowel movement or dark-colored stool</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serious fall or head injury, even if there are no other symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A car accident or other serious injury that could cause bleeding</p><p/><p>It is also important to notify your healthcare provider if you have any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the gums after brushing the teeth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling or pain at an injection site</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Black and blue skin (bruising)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive menstrual bleeding or bleeding between menstrual periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea, vomiting, or inability to eat for more than 24 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (temperature greater than 100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C), which could be a sign of infection that might alter the INR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A new medication prescribed by another clinician, because some medications can alter the INR in people taking warfarin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A planned surgery or procedure, because it may be necessary to stop the warfarin for a period of time to decrease your risk of bleeding during or after the procedure</p><p/><p>It is important to remember that warfarin is taken to reduce the risk of a clotting condition(s), such as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or stroke. If you develop any symptoms of a clot, seek immediate medical attention.

Warfarin can also interfere with the formation of bone and cartilage in the developing fetus. These effects on blood clotting and development before birth can lead to birth defects and other problems. A woman who becomes pregnant while on warfarin should notify her healthcare provider immediately. A women taking warfarin who plans to become pregnant should discuss a plan of action with her healthcare provider.</p><p>Heparin or low molecular weight heparin (sample brand name: Lovenox) are anticoagulants that do not cross the placenta from mother to baby and can be used instead of warfarin during pregnancy. Warfarin can be restarted after delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although warfarin does not pass into breast milk, a woman who wishes to breastfeed while taking warfarin should consult her healthcare provider. Warfarin is considered safe for use in breastfeeding women and their infants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Take warfarin on a schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Warfarin should be taken <strong>exactly</strong> as directed. Do not increase, decrease, or change the dose unless told to do so by a healthcare provider or according to a self-monitoring protocol if you are using an international normalized ratio (INR)-monitoring device at home. If a dose is missed or forgotten, call the prescribing clinician for advice. Sometimes using a pill box (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F113044\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113044 \">picture 1</a>) or a dosing calendar can help with taking warfarin doses correctly.</p><p>Warfarin tablets come in different strengths. Each is usually a different color, with the amount of warfarin (in milligrams) clearly printed on the tablet. If the color, shape, or dose of the tablet appears different from those taken previously, you should immediately notify your pharmacist or healthcare provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduce the risk of bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a tendency to bleed more easily than usual while taking warfarin. Some simple measures can decrease this risk. Examples of common sense precautions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always use a seatbelt.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a helmet when riding a bicycle or motorcycle.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid using non-prescription medicines that contain a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (&quot;NSAID&quot;) as well as other over-the-counter remedies without discussing with your healthcare provider. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Warfarin and medications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When seeing any healthcare provider (doctor, dentist, nurse), tell them you are taking warfarin.</p><p/><p>Keep in mind that <strong>any</strong> injury you get could bleed more than normal. This includes everything from small cuts to the skin (such as nicks from a razor) to more serious injuries. To lower your risk, you can take extra care when doing things that could cause bleeding. This might include shaving with an electric razor rather than a razor blade, being careful when using knives or sharp objects, and avoiding certain contact sports with a high risk of injury. Additional measures some people take include avoiding ice and other slippery surfaces, removing tripping hazards around your home, and reducing the risk of tripping over a pet using aids such as bell collars, obedience training, and two-handed leash holds. Use your clinician as a resource to help you figure out the approaches that work best for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Warfarin and food</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some foods and supplements can interfere with warfarin's effectiveness. Consult a healthcare provider before making major dietary changes (eg, starting a diet to lose weight, starting a nutritional supplement or vitamin).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin K &ndash; Eating an increased amount of foods rich in vitamin K can lower the INR, making warfarin less effective, and potentially increasing the risk of blood clots. This does not mean you cannot eat vitamin K-containing foods. It just means that the amount of vitamin K in your diet should be relatively constant. People who take warfarin should aim to eat a relatively similar amount of vitamin K-containing foods each week. Some foods that have a high level of vitamin K include: kale, broccoli, spinach, collard or turnip greens, lettuce, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65279\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65279 \">table 1</a>). It is <strong>not</strong> necessary to avoid these foods, and the use of warfarin should not interfere with a healthy diet. The goal should be to eat a relatively similar amount on a regular basis rather than having large day-to-day variations in intake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cranberry juice and grapefruit juice &ndash; There have been mixed reports on the effect of cranberry juice or grapefruit juice in people who use warfarin to prevent blood clots. Some clinicians suggest that people taking warfarin not consume more than one or two glasses of either juice per day.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91054634\"><span class=\"h2\">Warfarin and alcohol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol in low or moderate amounts (one or two servings per day) is unlikely to have major effects on the INR. People who consume alcohol should limit intake to 1 to 2 servings per day. A serving is equal to 1 beer (12 ounces), 1 glass of wine (5 ounces), or 1.5 ounces of spirits. People on warfarin therapy should avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over a short period of time (eg, with a single meal) because this can affect the INR and increase the risk of injury and serious bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Warfarin and medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of medications, herbs, and vitamins can interact with warfarin. Interactions may change (either increase or decrease) the action of warfarin or the other medication. The warfarin dose may need to be adjusted (up or down) to maintain an optimal anticoagulant effect. Examples of these interactions are provided in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F54061\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54061 \">table 2</a>). Other medicines that are not on the table can also interact with warfarin. Any time a new medicine is started or an existing one is stopped, people taking warfarin should have their medications carefully analyzed for possible interactions. This can be done by using the Lexi-Interact drug interactions program included with UpToDate.</p><p>People who take warfarin should consult with their clinician <strong>before taking any new medication</strong>, including over-the-counter (non-prescription) drugs, herbal medicines, vitamins, supplements, or any other products. Some of the most common over-the-counter pain relievers, including those that contain aspirin or an NSAID such as ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (sample brand name: Aleve), may increase the risk of bleeding. Acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol) may interact with warfarin if taken in doses over the recommended maximum of 4000 mg per 24-hour period. If more than one or two doses of a fever reducer or over-the-counter pain medication is needed, acetaminophen is preferable to aspirin or an NSAID.</p><p>Some anticoagulation specialists recommend that people avoid taking natural medicines and herbs while on warfarin because the ingredients in these products are not standardized and their effects on INR are unpredictable. However, if you do take a natural product or herbal supplement, more frequent INR monitoring may be necessary to ensure safety. It's a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider before you try any new herbs or supplements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Wear medical identification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who require long-term warfarin should wear a bracelet, necklace, or similar alert tag at all times. In addition, a medication wallet card placed next to a driver's license or other official identification can be helpful. If an accident occurs and the person is too ill to explain their condition, this will help responders provide appropriate care.</p><p>The alert tag should include a list of major medical conditions and the reason warfarin is needed (eg, atrial fibrillation), as well as the name and phone number of an emergency contact. One device, Medic Alert, provides a toll-free number that emergency medical workers can call to find out a person's medical history, list of medications, family emergency contact numbers, and healthcare provider names and numbers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119585787\"><span class=\"h1\">CAN I SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT ANTICOAGULANT?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people who take warfarin wonder if they could switch to one of the anticoagulants that do not require regular blood test monitoring. Medicines in this group are called direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). These medications include dabigatran (brand name: Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (brand name: Xarelto), apixaban (brand name: Eliquis), edoxaban (brand names: Savaysa, Lixiana), and betrixaban (brand name: Bevyxxa) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F99882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99882 \">table 3</a>). These medicines are not monitored with regular blood tests, and in many people, they may be safer than warfarin (less risk of bleeding). However, these medicines are not the best choice for everyone. For example, warfarin is used for people with a mechanical heart valve. Every medication has risks and benefits, and the best choice for you depends on your individual situation. Ask your doctor if you have concerns or questions about which anticoagulant you should take.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=15467\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
