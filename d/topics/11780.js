This antimicrobial drug is generally used for treatment of acute cystitis and for prophylaxis in patients with recurrent UTIs. Pulmonary toxicity due to nitrofurantoin has two main presentations: an acute onset approximately nine days after a short course of therapy and a chronic onset developing after several months or years of nitrofurantoin therapy. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a> toxicity will be reviewed here.

This is related to the greater susceptibility of women to recurrent urinary tract infections, so that women are exposed to long-term nitrofurantoin more often than men. </p><p>The median age among those presenting with the acute or chronic forms of the illness is approximately 60 and 70 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitrofurantoin-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most frequently reported symptoms of an acute hypersensitivity reaction are fever, dyspnea, and an irritating cough; rash is occasionally seen. The presentation of chronic toxicity includes a more insidious onset of dyspnea, dry cough, and fatigue without fever. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory findings are generally nonspecific. Peripheral blood eosinophilia is common among patients with acute reactions. Chronic reactions can be associated with elevations in serum transaminases, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and also positive antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and rheumatoid factor tests. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of an acute reaction to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a> can be established by the combination of exposure to nitrofurantoin, the characteristic time course and pattern of symptoms, and compatible laboratory tests. Prompt resolution following discontinuation of nitrofurantoin further supports the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of chronic pulmonary toxicity is based on the history of long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a> therapy, the absence of another explanation for the patient&rsquo;s symptoms and radiographic abnormalities, and response to drug cessation.
