Pertussis is spread by respiratory droplets. The risk of transmission is greatest during the catarrhal stage. The average incubation period is 7 to 10 days (range 6 to 20 days). (See <a href=\"#H258609744\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic pertussis typically occurs in unvaccinated children. It has three stages: a catarrhal stage that lasts one to two weeks and is similar to an upper respiratory infection; a paroxysmal stage that lasts two to eight weeks and is characterized by paroxysms of coughing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80861\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80861 \">movie 1</a>), an inspiratory whoop (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57822\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef57822 \">movie 2</a>), and posttussive vomiting; and a convalescent stage, during which the cough subsides over several weeks to months.
