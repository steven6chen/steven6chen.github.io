Of the remaining five pregnancies, three ended in miscarriage, one had an elective termination due to fetal anomalies, and one was associated with recurrent VTE, possibly due to underdosing. One of the adverse outcomes may have been related to a delay in delivery due to lack of experience with fondaparinux management, which emphasizes the importance of having a clear delivery plan.

For such patients, we recommend low molecular weight (LMW) heparin rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> for all but the final weeks of the pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This is based on the ease of administration of LMW heparin compared with unfractionated heparin. Unfractionated heparin is a reasonable alternative when cost or need for rapid reversal is important, and it is the preferred agent for patients with severe renal insufficiency (eg, creatinine clearance &le;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> and for all patients in preparation for labor and delivery. (See <a href=\"#H5711523\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anticoagulant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The choice of anticoagulant in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-for-a-prosthetic-heart-valve-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of antithrombotic therapy for a prosthetic heart valve during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LMW heparin can be administered at different doses depending upon the risk of thromboembolism and desired degree of anticoagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69149\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69149 \">table 2</a>). The general terms &quot;therapeutic dose&quot; and &quot;prophylactic dose&quot; are used to convey the intensity of anticoagulation and vary depending upon the agent used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91838 \">table 3</a>). It is important to use preservative-free preparations. We obtain a baseline creatinine level and platelet count prior to initiating LMW or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, and monitor platelet counts during heparin administration. (See <a href=\"#H12049167\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Choice of the appropriate dosing level is discussed in separate topic reviews on indications for anticoagulation:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inherited thrombophilia &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy#H7898355\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Prevention of VTE'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prior venous thromboembolism &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-prevention#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in pregnancy: Prevention&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding is a risk with any anticoagulant. Management of bleeding depends on the degree and site of bleeding, and the original indication for anticoagulation, and decisions regarding discontinuation and reversal of anticoagulants are made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with a hematologist and other specialists. (See <a href=\"#H155857\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of thrombosis and bleeding'</a> above and <a href=\"#H157293\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of bleeding on heparin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse reaction to heparin; the incidence of HIT during pregnancy is very low. We monitor for HIT by assessing the patient's platelet count periodically during LMW or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> administration. Patients with suspected HIT should have an immediate assessment of clinical parameters (eg, platelet count, presence of thrombosis or skin changes); for those considered to a high likelihood of HIT, an alternate anticoagulant should be substituted and laboratory testing for HIT should be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H155965\" class=\"local\">'Suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H83672397\" class=\"local\">'HIT during or immediately preceding pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulation during labor should be avoided; most obstetricians replace therapeutic dose LMW heparin with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> at 36 to 37 weeks of gestation to reduce the risk of bleeding associated with delivery. An exception is women with mechanical heart valves, for whom the switch to unfractionated heparin generally is made later. (See <a href=\"#H148919\" class=\"local\">'Switch to unfractionated heparin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A catheter for neuraxial anesthesia cannot be inserted if a patient is anticoagulated. The length of time without anticoagulation prior to neuraxial anesthesia depends upon the agent and dose used. (See <a href=\"#H148925\" class=\"local\">'Neuraxial anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulation is reinstituted following delivery in most patients who were receiving an anticoagulant during pregnancy; additional patients may initiate anticoagulation postpartum for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. Unfractionated or LMW heparin can be resumed at prophylactic doses as early as four to six hours after vaginal delivery and 6 to 12 hours after cesarean delivery unless there was significant bleeding, although for most patients we wait 6 to 12 hours after vaginal delivery and 12 to 24 hours after cesarean. Many anticoagulants (eg, heparins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) can be used during breastfeeding because they do not accumulate in breast milk. (See <a href=\"#H14756127\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum and breastfeeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women receiving chronic anticoagulation who are contemplating pregnancy need counseling regarding avoidance of the potential teratogenic effects of oral anticoagulants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>). Warfarin, oral direct thrombin inhibitors, and factor Xa inhibitors should not be continued during the first trimester, and a switch should be made to LMW heparin either before attempted conception or immediately upon confirmation of pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H5531900\" class=\"local\">'Women on warfarin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19337422\" class=\"local\">'Women on direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14757002\" class=\"local\">'When to start LMW heparin'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-anticoagulants-during-pregnancy-and-postpartum/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Forestier F, Daffos F, Capella-Pavlovsky M.
