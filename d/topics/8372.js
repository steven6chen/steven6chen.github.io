The fall in serum calcium is primarily due to functional or relative hypoparathyroidism, leading to reductions in bone reabsorption and increases in bone formation, leading to an increased influx of calcium into bone and, in patients without end-stage renal disease, increased calcium excretion and decreased intestinal calcium absorption due to reduced parathyroid hormone (PTH)-mediated renal 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D) production. A less frequent contributing factor is acute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> release from the thyroid gland.</p><p>The hypocalcemia is generally transient because the degree of bone disease is typically mild and normal parathyroid tissue recovers function quickly (usually within one week), even after long-term suppression.</p><p>In some cases, however, the postoperative hypocalcemia is severe and prolonged, despite normal or even elevated levels of PTH. This phenomenon, called the <strong>hungry bone</strong> syndrome, most often occurs in patients who have developed bone disease preoperatively due to a chronic increase in bone resorption induced by high levels of PTH (osteitis fibrosa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The underlying hyperparathyroidism can either be primary or secondary due to end-stage renal disease. In addition to parathyroidectomy, a less severe hypocalcemic syndrome can occur in patients with end-stage renal disease who are treated with calcimimetics, which reduce PTH secretion by modulating the calcium-sensing receptor in the parathyroid glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Refractory hyperparathyroidism and indications for parathyroidectomy in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to reduced serum calcium, reduced serum phosphate and increased serum potassium levels may be observed in hungry bone syndrome. The decreased serum calcium and phosphate and increased potassium likely reflect increased bone influx and efflux, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>Hungry bone syndrome has also been described after thyroidectomy in patients with hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In such patients, the preoperative bone disease is due to high bone turnover induced by excess thyroid hormone. A less common cause is estrogen therapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The postoperative hypocalcemia probably results from acute reversal of the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-induced contribution of bone to maintenance of the serum calcium concentration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67512 \">figure 1</a>). In the high turnover state associated with hyperparathyroidism, PTH increases bone formation and resorption with a net efflux of calcium from bone. Sudden withdrawal of PTH in such patients causes an imbalance between osteoblast-mediated bone formation and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and perhaps other changes affecting calcium fluxes, leading to a marked net increase in bone uptake of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, the hungry bone syndrome requires an abrupt decrease in PTH release that upsets the equilibrium between calcium efflux from bone and influx into the skeleton during bone remodeling.</p><p>Similar mechanisms may be responsible for the hypocalcemia occasionally seen in patients with metastatic prostate cancer who have been treated with estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The osteoblastic metastases act as a calcium sink, and bone resorption increases to maintain the serum calcium concentration. Inhibition of bone resorption with estrogen unmasks the underlying elevation in bone calcium uptake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lack of well-defined clinical criteria for the diagnosis of the hungry bone syndrome makes it difficult to determine its true incidence. In a report of 198 patients who underwent parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism, the syndrome was considered present if the serum calcium concentration was below 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and the serum phosphate concentration was below 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.96 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> on the third postoperative day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thirteen percent of the patients fulfilled these criteria, with a mean serum calcium of 8.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and a mean serum phosphate concentration of 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p>The incidence of hungry bone syndrome following parathyroidectomy in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to end-stage renal disease has not been carefully examined. In one study of 148 dialysis patients who underwent parathyroidectomy, hungry bone syndrome occurred in 20 percent, which was associated with a prolonged hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The postoperative fall in serum calcium has been correlated with the severity of bone disease seen on preoperative bone biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of hungry bone syndrome are largely due to hypocalcemia and, to a lesser degree, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperkalemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypocalcemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypocalcemia, with or without its accompanying signs and symptoms, usually dominates the clinical picture. The serum calcium typically reaches a nadir two to four days postoperatively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67512 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Tetany and seizures can occur, possibly leading to major bone fractures. Overt heart failure has also been described in patients with latent myocardial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]; in these cases, cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion resolved after normalization of the serum calcium. The duration of hypocalcemia is variable and may last up to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypophosphatemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decrease in bone resorption and increase in bone formation that occurs after parathyroidectomy can also lead to hypophosphatemia. This primarily occurs in patients with primary rather than secondary hyperparathyroidism. In the latter disorder, the serum phosphorus falls from an initially high level to one that is usually still above the normal range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F72139\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72139 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypomagnesemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypomagnesemia is also more prevalent among patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism. The recognition and treatment of magnesium deficiency is important since hypomagnesemia can contribute to the development of refractory hypocalcemia by diminishing parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and inducing PTH resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-magnesium-depletion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of magnesium depletion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperkalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperkalemia occurs in up to 80 percent of dialysis patients undergoing parathyroidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The pathophysiology underlying this phenomenon is currently unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is aimed at each of the abnormalities that can occur: hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyperkalemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypocalcemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful monitoring is required to prevent and treat symptomatic hypocalcemia, which can be potentially catastrophic. Thus, the serum calcium concentration should be measured two to four times per day for the first few postoperative days, the time of greatest risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67512 \">figure 1</a>). The measurement of ionized calcium is preferred to total serum calcium since the total serum calcium concentration may not reliably predict the ionized calcium concentration, especially among patients with chronic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=relation-between-total-and-ionized-serum-calcium-concentrations#H701808710\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Relation between total and ionized serum calcium concentrations&quot;, section on 'Measuring the serum calcium in patients with CKD'</a>.)</p><p>Oral calcium supplementation (2 to 4 g of elemental calcium [50 to 100 mmol] per day) should be started as soon as the patient is able to swallow. If the serum phosphorus is normal or low, calcium should be administered between meals to maximize intestinal absorption and minimize phosphate binding.</p><p>Intravenous calcium is indicated if the patient develops a rapid and progressive reduction in serum calcium or symptoms related to hypocalcemia, including frank or latent tetany (Chvostek's or Trousseau's sign), seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, laryngeal spasm, or either an ionized calcium concentration below 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> or total serum calcium below 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> all which can be life-threatening.<br/></p><p>Initially, intravenous calcium (1 to 2 g of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a>, equivalent to 90 to 180 mg elemental calcium, in 50 mL of 5 percent dextrose) can be infused over 10 to 20 minutes. The calcium should not be given more rapidly, because of the risk of serious cardiac dysfunction, including systolic arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This dose of calcium gluconate will raise the serum calcium concentration for only two or three hours; as a result, it should be followed by a slow infusion of calcium in patients with persistent hypocalcemia.</p><p>Either 10 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> (90 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) or 10 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a> (270 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) can be used to prepare the infusion solution. Calcium gluconate is usually preferred because it is less likely to cause tissue necrosis if extravasated. Local vein irritation can occur with calcium solutions &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.</p><p>An intravenous solution containing approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> of elemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> is prepared by adding 100 mL of 10 percent calcium gluconate (90 mg elemental calcium per 10 mL for a total of 900 mg elemental calcium) to 1000 mL of 5 percent dextrose in water. This solution is administered at an initial infusion rate of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> (equivalent to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour)</span>. The dose can be adjusted to maintain the ionized calcium concentration at the lower end of the normal range (4.0 to 5.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1.1 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. Patients typically require 0.5 to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of elemental calcium per hour.</p><p>The infusion should be prepared with the following considerations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The calcium should be diluted in dextrose and water or saline because concentrated calcium solutions are irritating to veins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intravenous solution should not contain bicarbonate or phosphate, which can form insoluble calcium salts. If these anions are needed, another intravenous line (in another limb) should be used.</p><p/><p>Vitamin D supplementation is also useful, particularly in patients on maintenance dialysis who are often vitamin D deficient if they have not been receiving some form of replacement therapy. In a placebo-controlled trial, for example, postoperative oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> in doses up to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> ameliorated the postoperative decline in the serum calcium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no studies comparing the relative efficacy of oral and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> administration. It is common practice to administer calcitriol intravenously at increased doses. The only concern with the use of high-dose calcitriol is the potential to suppress the function and engraftment of autotransplanted parathyroid tissue. We give intravenous calcitriol to all patients who are hypocalcemic following parathyroidectomy. Intravenous calcitriol is generally continued until the serum calcium has stabilized at a clinically safe concentration. Once the serum calcium is stable, the patient may be switched to oral calcitriol, which is continued until the serum calcium concentration is normal (usually two to four weeks).</p><p>Dialysis is another method of correcting the hypocalcemia. A high-calcium bath (3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [1.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> can be used in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Alternatively, intravenous calcium can be administered during dialysis, thereby allowing an earlier switch to outpatient management. Similarly, one to three ampules of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> can be added to each bag of peritoneal dialysate in patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum magnesium and phosphate concentrations should also be monitored since significant hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia can occur in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. The hypomagnesemia can contribute to the development of refractory hypocalcemia by diminishing parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and inducing PTH resistance (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-magnesium-depletion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of magnesium depletion&quot;</a>). Thus, raising the serum magnesium concentration may contribute to correction of the hypocalcemia.</p><p>In contrast, the administration of phosphate to reverse hypophosphatemia is generally avoided in patients with hungry bone syndrome since phosphate can combine with calcium and further reduce the plasma calcium concentration. Exceptions may be made for patients who have extremely low serum phosphate concentrations (ie, less than 0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [0.16 to 032 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> in the setting of symptoms of hypophosphatemia such as severe muscle weakness or heart failure. Even under such circumstances, the administration of phosphate should be considered potentially hazardous because of the rapidity with which symptoms of resulting hypocalcemia may develop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypophosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypophosphatemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Different changes in phosphate balance occur after parathyroidectomy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who do not have significant bone disease. These patients do not develop hungry bone syndrome and may have a rise in the plasma phosphate concentration due to reversal of PTH-induced phosphate loss in the urine.</p><p>Clinically significant hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia are uncommon in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing parathyroidectomy. Serum phosphate values are typically elevated and fall toward the normal range after surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F72139\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72139 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperkalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum potassium concentration should be closely followed in patients with end-stage renal disease. Such patients should be dialyzed on the first or second postoperative day, preferably with a no-heparin protocol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in the hemodialysis population, most physicians recommend preoperative administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> to all such patients, if they are not already being treated with a vitamin D metabolite. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-in-adult-nondialysis-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adult nondialysis patients with chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> (2 mcg at the end of each hemodialysis treatment) begun three to five days prior to surgery and continued postoperatively may be helpful in preventing marked hypocalcemia. This regimen may also suppress bone remodeling and increase absorption of oral calcium, both of which can minimize the need for intravenous calcium postoperatively. Intravenous calcitriol is generally continued until the serum calcium has stabilized at a clinically safe concentration. Once the serum calcium is stable, the patient may be switched to oral calcitriol, which is continued until the serum calcium concentration is normal (usually two to four weeks). Some authors also suggest starting oral calcium 2 to 3 grams per day two days prior to surgery, even in patients who are hypercalcemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].<br/><br/>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> (alone or in combination with calcitriol) to suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and lower bone remodeling may attenuate the severity of hungry bone syndrome, but additional experience with this treatment is necessary before this is recommended.<br/></p><p>A few case reports and several retrospective studies have suggested a possible role for the preoperative administration of bisphosphonates as another preventive measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In these reports, bisphosphonates were used to treat hypercalcemia in patients with severe primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism prior to parathyroidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Since bisphosphonates can reduce serum calcium levels, these anecdotal and apparently paradoxical observations require confirmation with a controlled, randomized study. The fact that these patients did not develop postoperative hypocalcemia does <strong>not</strong> constitute enough evidence to justify the use of bisphosphonates prior to parathyroidectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H512439998\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hungry bone syndrome refers to severe and prolonged hypocalcemia, which occurs after parathyroidectomy or less commonly, thyroidectomy, despite normal or even elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH).

The patient may be dialyzed against a high-calcium bath (3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [1.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> or intravenous calcium can be administered during dialysis.<br/><br/>For patients who are on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, one to three ampules of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> can be added to each bag of peritoneal dialysate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum phosphate and magnesium concentrations should be closely followed after parathyroidectomy. The correction of hypomagnesemia may contribute to correction of the hypocalcemia. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The administration of phosphate to reverse hypophosphatemia is generally avoided in patients with hungry bone syndrome since phosphate can combine with calcium and further reduce the plasma calcium concentration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypophosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypophosphatemia&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>The serum potassium concentration should be closely followed in patients with end-stage renal disease. Such patients should be dialyzed on the first or second postoperative day, preferably with a no-heparin protocol. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Hyperkalemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For prevention of hungry bone syndrome, most physicians recommend preoperative administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> to all such patients if they are not already being treated with a vitamin D metabolite. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Intravenous calcitriol (2 mcg at the end of each hemodialysis treatment), begun three to five days prior to surgery and continued postoperatively, may be helpful in preventing marked hypocalcemia. This regimen may also suppress bone remodeling and increase absorption of oral calcium, both of which can minimize the need for intravenous calcium postoperatively. Some authors also suggest starting oral calcium 2 to 3 grams per day two days prior to surgery, even in patients who are hypercalcemic.<br/><br/>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> (alone or in combination with calcitriol) to suppress PTH levels and lower bone remodeling may attenuate the severity of hungry bone syndrome, but additional experience with this treatment is necessary before this is recommended.
