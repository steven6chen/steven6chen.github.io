It emerged at the same time as glucocorticoids, however, and received little attention in the therapy of rheumatic diseases until retrospective reports appeared in the early 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Short-term placebo-controlled prospective studies in the mid-1980s demonstrated its potent efficacy and superiority to placebo in patients with chronic severe RA, and long-term open prospective studies then showed that the response was sustained and that toxicity was manageable. These insights have led to the metamorphosis of MTX into its present status as the dominant slow-acting drug to treat patients with RA.</p><p>The pharmacology of MTX and its use in the treatment of RA will be reviewed here. MTX has also been used effectively in a variety of other mostly rheumatic diseases including ankylosing spondylitis, Felty's syndrome, inclusion body myositis, reactive arthritis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's). These disorders, as well as the major side effects of MTX, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of low-dose methotrexate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatotoxicity associated with chronic low-dose methotrexate for nonmalignant disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> (MTX) can be given by oral, intramuscular, and subcutaneous routes. Oral MTX is variably absorbed in the dose range used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Serum levels of MTX consistently increase when the drug is administered parenterally, which is not the case for oral ingestion of doses of 15 mg or greater administered all at one time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. This difference in absorption may have therapeutic implications, as some patients may respond better to parenteral therapy, presumably because more drug reaches the circulation (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Parenteral therapy'</a> below). This difference in drug levels between parenteral and oral administration may be more pronounced at higher doses within the usual therapeutic range.</p><p>As an example, a 7.5 mg weekly dose is absorbed better than a 15 to 20 mg dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Bioavailability (f) is defined as the ratio of oral drug absorption divided by intravenous drug absorption. Since f may drop off by a mean of 13.5 percent as the dose of MTX is increased from a starting dose of 7.5 mg to the typical maintenance weekly doses employed in RA, a patient may do better clinically when switched from oral (PO) to intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) administration of the same dose of the drug (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Parenteral therapy'</a> below). At a 17.5 to 20 mg weekly dose of MTX, for example, a 13.5 percent difference in f between the PO and IM routes of administration is equivalent to one full 2.5 mg MTX tablet. As the variation in the confidence intervals for the drop-off in f extends to 27 percent, selected patients may have an even greater difference in f between parenteral and oral dosing.</p><p>At higher doses, decreased bioavailability may be even more pronounced. This was illustrated in a pharmacokinetic analysis of 15 patients taking more than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> of MTX (mean of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week);</span> the ratio of oral to subcutaneous absorption was decreased by approximately one-third [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>MTX is primarily cleared via the kidneys, with 80 to 90 percent being excreted remaining unchanged in the urine. Thus, any impairment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) will result in sustained serum levels of the drug that may induce bone marrow or other toxicities. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may decrease the renal excretion of MTX; however, a systematic review of randomized trials and large studies involving patients with RA found that NSAIDs could be safely given together with MTX, assuming that appropriate monitoring for drug toxicity is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The use of antiinflammatory doses of salicylates with MTX should be avoided, although lower doses are easily tolerated and should not be a problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Food does not affect MTX absorption to a significant degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It may, therefore, be given with a meal or in the fasting state. In addition, MTX has minimal interaction with other drugs as only 50 percent is protein bound. However, there is the risk of increased toxicity when combined with other folate-depleting drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">probenecid</a>. MTX appears to be well tolerated in patients taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (usually as one double-strength tablet three times weekly, such as on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday regimen), but this combination should be avoided when it is used in a twice-daily regimen for treatment of an active infection. Significant bone marrow and other toxicities have been observed with use of a daily sulfa antibiotic regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MTX is a structural analogue of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> that can competitively inhibit the binding of dihydrofolic acid (FH2) to the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR is responsible for reducing FH2 to folinic acid (5-formyl tetrahydrofolate [FH4]; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a>), the active intracellular metabolite. Thus, MTX decreases the amount of intracellular FH4 available and affects the metabolic pathways within the cell that are FH4 dependent. These pathways include purine and pyrimidine metabolism, as well as amino acid and polyamine synthesis.</p><p>MTX is a prodrug that becomes active only when polyglutamated within cells. The process of polyglutamation is slow and takes as long as 27.5 weeks to reach steady state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This delay in steady-state polyglutamation explains the time to achievement of the plateau effect of clinical response previously described with MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Despite an understanding of the cellular action of MTX, the mechanism by which it improves the signs and symptoms of RA is not certain. One possibility is enhanced extracellular concentrations of adenosine, an autocoid with robust antiinflammatory activity, due to the extracellular dephosphorylation of adenine nucleotides via ecto-5'-nucleotidase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Supporting evidence of a role for adenosine includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The demonstration in animals that the nonspecific adenosine receptor antagonists, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> and caffeine, reduce the beneficial effects of MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There is no evidence of an antagonistic effect of caffeine or theophylline in humans treated with MTX, although the possibility of an interaction is intriguing and deserves study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rodents that lack adenosine receptors do not have the same antiinflammatory effect from MTX as animals with these adenosine receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The observation of an association between certain allelic variants of enzymes involved in the metabolism of adenosine and clinical response of patients with early RA to MTX therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>Other mechanisms may include the inhibition of methylation reactions vital for cellular activities and replication, clonal deletion via apoptosis of activated peripheral T cells, decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines by activated T cells, suppression of interleukin (IL)-1 beta production by mononuclear cells, repression of the clonal growth of peripheral and synovial T and B cells, increased production of IL-10, and suppression of intracellular adhesion by activated T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. The question of how the drug works is made even more difficult by the fact that MTX may also bind directly to other folate-dependent enzymes, including those which are integral to purine biosynthesis. MTX has also been shown to significantly decrease circulating IL-6 in patients treated for RA. These observations were made over a period of 36 months and correlated well with simultaneous pharmacokinetic measures of MTX metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">USE IN PATIENTS WITH RA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> (MTX) is commonly used for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The use of MTX in RA is also associated with a beneficial effect on survival. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Possible survival benefit'</a> below.)</p><p>Healing of erosive disease has been observed with MTX, but the magnitude of the response is inferior to that observed with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibition. There is substantial evidence of clinical benefit, which is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy for arthritis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy for arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The short-term efficacy of MTX in the treatment of RA was initially demonstrated in a few small, randomized, placebo-controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. These findings have since been documented further in a 2014 systematic review of seven trials that updated an earlier more limited analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The longer-term efficacy was subsequently evaluated in a number of observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-32</a>]. The following illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2014 systematic review of seven randomized and controlled trials involving 732 patients showed that MTX (doses ranging from 5 to 25 mg weekly) was significantly more likely compared with placebo to result in clinically and statistically significant short-term (12 to 52 weeks) clinical improvement in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. No significant differences were found in mean radiographic scores between the groups, but MTX-treated patients were significantly less likely to exhibit radiographic progression (increase in erosion scores of &gt;3 units on a scale of 0 to 448) (relative risk [RR] 0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.86). Use of MTX was associated with a significantly greater discontinuation rate due to adverse events during the trials (16 versus 8 percent, RR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.3).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective multicenter study evaluated the effectiveness of MTX over a five-year period in 123 patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. When compared with the assessment at study entry, MTX was associated with significant improvement in all clinical disease variables (such as joint <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/tenderness</span> and joint swelling index), measures of functional status, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An 84-month prospective study of 26 patients demonstrated that the benefit continued beyond the short-term; significant improvement in joint symptoms in this cohort was still present after 36 months of therapy with weekly MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Of the 12 patients remaining in the study at the 84-month visit, there were persistent reductions in the number of painful joints, the number of swollen joints, joint pain index, joint swelling index, and physician and patient global assessments. A significant reduction in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose was also achieved in the 14 patients taking prednisone at study entry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ten patients withdrew from the study between 0 and 36 months, and four patients between 36 and 84 months. Drug toxicity required discontinuation in 11.5 percent.</p><p/><p>Not all studies have found consistent long-term radiographic benefits with MTX. In one study, 271 patients with RA in whom another DMARD was ineffective were treated with MTX and followed for periods of up to 108 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Although improvement was observed in the affected joint count and the ESR, the assessment of joint radiographs via the Larsen score revealed progressive disease despite continued therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible survival benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have suggested that MTX use is associated with reduced mortality. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort study of 1240 patients with RA at one clinical center in North America addressed the question of a possible survival benefit among those treated with MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. During follow-up, 191 patients died. MTX was prescribed for 588 patients; treatment decisions were not made in a randomized fashion. The group that received MTX had poorer prognostic indicators and more frequent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> use than the MTX-na&iuml;ve group (37 versus 22 percent, respectively). Approximately 70 percent of both groups were women, and the average age was 57 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After adjustment for possible confounding factors including age, gender, marital status, disease duration, body mass index, disability score, blood pressure, presence of absence of diabetes, and use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, the hazard ratio for all cause mortality among MTX treated patients was 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.8). When deaths were divided into those due to cardiovascular disease and other causes, the hazard ratios were 0.3 and 0.6, respectively. The reduction in cardiovascular risk was statistically significant, while that of non-cardiovascular mortality was not. The patients in this study were treated beginning in the 1980s and 1990s, prior to the general availability of anticytokine therapy. Use of traditional DMARDs other than MTX did not appear to have a similar survival advantage (hazard ratio 1.0).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved survival with MTX was also found in a study involving 5,626 patients from 10 large North American practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Patients were followed with mailed questionnaires. A total of 666 patients (12 percent) died during follow-up (median 4.2 years, interquartile range 1.7-9.6 years, and total observation period of 40.772 patient-years). Propensity-matching for MTX use was used to constitute comparable groups for analysis. The use of MTX was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.09-1.03). Only MTX use for greater than one year was associated with lower risk of mortality.</p><p/><p>It is possible that MTX may achieve an anti-atherogenic effect by improving the efficiency of reverse cholesterol transport from foam cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], although both total cholesterol and LDL do increase in patients starting MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The issue of patient selection for a slow-acting drug, such as MTX, is always difficult and is highly dependent upon the dialogue between the patient and a clinician experienced with the many complexities of the drug and the RA disease process. There is no right or wrong approach; a level of comfort on the part of all participants ultimately determines drug choice. MTX should NOT be used in women who are contemplating becoming pregnant or are pregnant. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>MTX was initially studied in RA patients who failed prior DMARDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/25,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27-30</a>]. However, an argument can be made for using MTX in all patients requiring therapy beyond nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) based upon the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall effectiveness of MTX in the treatment of RA</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The demonstration that it is best to treat early in order to avoid radiographic destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The finding that hepatic toxicity associated with MTX can be avoided by monitoring blood tests at regular intervals (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatotoxicity associated with chronic low-dose methotrexate for nonmalignant disease&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increased mortality associated with RA (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease outcome and functional capacity in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Mortality'</a>)</p><p/><p>On the other hand, some clinicians point to the disquieting reports of lymphoma while on MTX therapy and the pulmonary toxicity associated with this drug and would rather not trade a &quot;known&quot; problem (eg, RA) for an &quot;unknown&quot; one. Despite such concerns, consensus treatment recommendations developed by the American College of Rheumatology and by the European League against Rheumatism advocate treating most patients with moderate or severe disease initially with MTX, unless there is a contraindication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

However, considering the overall weight of evidence, it is our practice to use MTX more often than not in patients who do not respond to NSAID therapy. In most patients, particularly those with moderate to severe disease, MTX may be initiated at the same time as NSAID therapy.</p><p>The effect of MTX in the dose range used to treat RA patients on the effectiveness of immunizations is unknown. Thus, patients with RA who are about to be treated with MTX should, if not previously given, be immunized with diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT) vaccine, killed polio vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis B, but not measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, oral (live) polio vaccine, or yellow fever. Furthermore, nonimmunized patients should avoid contact with household contacts who are receiving live polio vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Alcohol use and MTX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drinking alcoholic beverages while using low-dose MTX is discouraged because of the risk of hepatotoxicity. Abstinence may be the best approach, but minimal intermittent alcohol intake may be tolerated. Patients who drink alcoholic beverages regularly and are unwilling to stop or to agree to only imbibe occasionally should be treated cautiously and followed for abnormalities of transaminase enzymes or serum albumin concentrations at six- to eight-week intervals. It is likely that the tolerance for alcohol while on MTX is highly variable, but there is no reliable mechanism to predict this with certainty. Alcohol intake of up to a few drinks per week is probably appropriate initially, as long as the transaminase enzymes and serum albumin are monitored at appropriate intervals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatotoxicity associated with chronic low-dose methotrexate for nonmalignant disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing of MTX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dose at which MTX was initiated for the treatment of RA in all of the early randomized trials and which was used historically in clinical practice was usually 7.5 mg per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/25,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28,29</a>]. It has become common with greater experience with MTX to use a higher starting dose, and some rheumatologists begin patients with normal renal function at a dose of as much as 12.5 or 15 mg weekly.</p><p>Patients who start with a higher weekly dose will achieve steady state concentrations of MTX polyglutamates more quickly and thus achieve better disease control more rapidly than patients who are treated with more gradual incremental increases of their weekly dose. However, patients starting at a higher weekly dose are more likely to experience an initial toxicity such as stomatitis, nausea, gastrointestinal intolerance, or fatigue.</p><p>There is no universally accepted method to determine which of several folate enzymes might predict toxicity to MTX prior to initial dosing, although several publications have pointed to an association of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms with toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. MTHFR regenerates reduced folate species intracellularly; the MTX effect on this enzyme system is associated with increased cellular toxicity and the potential for hyperhomocysteinemia.</p><p>Although low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> is not nephrotoxic, excretion is almost exclusively via the kidneys. Thus, it is prudent to monitor renal function and to reduce the dose, or discontinue the drug, if renal insufficiency develops.</p><p>MTX use in RA is contraindicated if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Among patients with an eGFR of 30 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> a lower initial dose is warranted, and a more gradual dose increase, close monitoring, and a lower maximum weekly dose should be considered. There are no data to support a particular dose adjustment regimen, and caution is warranted when starting MTX in patients with moderate compromise in renal function. In such patients, we usually do not administer doses greater than 7.5 to 10 mg once weekly.

We suggest initiating therapy at a dose between 7.5 and 15 mg once weekly for most patients, depending upon the degree of disease activity, size, and age of the patient, the presence of comorbidities, and renal function. As examples, we would treat a 70-year-old patient weighing 55 kg with moderately active disease with an initial dose of 7.5 mg once weekly, while an otherwise healthy 30-year-old patient weighing 80 kg with highly active disease would be started on 15 mg once weekly.</p><p>The MTX dose is increased as tolerated and as needed to control symptoms and signs of arthritis. Our usual approach is to increase the dose after four weeks at a rate of 2.5 mg (one <span class=\"nowrap\">tablet)/week</span> as indicated by disease activity and as tolerated. In patients with continued high disease activity, we may increase by up to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> if few comorbidities are present and if the increase in the dose continues to be well-tolerated.

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Parenteral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>An alternative approach to switching to parenteral MTX is splitting the oral dose, giving it every 12 hours on the same day each week. In this manner, a dose of oral MTX which would have decreased bioavailability could be split into two lesser doses, each with improved bioavailability. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Split dosing'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients should be monitored for efficacy and side effects of therapy at four- to eight-week intervals, and it is advisable to see patients every four weeks initially. Efficacy should be monitored by joint counts, improvement in functional status, and periodic joint radiographs every one to two years. Potential MTX toxicity is monitored with complete blood counts, chemistry profiles, and careful questioning about pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or central nervous system problems.

However, this schedule was developed by dermatologists to suppress rapidly dividing cells in psoriatic skin and has questionable rationale in the treatment of rheumatic diseases.</p><p>However, as noted above, split dosing of oral MTX has the advantage of improved bioavailability and is thus more likely to result in a commensurate clinical improvement in clinical effects. However, this hypothesis has not been formally studied in prospective investigations. Furthermore, no trials have directly compared toxicity in patients taking the drug all at once versus split dosing, and neither approach is clearly wrong. There are patients who seem to tolerate the drug better when given in divided dose regimens. The reasons for this are unclear, but split dosing may be reserved for these individuals. Daily MTX or dosing schedules which provide for administration of the MTX dose on two to four days over the course of a week are significantly <strong>more toxic</strong> and should never be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Parenteral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients prefer oral over parenteral therapy, although some practitioners believe that certain gastrointestinal toxicities may be avoided by administering MTX either subcutaneously or intramuscularly.

At week 16, a statistically significant greater proportion of patients receiving MTX by subcutaneous administration achieved American College of Rheumatology criteria for 20 percent improvement (ACR20) (85 versus 77 percent), and a switch from oral to subcutaneous administration in those oral MTX patients who had not achieved an ACR20 at week 16 resulted at week 24 in an ACR20 response in 30 percent of the previous ACR20 non-responders (9 of 30 patients).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefit from switching to parenteral administration was also seen in one arm of a trial evaluating treatment strategies for RA, in which a reduction in disease activity was observed in patients previously unable to achieve remission on maximally tolerated oral doses of MTX (of up to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week),</span> who were switched to subcutaneous administration of their dose. Similar improvement was seen in patients who were switched due to either insufficient efficacy or adverse effects, but no control group was available for comparison [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p>These findings are consistent with observations demonstrating increased levels of drug with parenteral rather than oral administration, especially at doses of 15 mg or greater weekly.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MTX is a structural analogue of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> that can competitively inhibit the binding of dihydrofolic acid (FH2) to the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is responsible for reducing FH2 to folinic acid (FH4; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a>), the active intracellular metabolite. Thus, MTX decreases the amount of intracellular FH4 available and affects the metabolic pathways within the cell that are FH4 dependent. However, the mechanism by which it improves the signs and symptoms of RA is likely to be complex. Potential mechanisms of action also include enhancement of extracellular concentrations of adenosine. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of MTX in RA improves short- and long-term clinical outcomes, and it appears to reduce joint damage and improve long-term survival. We initiate treatment in patients with moderate to severe RA using MTX together with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and use it in patients who have not responded to other therapies, such as NSAIDs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ). Appropriate immunizations should be performed prior to starting MTX. MTX should NOT be used in women who are contemplating becoming pregnant or who are pregnant, or in patients with liver disease or excessive alcohol intake. We prefer that patients agree to limit their alcohol consumption while receiving MTX. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Use in patients with RA'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy for arthritis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Possible survival benefit'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Alcohol use and MTX'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally initiate therapy with a dose between 7.5 and 15 mg weekly, depending upon the patient's age, size, comorbidities, and degree of disease activity. Higher dose initiation is more likely to achieve steady-state intracellular concentrations of MTX polyglutamates more rapidly, but there may be a tradeoff with an initial experience of more commonly experienced nuisance toxicities such as stomatitis and nausea. We usually increase the dose after the first month of therapy, depending upon the clinical response, tolerability, and the factors noted above by 2.5 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span>. The maximum dose we generally employ is approximately 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients in whom 15 to 25 mg once weekly is ineffective or poorly tolerated, a trial of subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> administration is an alternative, along with splitting the oral dose into two doses 12 hours apart and giving it all on the same day. Daily MTX or dosing schedules that require administration of the drug on two to four days over the course of a week are significantly <strong>more toxic</strong> and should never be used. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Dosing of MTX'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Dose titration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Split dosing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Parenteral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients receiving MTX should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> 1 mg daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> weekly (racemic leucovorin 2.5 mg to 5 mg or L-isomer of leucovorin 1 to 2 mg) to prevent hematologic and other side effects. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Folic acid supplementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with RA who require treatment with MTX should generally be treated indefinitely, since complete withdrawal of MTX usually leads to a flare of RA within three to six weeks and since this approach is effective and safe. In patients with well-controlled disease on 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week,</span> we reduce the dose by 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> every one to two months to a dose of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week,</span> as tolerated, while carefully monitoring for a possible flare in disease activity. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not respond to MTX alone may improve with combinations of MTX and other drugs, including both nonbiologic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Combination with other drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no clear guidelines for treatment of the non-joint manifestations of RA with MTX. Subcutaneous nodules worsen in many patients who receive the drug. In patients with underlying lung disease, MTX should probably be avoided in view of its potential to cause interstitial lung disease. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Other manifestations of RA'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">GUBNER R, AUGUST S, GINSBERG V.
