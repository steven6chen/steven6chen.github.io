BK and JC viruses encode six viral proteins. These are divided into two &quot;early&quot; nonstructural or enzymatic proteins, an agnoprotein, and three &quot;late&quot; proteins. The early proteins are the large tumor antigen, or &quot;T antigen,&quot; and the small tumor antigen, or the &quot;t antigen.&quot; The T antigen is responsible for cell immortalization and latency. The agnogene, which transcribes the agnoprotein, appears to participate in the assembly of viral particles. The &quot;late&quot; genes encode three viral capsid proteins: VP-1, VP-2, and VP-3.</p><p>BKV has been divided into four serological groups (I to IV) and genotypes, which may have different virulence potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Primary infections tend to occur early in childhood via oral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although primary infections are likely clinically inapparent, the virus preferentially persists in the renal epithelium (transitional epithelium, renal tubular epithelium, and parietal epithelium of Bowman's capsule) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/10,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16,17</a>].</p><p>Intermittent BKV replication, manifested as asymptomatic viruria, occurs in immunocompetent individuals (up to 20 percent incidence of shedding).

In addition to the immunosuppressive effects on T cells by immunosuppressive agents, in vitro data demonstrate that tacrolimus (in contrast to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> or cyclosporine A that inhibit BKV replication) <strong>activates</strong> BKV replication through a mechanism involving FK-binding protein (BP-12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Although not universally accepted, other factors that have been associated with an increased risk of BKVN include older age, male gender, ureteral trauma, diabetes mellitus, delayed graft function (DGF) in renal transplant patients, use of antilymphocyte antibodies, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, treatment for acute rejection, Caucasian ethnicity, use of glucocorticoid maintenance therapy, and specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-C loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/27,29,45-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29,45-49</a>].</p><p>BK viruria and viremia, which precede BKVN, have been associated with high BK-antibody titers in donors and might reflect recent BKV replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Studies have demonstrated that the likely source of BKV in the recipient after transplant is the donor in the majority of cases (rather than reactivation of latent recipient BKV infection) and that pretransplant viruria in the donor is an independent risk factor for posttransplant BKV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p>The risk for BKVN may be higher among HLA- and ABO-mismatched patients, possibly due to the increased rate of rejection and increased immunosuppression among such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/47,51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,51-53</a>]. This effect of HLA mismatching was shown in a study of 444 transplant recipients in whom BKVN was associated with HLA mismatching, the number of rejection episodes, and a higher incidence of steroid-resistant rejection that required antilymphocyte treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. There was no specific HLA allele that was associated with BKVN in this study. In another retrospective cohort study, donor-recipient matching of HLA-A2, HLA-B44, and HLA-DR15 were associated with a lower risk of BK viremia among kidney transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Factors other than increased rate of rejection and increased immunosuppression may contribute to the enhanced risk since the risk among ABO-incompatible patients appears to be higher than that among HLA-mismatched patients. This was demonstrated in a study of 62 ABO-incompatible and 221 HLA-incompatible kidney transplant recipients, of whom 17.7 versus 5.9 percent developed BKVN, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Even after controlling for the number of rejection episodes, ABO incompatibility was an independent predictor of BKVN. The risk of BK viremia is not known in this study.</p><p>Rejection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ischemia of the transplanted kidney may increase the risk of BKVN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. This is suggested by the observation that BKVN rarely occurs in the native kidneys of patients who undergo nonrenal solid organ transplantation, despite similar immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p>Viral-related factors such as polymorphisms within the VP1 and noncoding control region have been suggested to be risk factors by some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], studies. One study failed to find the emergence of significant mutations or deletions in the noncoding control region as patients progressed from BK viruria to sustained BK viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In this study, the antimetabolite was withdrawn in patients who had BK viremia, which prevented progression to BKVN. The authors surmised that withdrawing the antimetabolite may have removed the selective pressure to allow emergence of rearrangements in the noncoding control region that were associated with higher viral replication rates and nephropathy seen in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Infection with other polyoma viruses, such as the JC virus, appears to decrease the risk of BK viral infection.

The combined presence of endarteritis, fibrinoid vascular necrosis, glomerulitis, and C4d deposits along peritubular capillaries is conclusive evidence of concurrent rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], although some patients with BKVN without concurrent rejection may have C4d deposits in the tubular basement membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>Among some patients, it may only be possible to distinguish the effects of BK viral infection from those of rejection by empirically altering the immunosuppressive regimen and observing the clinical response. The most commonly accepted strategy is to lower immunosuppression even when there is histologic evidence of rejection. Others use a short course of steroids (such as pulse intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> for three days, followed by taper) in order to decrease inflammation and then reduce the immunosuppression, or administer intravenous immunoglobulin for its immunomodulatory and possible anti-BK effects.</p><p>The differential diagnosis also includes many disorders associated with early (1 to 12 weeks posttransplantation) and late (more than three months posttransplantation) renal allograft dysfunction. These are reviewed in detail separately.

One case series reported eight immunocompromised patients with BKVN, including six with hematologic malignancies (three with bone marrow transplant), one patient with a lung transplant, and one patient with immunodeficiency secondary to tuberculosis and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. All patients presented with acute kidney injury (AKI); none had significant proteinuria, and only one had an active urine sediment with hematuria and leukocyturia.

Although serum BK viral loads decreased, AKI worsened in all patients, with the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in two patients by three months. There are no controlled trials supporting the use of intravenous cidofovir or leflunomide for treatment of BKV infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of BK virus-induced (polyomavirus-induced) nephropathy in kidney transplantation&quot;, section on 'Screening and prevention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among renal transplant recipients, the major diseases caused by BK virus (BKV) include tubulointerstitial nephritis and ureteral stenosis. The prevalence of BK virus nephropathy (BKVN) in kidney transplant recipients is estimated to be 1 to 10 percent, with a mean of approximately 5 percent. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among renal transplant recipients, clinically significant BKV infection is associated with the degree of immunosuppression, although no specific immunosuppressive drug or combination has been definitively implicated. Other potential risk factors include older and younger age, male gender, ureteral trauma, diabetes mellitus, delayed graft function (DGF), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, use of antilymphocyte antibody, treatment of acute rejection, and white ethnicity. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitative or real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for BK viral DNA of plasma or serum, and less so of urine, appears to be useful in monitoring kidney transplant recipients for BK infection. BK viral infections progress through detectable stages. Viral replication in the urine precedes BK viremia by approximately four weeks. Histologic changes of BKVN are observed 12 weeks after BK viruria. Renal transplant recipients with higher urine DNA levels are more likely to develop detectable DNA in plasma, and prolonged DNAemia precedes clinically overt nephropathy. (See <a href=\"#H1216526726\" class=\"local\">'Quantitative polymerase chain reaction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with BKVN usually present with an asymptomatic acute or slowly progressive rise in the serum creatinine concentration. Urinalysis may reveal pyuria, hematuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cellular casts consisting of renal tubular cells and inflammatory cells. Urine cytologic examination may reveal BK-infected cells called decoy cells. A definitive diagnosis of BKVN is made by renal allograft biopsy. The histologic diagnosis requires the presence of characteristic cytopathic changes and positive immunohistochemistry tests using antibodies directed specifically against BK or against the cross-reacting SV40 large-T antigen. Since BKVN may be missed on one-third of biopsies, at least two biopsy cores, preferably including medulla, should be examined. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of definitive histologic evidence obtained by biopsy, sustained high-grade urine BKV replication (more than two weeks duration) and significant BKV load in blood (plasma DNA PCR load &gt;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> with or without kidney dysfunction defines presumptive BKVN. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major differential diagnosis of BKVN is acute rejection. As noted above, BKVN may be distinguished from allograft rejection by the presence of BKV inclusions and immunohistologic or in situ hybridization evidence of virally infected cells, which are usually tubular epithelial cells, rather than podocytes or endothelial cells. It is important to correlate the histologic findings with PCR evidence of viremia. (See <a href=\"#H1216526833\" class=\"local\">'Histology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The histologic appearance of rejection may occur in more than 50 percent of patients with BKVN. In general, the presence of extensive tubulitis in areas remote from the viral cytopathic changes suggests that acute rejection is present in addition to BKVN. The combined presence of endarteritis, fibrinoid vascular necrosis, glomerulitis, and C4d deposits along peritubular capillaries is conclusive evidence of concurrent rejection. Among some patients, it may only be possible to distinguish the effects of BK viral infection from those of rejection by empirically altering the immunosuppressive regimen and observing the clinical response.
