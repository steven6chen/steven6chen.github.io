It performs many functions that are essential to life.</p><p>A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves obtaining a small piece of liver tissue, which is then analyzed in the laboratory. Liver biopsy may be recommended to diagnose a problem or determine the severity of liver disease. The most common reason to obtain a liver biopsy is to determine if there is scar tissue in the liver (and if there is, how much) in a person with chronic liver disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">REASONS FOR LIVER BIOPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a general rule, a liver biopsy is recommended only when the results would affect your treatment or management. Some of the more common reasons for liver biopsy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) &mdash; NAFLD is a condition in which there are increased amounts of fat in the liver. A liver biopsy may be done to confirm the diagnosis of NAFLD or to see how severely the liver is damaged. NAFLD is the most common reason for liver biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld-including-nonalcoholic-steatohepatitis-nash-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis B or C, primary biliary cholangitis (also known as primary biliary cirrhosis), primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, or Wilson's disease. A biopsy can provide information about how severely the liver is damaged. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hepatitis B (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hepatitis C (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemochromatosis-hereditary-iron-overload-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hemochromatosis (hereditary iron overload) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Autoimmune hepatitis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained liver disease or abnormal liver function tests (blood tests that reflect injury to the liver).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of a mass seen on an imaging test like an ultrasound, computed tomographic (&quot;CAT&quot;) scan, or MRI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring the liver following a liver transplant.</p><p/><p>A liver biopsy may also be helpful in people with unexplained fevers, those with certain rare metabolic diseases, in some (but not all) patients taking the medication methotrexate, and other less common disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVER BIOPSY PREPARATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to a liver biopsy, a healthcare provider will check blood tests that reflect how well your blood clots. Normal blood clotting is important to prevent bleeding after the biopsy.</p><p>You should carry a list of your medications, including over-the-counter medications, herbs, and vitamins. Discuss this list with your clinician before the biopsy to see if you need to stop any medications, herbs, or vitamins temporarily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications to avoid before liver biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are usually advised <strong>not</strong> to take medications that can increase the risk of bleeding. These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspirin or aspirin-containing medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen (eg, Motrin, Advil), and naproxen (eg, Aleve). Many non-prescription medicines contain NSAIDs, so check the labels or ask your pharmacist for help.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines used to prevent blood clots, such as warfarin (Coumadin).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medicines for heart conditions (such as abciximab [Reopro], dipyridamole [Persantine], ticlopidine [Ticlid], and clopidogrel [Plavix]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some herbal therapies (such as fish oil or ginkgo biloba).</p><p/><p>Do not stop any medications without first talking with your clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing before liver biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is common to have an ultrasound of the liver and gallbladder area before the biopsy so that your doctor can pinpoint the biopsy site. Ultrasounds are not required in every case; the need for ultrasound will be determined by the doctor who does the biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Eating before liver biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should have nothing to eat or drink for six hours before the procedure. You may be allowed to have a light breakfast only, such as black tea or coffee and toast. Some doctors recommend eating a small amount of fat (such as butter or margarine) with breakfast, which will empty the gallbladder and potentially decrease the risk of gallbladder injury during the biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVER BIOPSY PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most liver biopsies are done in a hospital. Upon arrival for the biopsy (usually in the early morning), a doctor or nurse will review your medical history, including medications and allergies. You may have an IV line placed into a vein so that fluid and medicine can be given if needed.</p><p>You may be given medicines to minimize discomfort and anxiety. Because your cooperation is needed during a liver biopsy, you will not be put to sleep.</p><p>The biopsy itself only takes a few seconds as the biopsy needle is passed quickly in and out of the liver. A small bandage will be applied to the biopsy site; stitches are not needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVER BIOPSY COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A liver biopsy is a very safe procedure when performed by an experienced doctor. The most common problems include mild pain and a minor decrease in blood pressure. More serious complications, such as bleeding, infection, and injury to nearby organs, are very rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CARE AFTER LIVER BIOPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the liver biopsy, you will be asked to lie on your right side, and a nurse will monitor your blood pressure and pulse periodically. Many people watch television or a video, read, or talk with friends or family.</p><p>You will need to arrange to have someone take you home after the biopsy because sedative medications are often used. A friend or family member can also help pass the time during the few hours of observation following the biopsy.</p><p>In addition to resting the day of the biopsy, you should plan to take it easy for the next five to seven days. In general, you should not lift more than 15 to 20 pounds for a week, avoid blood-thinning medication for several days, and call with any concerning symptoms, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe pain at the biopsy site or shoulder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the biopsy site</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (temperature greater than 100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness, sweating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart palpitations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in your stool or black, tarry stool</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biopsy report is usually available within a few days to a week after the biopsy. Call your doctor or make a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the biopsy and what treatment (if any) is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=4579\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
