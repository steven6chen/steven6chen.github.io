It is the most prevalent form of severe antibody deficiency affecting both children and adults. &quot;Variable&quot; refers to the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of this disorder, which include recurrent infections, chronic lung disease, autoimmune disorders, gastrointestinal disease, and a heightened susceptibility to lymphoma.</p><p>CVID is not a single disease, but rather a collection of hypogammaglobulinemia syndromes resulting from many genetic defects. In a small subset of patients, specific molecular defects have been identified, although in most cases these causes are, as of yet, unknown.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, epidemiology, evaluation, and diagnosis of CVID will be discussed here, with a focus on presentation in adult patients. Issues that are particularly relevant to the clinical manifestations and diagnosis in children are reviewed separately. The pathogenesis and treatment in adults are also presented separately.

An internet-based registry and database of patients with primary immunodeficiency has been established by the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID), in which CVID is the most common diagnosis, affecting approximately 20 percent of registered patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>CVID is sometimes diagnosed in childhood, but more typically after puberty. In an analysis of the CVID data from the ESID registry collected between the years of 2004 and 2012, 34 percent of patients were diagnosed before 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In studies from United States centers, approximately 20 percent of patients are diagnosed before the age of 20 years. The majority of patients are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 45 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-adults/abstract/3,4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,9</a>].</p><p>While the onset of clinical symptoms may be apparent in young children, the diagnosis of CVID should not be made definitively until further immune maturation has occurred, which takes place by the age of four years in most children. Diagnosis in children is discussed separately.

Perhaps partly for this reason, delayed recognition of this disease is common. In the above study, there was an average of five to seven years between onset of symptoms and diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-adults/abstract/4,5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,10</a>].

Class-switching cannot occur without functional AICDA or UNG, therefore B cells can only produce appreciable quantities of IgM. Patients with AICDA and UNG deficiencies generally present with the recurrent and severe sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated bacteria that are characteristic of antibody deficiencies. Gastrointestinal infections (including Giardiasis), bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, and severe hepatitis B infections have also been observed, and patients are susceptible to lymph node hyperplasia and autoimmune disorders.</p><p>Among patients with CD40 ligand, AICDA, and UNG deficiencies, IgG levels are generally &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> while IgA is &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and IgM ranges from 100 to 3700 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.

The characteristic immune defect in CVID is impaired B cell differentiation with defective production of immunoglobulin. CVID is defined by low total serum concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG), as well as low immunoglobulin A (IgA) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunoglobulin M (IgM), poor or absent response to immunization, and the absence of any other defined immunodeficiency state. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1191858\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age of onset is variable. Most patients are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 years. Delayed recognition is common. (See <a href=\"#H1191865\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial infections of the sinopulmonary tract, particularly sinusitis and pneumonia, are experienced by most patients with CVID (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F89794\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89794 \">table 1</a>). Opportunistic and unusual infections are uncommon, but do occur. (See <a href=\"#H1193458\" class=\"local\">'Infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to recurrent infections, patients with CVID have evidence of immune dysregulation leading to autoimmunity, a variety of inflammatory disorders, and malignant disease. Patients may suffer from chronic lung disease, gastrointestinal and liver disorders, granulomatous infiltrations, lymphoid hyperplasia, splenomegaly, or malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H178471451\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic lung diseases, especially bronchiectasis, are seen in 30 to 50 percent of patients, and represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H1193479\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gastrointestinal disease is present in about 20 percent of CVID patients, with a variety of different disorders described. The pathophysiology of most of these disorders is not known. Chronic diarrhea is the most common presenting gastrointestinal symptom. Chronic infections with giardia, cytomegalovirus, and cryptosporidium are also reported (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F89794\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89794 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9597804\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One-quarter of patients with CVID develop autoimmune conditions, particularly hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and rheumatoid arthritis, and an estimated 8 to 20 percent have some form of granulomatous disease. (See <a href=\"#H1193493\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1193500\" class=\"local\">'Granulomatous infiltration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with CVID are at increased risk for malignancies, and have a particular susceptibility to non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). (See <a href=\"#H1193528\" class=\"local\">'Malignancies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CVID requires a suggestive clinical history, a reduced total serum concentration of IgG, plus low IgA or IgM, and poor responses to both protein- and polysaccharide-based vaccines. (See <a href=\"#H1196168\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various forms of primary and secondary hypogammaglobulinemia must be excluded before the diagnosis of CVID can be assigned.
