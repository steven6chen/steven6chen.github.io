Infection may lead to respiratory disease, cutaneous disease, or an asymptomatic carrier state. The word diphtheria comes from the Greek word for leather, which refers to the tough pharyngeal membrane that is the clinical hallmark of infection.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of diphtheria will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, and prevention of this infection are discussed separately.

Symptoms typically begin two to five days after infection. In addition to respiratory symptoms, absorption and dissemination of diphtheria toxin can lead to toxin damage of the heart (myocarditis), nervous system, and kidneys.</p><p>The onset of symptoms is typically gradual; the most common presenting symptoms are sore throat, malaise, cervical lymphadenopathy, and low-grade fever. The earliest pharyngeal finding is mild erythema, which can progress to isolated spots of gray and white exudate. In at least one-third of cases, local elaboration of toxin induces the formation of a coalescing pseudomembrane (composed of necrotic fibrin, leukocytes, erythrocytes, epithelial cells, and organisms) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52701\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52701 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51058\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51058 \">picture 2</a>). This membrane adheres tightly to the underlying tissue and bleeds with scraping.</p><p>This membrane can extend to any portion of the respiratory tract from the nasal passages to the tracheobronchial tree. Up to two-thirds of cases are tonsillopharyngeal; involvement of the laryngeal, nasal, and tracheobronchial areas is less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Systemic toxicity increases as the pseudomembrane spreads from the tonsillopharyngeal area. A form of malignant diphtheria is associated with extensive &quot;membranous pharyngitis&quot; plus massive swelling of the tonsils, uvula, cervical lymph nodes, submandibular region, and anterior neck (the so-called &quot;bull neck&quot; of toxic diphtheria). In such cases, respiratory stridor may ensue, leading to respiratory insufficiency and death. In addition, aspiration of the membrane can lead to suffocation.</p><p>In untreated patients, the infectious period begins at symptom onset and lasts for two weeks in the majority of patients; in some cases, it can last as long as six weeks. In patients treated with appropriate antibiotics, the infectious period usually lasts less than four days.</p><p>Other respiratory tract symptoms vary with the site of involvement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with nasal diphtheria usually experience mild disease and present with a <span class=\"nowrap\">serosanguineous/purulent</span> nasal discharge, which can cause mild irritation of the external nares and upper lip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngeal diphtheria often presents with hoarseness and cough. The larynx may be the only site of infection (laryngoscopy will demonstrate a laryngeal pseudomembrane) or may be part of a continuum of respiratory tract involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheobronchial infection usually develops secondary to membrane spread and may result in respiratory compromise, especially in children who have small airways.</p><p/><p><em>C. diphtheriae</em> may be cultured from mucous membranes or skin from asymptomatic carriers, who are an important reservoir for the organism in endemic areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9473003\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absorption and dissemination of diphtheria toxin can lead to toxin damage of the heart (myocarditis), nervous system, and kidneys. In one retrospective study of 676 patients hospitalized with diphtheria in the Kyrgyz Republic, 30 percent had severe forms including 22 percent with myocarditis; 28 percent had exclusively tonsillar disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A report from Finland noted a 28 percent incidence of cardiac involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The risk of developing cardiac <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic toxicity is proportional to the severity of local infection. Myocarditis (as evidenced by electrocardiographic changes such as ST-T wave changes, QTc prolongation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> first-degree heart block) can be detected in up to two-thirds of cases. The onset typically begins as local respiratory symptoms are improving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Clinically evident cardiac dysfunction (decreased heart sounds, gallop rhythm, cardiac dilatation, dyspnea) occurs in 10 to 25 percent of patients with diphtheria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Severe myocarditis is manifested by complex heart blocks and arrhythmias, heart failure, and circulatory collapse. Patients should be monitored with serial electrocardiograms and measurements of cardiac enzymes that reflect the intensity of myocardial damage. Cardiac complications are a major cause of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The time course for onset of myocarditis is variable; it typically occurs 7 to 14 days after the onset of respiratory symptoms. In one cohort, severe pseudomembrane and the &quot;bull neck&quot; of diphtheria preceded cardiomyopathy with positive predictive value of approximately 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The presence of myocarditis is a poor prognostic factor; in one cohort of children in India, it was the strongest predictor of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Neurologic toxicity occurs in approximately 5 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Neurological toxicity is unusual in patients with mild disease, but it may develop in up to 75 percent of patients with severe diphtheria. Local neuropathies (paralysis of the soft palate and posterior pharyngeal wall) are followed by cranial neuropathies (usually oculomotor and ciliary, followed by facial or laryngeal paralyses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Peripheral neuritis develops weeks to months later and can span the clinical spectrum from mild weakness to total paralysis. The severity of disease correlates with the severity of membrane formation (and therefore toxin production) as well as the time between the onset of symptoms and administration of antitoxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Renal failure from direct toxin activity or hypotension may occur in severe cases.</p><p>Non-toxigenic <em>C. diphtheriae</em> strains have been implicated in cases of endocarditis, mycotic aneurysms, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9473009\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous diphtheria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous diphtheria can be caused by toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains of <em>C. diphtheriae</em>, though systemic toxicity is rare. Cutaneous diphtheria is characterized by chronic, nonhealing sores or shallow ulcers with a dirty gray membrane; the appearance is fairly nonspecific (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53408\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53408 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63145\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63145 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Cutaneous diphtheria can also present in the form of colonization and infection of preexisting dermatoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The diagnosis is made by culturing the organism from a skin lesion. Local trauma frequently precedes cutaneous infection. Previous outbreaks of cutaneous disease have occurred in impoverished populations with poor access to the healthcare system, such as the homeless and intravenous drug abusers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Skin infections typically result in a brisk antibody response, in contrast to pharyngeal infections (which may not result in subsequent immunity). Therefore, individuals with skin infection have a relatively low likelihood of developing the pharyngeal form of the disease; however, skin ulcers serve as a reservoir to infect susceptible hosts, particularly in regions where herd immunity is low due to suboptimal vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].</p><p>Outbreaks of cutaneous diphtheria in the United States have been described among alcoholic homeless men and other impoverished groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. However, since 1980, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has dropped cutaneous diphtheria caused by non-toxigenic strains from its list of reportable diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of diphtheria should be considered in the setting of relevant clinical manifestations (sore throat, malaise, cervical lymphadenopathy, and low-grade fever) together with appropriate epidemiologic risk factors. Mild pharyngeal erythema typically progresses to areas of white exudate; these coalesce to form an adherent gray pseudomembrane that bleeds with scraping. Clinical suspicion for diphtheria should be further heightened in the setting of adherent pharyngeal, palatal, or nasal membranes, systemic toxicity, hoarseness, stridor, palatal paralysis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serosanguineous nasal discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9472991\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Definitive diagnosis of diphtheria requires culture of <em>C. diphtheriae</em> from respiratory tract secretions or cutaneous lesions and a positive toxin assay. Routine laboratory results are usually nonspecific and may include a moderately elevated white blood cell count and proteinuria.</p><p>Definitive cases of diphtheria in the United States should be reported immediately to the state health department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and culture material should be sent to the CDC for confirmation. The CDC Pertussis and Diphtheria Laboratory offers culture, toxigenicity testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and serology. For detailed information on specimen collection and shipping and to arrange PCR testing, the laboratory can be contacted by phone (404-639-1231) or fax (404-639-4421). In other countries, reports should be submitted to the World Health Organization (WHO).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cultures should be obtained from the throat and nose including a portion of the membrane (if possible) and material from beneath the membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Special culture media (Loffler's or Tindale's) are required; the microbiology laboratory should be notified of the suspected diagnosis so that the specimen is plated on appropriate media. Transport to the laboratory must be accomplished quickly since the media must be inoculated promptly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>A presumptive diagnosis of <em>C. diphtheriae</em> can be made by identifying gram-positive rods in a &quot;Chinese character&quot; distribution on Gram stain, black colonies with halos on Tindale's media, and metachromatic granules on Loffler's media (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73771\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73771 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Once the organism is presumptively identified, biochemical testing can be performed to confirm <em>C. diphtheriae</em>; it is catalase positive, urease negative, cystinase positive, and pyrazinamidase negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxin detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for toxin production must be performed to differentiate toxigenic from non-toxigenic strains of <em>C. diphtheriae</em>. If clinical suspicion for diphtheria is high, antitoxin should be administered promptly prior to confirmation of toxin production, which may take several days depending upon the method used.</p><p>Toxin production can be demonstrated by an in vitro assay that detects development of an immunoprecipitin band on antitoxin-impregnated filter paper laid over an agar culture of the organism (Elek test) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The test requires quality control of reagents and a standardized procedure so is best performed in a reference laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>PCR testing for the A subunit of the diphtheria toxin gene can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A positive PCR for the diphtheria toxin gene demonstrates the presence of the gene but does not indicate whether toxin is being produced; therefore, positive PCR results must be confirmed by culture to establish the presence of clinical disease due to a toxigenic strain of <em>C. diphtheriae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A negative PCR is helpful in excluding the diagnosis of diphtheria. PCR can be performed on colonies extracted from a plate or on clinical specimens. One group reported successful PCR testing on a formalin-fixed throat swab, which would not be suitable for culturing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>A rapid enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the detection of diphtheria toxin production has been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a study of 245 mixed strains of <em>Corynebacterium</em>, comparable results were observed with EIA and Elek, though EIA testing was faster (3 versus 24 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of respiratory diphtheria includes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F98480\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98480 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious mononucleosis &ndash; Clinical manifestations of infectious mononucleosis include fever, pharyngitis, adenopathy, and fatigue.

In severely ill patients with signs of extensive pseudomembrane formation, stridor, or the toxic &quot;bull neck&quot; of diphtheria, respiratory failure should be anticipated and managed aggressively. Intubation may help to protect the airway, although frequently this is a difficult procedure in patients with diphtheria due to extensive airway edema and mucosal friability; there is also potential for inadvertent dislodging of the pseudomembrane. Ideally, intubation should be performed by experienced providers in the setting of operative backup for tracheostomy for definitive airway management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follow-up cultures should be performed at 24 to 48 hours and two weeks following infection to document clearance.

Of the 19 patients who died, 79 percent presented to the hospital &ge;4 days after onset of symptoms.

In addition, the mortality rate was higher in patients &lt;15 years of age than patients &ge;15 years of age (5.5 versus 1.7 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15943994\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory diphtheria is typically caused by toxin-producing strains of <em>C. diphtheriae</em>; rarely, it is caused by toxigenic strains of other <em>Corynebacterium species</em> (<em>C. ulcerans</em>, <em>C. hemolyticum</em>, or <em>C. pseudotuberculosis</em>). Symptoms typically begin two to five days after infection. The most common presenting findings are sore throat, malaise, cervical lymphadenopathy, and low-grade fever. (See <a href=\"#H9472997\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory diphtheria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In at least one-third of cases, local elaboration of toxin induces the formation of a coalescing pseudomembrane (composed of necrotic fibrin, leukocytes, erythrocytes, epithelial cells, and organisms). This membrane can extend to any portion of the respiratory tract from the nasal passages to the tracheobronchial tree. Up to two-thirds of cases have tonsillopharyngeal involvement; involvement of the laryngeal, nasal, and tracheobronchial areas is less common. (See <a href=\"#H9472997\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory diphtheria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diphtheritic membrane is classically gray in color and adheres tightly to the underlying tissue, such that dislodgement results in bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52701\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52701 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51058\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51058 \">picture 2</a>). Systemic toxicity increases as the pseudomembrane spreads from the tonsillopharyngeal area. Absorption and dissemination of diphtheria toxin can lead to toxin damage of the heart and nervous system. Clinically evident cardiac dysfunction occurs in about 10 to 25 percent of patients; neurologic toxicity occurs in approximately 5 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H9473003\" class=\"local\">'Systemic manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous diphtheria is characterized by chronic, nonhealing sores or shallow ulcers with a dirty gray membrane. Cutaneous diphtheria can also present in the form of colonization and infection of preexisting dermatoses. Systemic toxicity is rare. (See <a href=\"#H9473009\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous diphtheria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of diphtheria should be considered in the setting of relevant clinical manifestations (sore throat, malaise, cervical lymphadenopathy, and low-grade fever) together with appropriate epidemiologic risk factors. Definitive diagnosis of diphtheria requires culture of <em>C. diphtheriae</em> from respiratory tract secretions or cutaneous lesions and a positive toxin assay. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cultures should be obtained from the throat and nose including a portion of the membrane (if possible) and material from beneath the membrane. Special culture media are required; the microbiology laboratory should be notified of the suspected diagnosis so that the specimen is plated on appropriate media. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Culture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for toxin production must be performed to differentiate toxigenic from non-toxigenic strains of <em>C. diphtheriae</em>. If clinical suspicion for diphtheria is high, antitoxin should be administered promptly prior to confirmation of toxin production, which may take several days depending upon the method used. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Toxin detection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of respiratory diphtheria consists of antibiotic therapy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphtheria-antitoxin-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphtheria antitoxin</a>. Antitoxin can induce serum sickness; precautions and dosing are outlined above. We recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> or penicillin for treatment of diphtheria (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Dosing is outlined above.

Patients should be placed on respiratory droplet isolation for respiratory tract disease and contact precautions for cutaneous disease. Patients should be monitored with serial electrocardiograms and measurements of cardiac enzymes that reflect the intensity of myocardial damage. Neurologic status should also be monitored carefully. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up cultures should be performed at 24 to 48 hours and two weeks following infection ensure eradication of the organism.
