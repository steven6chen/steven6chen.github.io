The blood pressure readings should be documented on at least two occasions at least four hours apart. Gestational hypertension is severe when systolic blood pressure is &ge;160 mmHg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic blood pressure is &ge;110 mmHg.</p><p>Gestational hypertension is a temporary diagnosis for hypertensive pregnant women who do not meet criteria for preeclampsia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79977\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79977 \">table 1</a>) or chronic hypertension (hypertension first detected before the 20<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy).

It occurs in 6 to 17 percent of healthy nulliparous women and 2 to 4 percent of multiparous women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].&nbsp;The prevalence is highest in women with preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, women with multifetal gestation, and <span class=\"nowrap\">overweight/obese</span> women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H614786590\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors are similar to those for preeclampsia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2006628663\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.) However, epidemiologic studies report differences in the magnitude of the associations for the two disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main goals in the initial evaluation of pregnant women with newly developed hypertension are to distinguish gestational hypertension from preeclampsia, which has a different course and prognosis, and to determine whether hypertension is severe, which affects management and outcome.</p><p>As in other patients with newly diagnosed hypertension, white coat hypertension (also called isolated clinic or office hypertension) should be excluded by repeating measurement of blood pressure when the patient is relaxed. Results of home blood pressure monitoring can be useful to establish the patient&rsquo;s blood pressure profile. If an automated device is used in the home or office, it should have been validated in a pregnant population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring and white coat hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In addition, the following evaluation should be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Measure protein excretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary protein excretion should be determined since the presence or absence of proteinuria is the key clinical criterion that determines whether the patient will be given a diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. A urine dipstick of negative to trace should not be used to definitively exclude significant proteinuria since false negative results occur with low specific gravity (&lt;1.010), high salt concentration, highly acidic urine, or with nonalbumin proteinuria. A positive urine dipstick value, especially if only +1, also requires confirmation since false positives occur. Urine protein can be quantitated using a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio &ge;0.26 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mg</span> creatinine (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol)</span> on a random urine sample or with a 24-hour urine collection. We prefer the latter, as it conforms to the most widely accepted diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proteinuria in pregnancy: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Even after this evaluation, it can be difficult to exclude preeclampsia conclusively. Studies have shown that 10 percent of women with clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> histological manifestations of preeclampsia have no proteinuria and 20 percent of women with eclampsia (a form of severe preeclampsia) do not have significant proteinuria prior to their seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Therefore, when hypertension is accompanied by any of the signs and symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79977\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79977 \">table 1</a>), the patient should be managed as a patient with preeclampsia, even if proteinuria is not present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluate for features of severe disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be questioned about the presence of severe features of preeclampsia, such as the new onset of cerebral or visual disturbances or epigastric or right upper quadrant pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111086\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111086 \">table 2</a>). The chest should be auscultated to assess for pulmonary edema. The presence of any of these findings upgrades the diagnosis to preeclampsia with severe features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Perform laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory evaluation helps to determine whether there is end organ involvement, which occurs with preeclampsia but not gestational hypertension. Changes consistent with preeclampsia with severe features include thrombocytopenia, increase in creatinine concentration to &gt;1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and doubling of hepatic transaminases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111086\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111086 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Determine the severity of hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension in pregnancy is defined as systolic blood pressure &ge;140 mmHg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic blood pressure &ge;90 mmHg. It is considered severe when systolic blood pressure is &ge;160 mmHg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic blood pressure is &ge;110 mmHg. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Assess fetal well-being</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with all hypertensive pregnancies, fetal well-being should be assessed with a biophysical profile or nonstress test with amniotic fluid estimation. We also obtain a sonographic estimation of fetal weight; umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry is reserved for fetuses with growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antepartum fetal surveillance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14926620\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF PROGRESSION TO PREECLAMPSIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ten to 50 percent of women initially diagnosed with gestational hypertension go on to develop preeclampsia in one to five weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>It is not clear whether gestational hypertension and preeclampsia are independent diseases with a similar phenotype (hypertension) or if gestational hypertension is an early mild stage of preeclampsia. There is consistent evidence that preeclampsia develops in a substantial proportion of women initially diagnosed with gestational hypertension, and that women who progress to preeclampsia have characteristics different from those who continue to have nonproteinuric hypertension. Clinical characteristics at presentation of gestational hypertension that predict an increased risk for progression to preeclampsia include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational age less than 34 weeks at diagnosis (sensitivity 85 percent, specificity 60 percent) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean systolic blood pressure &gt;135 mmHg on 24 hour blood pressure monitoring (sensitivity 61 percent, specificity 76 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated serum uric acid level (&gt;5.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [309 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> (sensitivity 88 percent, specificity 93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>] </p><p/><p>Abnormal uterine artery Doppler velocimetry has also been found to be predictive (sensitivity 86 percent, specificity 90 percent); however, uterine artery Doppler is not routinely performed clinically.</p><p>Other characteristics have been reported to be predictive, but are not readily measureable: elevated serum levels of anti-angiogenic markers (eg, sFlt- 1), reduced levels of proangiogenic placental growth factor, and higher total vascular resistance (&gt;1340 dyne <span class=\"nowrap\">seconds/cm<sup>5</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. </p><p>Some data suggest preeclampsia and gestational hypertension are independent diseases. Although they share many risk factors, epidemiologic studies report differences in the magnitude of the associations for the two disorders. For example, primiparity is a stronger risk factor for preeclampsia than for gestational hypertension (odds ratio 2.2 versus 1.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and multiple gestation and diabetes mellitus are stronger risk factors for preeclampsia than gestational hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/7,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19</a>]. Prognosis is also different: the recurrence rate for gestational hypertension is several-fold higher than that for preeclampsia (&gt;20 percent versus about 5 percent for preeclampsia at term) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p>Others have reported physiological and histological differences between the two disorders. Total blood and plasma volumes are significantly higher in women with gestational hypertension (3139 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> and 2132 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> respectively) than in women with preeclampsia (mean 2660 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> and 1790 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], Doppler measures of arterial and venous hemodynamics and vascular endothelial function are normal in women with gestational hypertension and abnormal in women with preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/15,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,23</a>], and levels of microparticles associated with endothelial cell damage are significantly lower in women with gestational hypertension than in women with preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].&nbsp;Histological signs of placental ischemia are less prominent in gestational hypertension than in preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to deliver women with preterm gestational hypertension attempts to balance three competing factors: (1) the fetal benefits from expectant management (ie, further growth and maturation), (2) the maternal and fetal benefits from early intervention (ie, avoidance of complications from progression of hypertensive disease over the remainder of pregnancy), and (3) the maternal and fetal risks from expectant management (eg, progression of hypertensive disease and possible sequelae, including stillbirth or asphyxia). We believe close surveillance of pregnancies with non-severe gestational hypertension managed expectantly can mitigate the risk of development of serious sequelae of gestational hypertension; therefore, we manage these patients expectantly and deliver them when their clinical situation deteriorates or at term. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Timing of delivery'</a> below.)</p><p>This strategy is supported by the HYPITAT-II trial, which randomly assigned women with non-severe hypertensive disorders of pregnancy at 34<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</span> </sup>to 36<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</span> </sup>weeks to immediate delivery or to expectant management with delivery at term or upon development of features of severe preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Three percent of women with gestational hypertension (new hypertension with diastolic blood pressure &ge;100 mmHg and no proteinuria) managed expectantly developed one or more adverse maternal outcomes (thromboembolic complications, HELLP syndrome, eclampsia, placental abruption) versus no woman in the immediate delivery group, but immediate delivery also resulted in more cases of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (4.3 versus 1.1 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood pressure less than 160/110 mmHg</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14927470\"><span class=\"h3\">Site of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with gestational hypertension without severe blood pressure elevation (ie, systolic blood pressure is &ge;160 mmHg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic blood pressure is &ge;110 mmHg) can be managed safely as outpatients with weekly or twice weekly antepartum visits to measure blood pressure and protein excretion. Home blood pressure monitoring can be useful to determine the patient&rsquo;s average and peak blood pressure during usual activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14928791\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient education and counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient education and counseling are important components of management since these patients are at increased risk of developing preeclampsia and other pregnancy complications. We instruct patients to promptly report any symptoms suggestive of preeclampsia (headache, visual changes, epigastric or right upper quadrant pain). We also review signs suggestive of possible fetal impairment, such as decreased fetal movement and vaginal bleeding, and signs of preterm labor. Patients should be given appropriate telephone numbers to call care providers. Heavy vaginal bleeding, severe headache (&quot;worse headache of my life&quot;), stroke symptoms, severe breathing problems, or sudden severe pain are considered medical emergencies because they can be associated with a life-threatening condition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14927476\"><span class=\"h3\">Level of physical activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women may maintain most of their normal physical activities. Bedrest at home or in the hospital does not prevent progression to preeclampsia or improve maternal or fetal outcome, but reduces the frequency of worsening hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The decision to place a patient on bedrest should be individualized and should take into consideration her blood pressures, comorbidities, and social factors. Prolonged bedrest should be avoided because it increases the risk of venous thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>We advise against strength training and pure isometric exercise, such as weight lifting, as these activities can acutely raise blood pressure to severe levels. Aerobic exercise can cause a modest rise in systolic pressure, usually with no change or a slight reduction in diastolic pressure. In the absence of information about a woman&rsquo;s blood pressure response to her usual aerobic exercise activities, we advise against aerobic exercise.</p><p>Whether and how many hours the patient continues to work outside her home depends on multiple factors, particularly her blood pressure at work. These decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.

We do not begin aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia after 20 weeks of gestation and therefore do not prescribe it for women with gestational hypertension. Meta-analyses have shown that beginning low dose aspirin in the second trimester to pregnant women at average or high risk of developing preeclampsia is associated with a modest reduction in preeclampsia and its sequelae (growth restriction, preterm birth) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, the included trials had a wide variety of inclusion and exclusion criteria, with some including and others excluding women with gestational hypertension. Most women in these trials began low dose aspirin before 20 weeks of gestation. Practice guidelines consistently recommend initiating low dose aspirin before 20 weeks for this reason and because preeclampsia is known to affect placental development early in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-prevention#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Prevention&quot;, section on 'Low-dose aspirin'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14928751\"><span class=\"h3\">Maternal blood pressure and laboratory monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines that suggest monitoring blood pressure once or twice weekly in the office and weekly assessment of proteinuria, platelet count, and liver enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Proteinuria, thrombocytopenic, or elevated liver enzymes change the diagnosis to preeclampsia, and these patients should be managed accordingly. As discussed above, home blood pressure monitoring can be useful to determine the patient&rsquo;s average and peak blood pressure during usual activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

We order either a nonstress test with sonographic estimation of the amniotic fluid index or a biophysical profile weekly. Testing is begun at 32 weeks of gestation, or earlier if an increased risk of fetal demise is identified and delivery for perinatal benefit would be considered if test results are abnormal. </p><p>We also perform serial ultrasound examinations to monitor fetal growth every three to four weeks, as hypertension of any etiology may be associated with placental insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-hypertension/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].
