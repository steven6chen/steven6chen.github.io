Although the cause is usually benign, palpitations are occasionally a manifestation of potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. As a result, the concern about missing a treatable condition may lead to the inappropriate use of expensive tests with little diagnostic and therapeutic value.</p><p>The common presentations of palpitations in adults and a guide to rational diagnostic testing and therapy are reviewed here. The approach to palpitations in children and the management of documented arrhythmias are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with tachycardia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-management-for-the-primary-care-clinician\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia management for the primary care clinician&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palpitations are a sensory symptom. They are defined as an unpleasant awareness of the forceful, rapid, or irregular beating of the heart. Patients may at times describe the sensation as a rapid fluttering in the chest, flip-flopping in the chest, or a pounding sensation in the chest or neck, and these descriptions may help elucidate the cause of the palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Description'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of palpitations is extensive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64306\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64306 \">table 1</a>), and the etiology varies depending upon the population studied. In a study of 190 patients presenting with a chief complaint of palpitations to a university medical center, an etiology was determined in 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The cause was cardiac in 43 percent, psychiatric in 31 percent, and miscellaneous (eg, medication-induced, thyrotoxicosis, caffeine, cocaine, anemia, amphetamine, mastocytosis) in 10 percent. A cardiac etiology was more common in patients presenting to the emergency department than to the medical clinic (47 versus 21 percent), while psychiatric etiologies were more common in the medical clinic (45 versus 27 percent). Cardiac etiologies may also be more common among patients who present to a specialist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palpitations may be a feature of several psychiatric disorders, including panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder, somatization, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Palpitations are a symptom and can occur in the absence of a cardiac arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. When palpitations are associated with anxiety or panic, it is frequently difficult for the patient to discern whether the feeling of anxiety or panic preceded or resulted from the palpitations.</p><p>Psychiatric illness may coexist in patients with another etiology of palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. As an example, in the university study cited above, 24 of the 190 patients (13 percent) were assigned more than one etiology for palpitations; 21 were coexisting psychiatric illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A second report of 107 patients with electrophysiologically documented reentrant supraventricular tachycardia found that there was a median duration of 3.3 years between the initial presentation to a physician and the definitive diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia; 67 percent of the patients also met the criteria for panic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Supraventricular tachycardia was not diagnosed during an initial medical evaluation in 59 patients and 32 received a diagnosis of panic, stress, or anxiety disorder; 65 percent of these individuals were women. These findings suggest that although there is good evidence that psychiatric disorders are a common cause of palpitations, this diagnosis should not be accepted until arrhythmic etiologies have been excluded.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned, cardiac disorders are a common cause of palpitations, and their possible presence generates the most concern among physicians evaluating patients with this complaint. The spectrum of cardiac etiologies ranges from arrhythmias (virtually any new deviation from normal sinus rhythm or a significant change in the rate of a stable arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation, can cause palpitations) to valvular heart disease (eg, mitral or aortic insufficiency, mitral valve prolapse), the pacemaker syndrome, cardiomyopathy, and atrial myxoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64306\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64306 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Most patients with palpitations who undergo ambulatory monitoring are found to have benign supraventricular or ventricular ectopy or normal sinus rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]; normal sinus rhythm is found in up to one-third. Ventricular premature contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia are also found in a substantial proportion of patients with palpitations; they are not associated with increased mortality in patients with structurally normal hearts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-premature-beats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular premature beats&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraventricular-premature-beats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraventricular premature beats&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the university study cited above, four variables were independent predictors of a cardiac etiology of palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Description of an irregular heart beat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of heart disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Event duration &gt;5 minutes</p><p/><p>None of the patients with zero predictors had a cardiac etiology, compared with 26, 48, and 71 percent of patients with 1, 2, and 3 predictors, respectively.</p><p>Despite the relatively high prevalence of cardiac disorders in this study, the short-term prognosis was excellent; mortality during one year of follow-up was documented in only three women, all over age 70, and none of the deaths was sudden or directly related to the original etiology of palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The one-year stroke rate was also low (1.1 percent).</p><p>A second outcome study reported similar findings. In this retrospective cohort study of 109 patients with palpitations evaluated in a primary care setting, there was no difference in morbidity or mortality compared with age and sex matched controls over a mean 42 month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Ventricular tachycardia was responsible for palpitations in only four patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Arrhythmias during catecholamine excess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of sustained supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias may be provoked by sympathetic stimulation and catecholamine excess, as occurs during exercise or at times of stress. Studies in which exercise testing was performed revealed that nonsustained supraventricular and ventricular premature beats are more common than sustained arrhythmias, and the incidence of any arrhythmia is increased in patients with underlying heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing to determine prognosis of coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Ventricular arrhythmias'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing to determine prognosis of coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Atrial arrhythmias'</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT), especially when it arises from the right ventricular outflow tract, can occur during exercise in patients with structurally normal hearts; this arrhythmia most often presents during the second and third decades of life as palpitations, dizziness, or syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF), can be induced during exercise or at the termination of exercise when the withdrawal of catecholamines is coupled with a surge in vagal tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. AF occurring during this relative increase in vagal tone is particularly common in athletic men in the third to sixth decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Autonomic dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p>Catecholamine excess resulting in arrhythmia may also occur during emotionally startling experiences. As an example, patients with the long QT syndrome, especially congenital type 1 or 2 (an inherited abnormality of myocardial repolarization), characteristically present with palpitations during periods of vigorous exercise or emotional stress; the mechanism is often a polymorphic VT known as torsades de pointes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Inappropriate sinus tachycardia is a rare disorder that manifests as palpitations during minimal exertion or with emotional stress. This arrhythmia is characterized by an inappropriate increase in the sinus rate and is most frequently seen in young women; it may result from a hypersensitivity to beta-adrenergic stimulation. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the vast majority of outpatients with palpitations, the cause of the palpitations is benign, and extensive and costly investigation is not warranted. Attention to characteristics that identify patients at high risk for serious causes of palpitations will help define the much smaller percentage of patients with palpitations who require more extensive diagnostic testing and management of their condition.</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of all patients with palpitations should include a detailed history, physical examination, and 12-lead electrocardiography. This, plus some limited laboratory testing, is sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis in more than one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Ambulatory monitoring is helpful in the remainder, and rare patients need more specialized testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should include information on the characteristic presentation of the palpitations, associated sensations, and the patient's age at the onset of palpitations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Age of onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age does not appear to be an independent predictor of the presence or absence of a cardiac etiology of palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. On the other hand, age may help narrow the differential diagnosis of certain arrhythmias. As an example, a patient who has had rapid palpitations since childhood is most likely to have a supraventricular tachycardia, particularly one that uses a bypass tract, although atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is also possible. Other types of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, such as atrial tachycardia or AF, are more likely to occur as the subject ages. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serious ventricular arrhythmias typically occur in older patients with structural heart disease. However, idiopathic VT occasionally occurs in adolescence and many cases of torsades de pointes due to congenital long QT syndrome occur before the age of 20. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Description</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palpitations are described in many ways, but some specific sensations are common and useful for narrowing the differential diagnosis. Thus, it is critical that the patient give a detailed description of the sensation associated with the symptom of palpitation. In particular, it is important to establish the rate and degree of regularity of the palpitations; it may be helpful to have the patient tap out the rhythm with the fingers. It may also be useful for the physician to provide examples of rapid and regular rhythms, rapid and irregular rhythms, slow and regular rhythms, and slow and irregular rhythms. Rapid and regular rhythms are suggestive of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or VT. Rapid and irregular rhythms suggest atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or tachycardia with variable block.</p><p>Other descriptions can also provide helpful information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flip-flopping in the chest &ndash; In some cases the palpitations are sensed as the heart seeming to stop and then start again, producing a pounding or flip-flopping sensation. This type of palpitation is generally caused by supraventricular or ventricular premature contractions. The sensation that the heart has stopped results from the pause following the premature contraction, and the pounding or flipping sensation results from the forceful contraction following the pause (ie, post extrasystolic potentiation of ventricular inotropy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraventricular-premature-beats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraventricular premature beats&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-premature-beats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular premature beats&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid fluttering in the chest &ndash; A feeling of rapid fluttering in the chest often results from a sustained ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia. The regularity or irregularity of the palpitation may indicate the probable arrhythmic etiology; as examples, atrial fibrillation is irregular while sinus tachycardia and AVNRT are regular.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pounding in the neck &ndash; An irregular pounding feeling in the neck is caused by atrioventricular dissociation, with independent contraction of the atria and ventricles, resulting in occasional atrial contraction against a closed tricuspid and mitral valve. This produces cannon A waves, which are intermittent increases in the &quot;A&quot; wave of the jugular venous pulse. Cannon A waves may be seen with ventricular premature contractions, third degree or complete heart block, or ventricular tachycardia (VT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Rapid and regular neck pulsations, which are due to prominent and regular A waves, may be seen as a bulging in the neck, sometimes termed a &quot;frog sign&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The sensation of rapid and regular pounding in the neck is most typical of reentrant supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly AVNRT or atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia due to a preexcitation syndrome. AVNRT is the most common form of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and is three times as common in women as in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the typical form of atrioventricular nodal tachycardia, the atria and ventricles are activated simultaneously at an average rate of <strong>160 to 180</strong> beats per minute; as a result of simultaneous atrial and ventricular contraction, the atria are always contracting against a closed or partially closed mitral and tricuspid valve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-reentrant-tachycardia-avrt-associated-with-an-accessory-pathway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Onset and offset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mode of onset and termination of the palpitations sometimes indicates their cause. Palpitations that occur randomly and episodically and last for an instant are generally due to premature beats, while a gradual onset and offset suggests a sinus tachycardia. Palpitations described as abrupt in onset and termination may be caused by supraventricular or ventricular tachycardias.</p><p>Patients often become adept at terminating their own palpitations with carotid sinus massage or other vagal maneuvers, such as the Valsalva maneuver. This mode of termination is suggestive of supraventricular tachycardias, particularly atrioventricular nodal tachycardia or those using a bypass tract. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-reentrant-tachycardia-avrt-associated-with-an-accessory-pathway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Positional palpitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have a history of AVNRT frequently experience the arrhythmia upon standing up straight after bending over; the arrhythmia may end when lying down.</p><p>Often a patient notes an intermittent pounding sensation while lying in bed, particularly in the supine or left lateral decubitus position. This symptom is commonly the result of supraventricular or ventricular premature beats, which occur more frequently at slow heart rates, as when a person is resting in bed. In the left lateral decubitus position, the apex of the heart is closer to the chest wall, which may account for the greater awareness of palpitations in this position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Palpitations associated with syncope or presyncope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dizziness, presyncope, or syncope may accompany palpitations and should prompt a search for a hemodynamically significant and potentially serious arrhythmia, most importantly VT. Short runs of nonsustained VT can cause syncope as well as a sensation of palpitations.</p><p>Occasionally syncope is associated with a supraventricular tachycardia, particularly at the beginning of the tachycardia. This type of syncope is believed to result from acute vasodilation, rapid heart rate with low cardiac output, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiologies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychiatric illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no optimal screening tool for psychiatric causes of arrhythmia. In one study of 125 outpatients referred for ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring to evaluate a complaint of palpitations, patients with psychiatric disorders were significantly younger and more disabled, somatized more, and had more hypochondriacal concerns about their health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Their palpitations were more likely to last longer than 15 minutes, were accompanied by more ancillary symptoms, were described as more intense, and were associated with more emergency department visits.</p><p>Diagnostic criteria for the major psychiatric disorders associated with palpitations (panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder, somatization, depression) have been established (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73966\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73966 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55612\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55612 \">table 3</a>).

A notable example is the midsystolic click and occasionally murmur associated with mitral valve prolapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Virtually every type of supraventricular arrhythmia, as well as ventricular premature depolarizations and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, has been described with mitral valve prolapse, and palpitations are nearly ubiquitous in the subset of patients with mitral valve prolapse who have the mitral valve prolapse syndrome, even in patients who do not have an identifiable arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of palpitations in this disorder, but it is also associated with ventricular tachycardia.

Thus, when the history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory testing do not establish a definitive diagnosis, additional testing can serve several purposes: to rule out a serious condition; to possible identify a treatable cardiac dysrhythmia (eg, atrial fibrillation); and to reassure the patient.</p><p>Diagnostic testing is recommended for three groups of patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those in whom the initial diagnostic evaluation (history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram) suggests an arrhythmic cause. Testing is particularly important in patients who experience syncope or presyncope in association with palpitations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those who are at high risk for an arrhythmia. Patients are considered at high risk if they have organic heart disease or any myocardial abnormality that can lead to serious arrhythmias, including scar formation from myocardial infarction, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, clinically significant valvular regurgitant or stenotic lesions, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. These disorders have all been shown to be associated with the development of ventricular tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Other high-risk patients are those with a family history of arrhythmia, syncope, or sudden death from cardiac causes, such as from a cardiomyopathy or the long QT syndrome.

Additional diagnostic procedures in high-risk patients include ambulatory or transtelephonic monitoring devices, and ultimately invasive electrophysiologic testing if clinically significant arrhythmias are recognized or are suspected but not recorded by ambulatory monitoring devices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Ambulatory monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ambulatory ECG monitoring devices are the most important tools for the diagnosis of unexplained recurrent palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Such a device is typically implanted in the left pectoral region and stores events when the device is activated automatically according to programmed criteria or manually with magnet application. The ILR is most often used for patients with unexplained syncope, but it may have a role for those in whom other methods have failed to document the cause of palpitations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Ambulatory ECG monitoring'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Holter monitors are inherently limited by the short duration of time available for monitoring. In addition, arrhythmias may be identified on a Holter recording that are unrelated to the palpitations. This was illustrated in a study of 1454 elderly patients aged 60 to 94 years, 8.3 percent of whom complained of palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Arrhythmias, predominantly conduction abnormalities and sinus bradycardia, were found in 12.6 percent. However, the prevalence of palpitations was similar in those with and without arrhythmias. In another study of 518 patients who had 24-hour electrocardiographic recordings, 34 percent had their typical symptoms at a time when the electrocardiogram was normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Continuous loop recorders can be used for longer periods than Holter monitors and, since most patients with palpitations do not have them every day, are more likely to record data during palpitations. Furthermore, symptoms can be directly correlated with the cardiac rhythm since the patient activates the monitor.</p><p>A review of four prospective and two retrospective studies of patients with palpitations found that the diagnostic yield was 66 to 83 percent for continuous loop devices, compared with 33 to 35 percent for Holter monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition, continuous loop recorders have proved more cost effective than Holter monitors for the evaluation of palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/10,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,31</a>].</p><p>Two weeks of transtelephonic monitoring is sufficient to make a diagnosis in the vast majority of patients with palpitations and is less costly than the standard monitoring period of one month. As an example, in a retrospective analysis of 5,052 patients who had undergone event recording with a continuous loop monitor, 87 percent had an initial transmission corresponding to palpitations in the first two weeks of monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. An additional 9 percent of initial transmissions occurred by four weeks of monitoring. In a second report of 105 outpatients referred for placement of a transtelephonic monitor for the evaluation of palpitations, the diagnostic yield was 1.04 diagnoses per patient in week one, 0.15 in week two, and 0.01 diagnoses per patient in week three and beyond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The cost-effectiveness ratio increased from $98 per new diagnosis in week one, to $576 and $5832 in weeks two and three, respectively.</p><p>Thus, the data support two weeks of continuous loop event recording in patients with palpitations. A 24-hour Holter monitor can be used in patients with daily palpitations, particularly if the patient is likely to have trouble activating the loop recorder. An implantable event recorder can be used in selected patients with infrequent but symptomatic palpitations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrophysiologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive cardiac electrophysiology is an established technique for the diagnosis of a suspected arrhythmia and is important for the therapy of certain rhythm abnormalities (eg, supraventricular tachycardia).

A Task Force of the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> has published recommendations for electrophysiologic studies in patients with palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of most sustained supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias causing palpitations involves referral to a specialist trained in the pharmacologic and invasive electrophysiologic management of arrhythmias. Most types of regular supraventricular tachycardias and some types of ventricular tachycardias are now curable with radiofrequency ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p>The most challenging cases of palpitations are those due to benign supraventricular or ventricular ectopy or associated with normal sinus rhythm. We attempt to reassure patients with these benign diagnoses that these rhythms are not life-threatening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-premature-beats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular premature beats&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraventricular-premature-beats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraventricular premature beats&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the rare cases in which the supraventricular or ventricular ectopy proves incapacitating, treatment with beta-blocking medications can be initiated (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> 50 mg daily). The beta blocker may not suppress the arrhythmia, but it can eliminate the associated symptoms and make the patient more comfortable. Antiarrhythmic medications are not recommended, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> because of the associated risks of proarrhythmia.</p><p>In general, radiofrequency ablation of isolated ventricular ectopy is not recommended. However, on rare occasions, ventricular bigeminy can produce palpitations with fatigue and near-syncope on exertion because of a slow effective heart rate and low cardiac output. Radiofrequency ablation may be considered in this circumstance, if the ventricular ectopy has uniform morphologic features and occurs incessantly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Frequent ventricular ectopy'</a>.)</p><p>The management of inappropriate sinus tachycardia deserves special mention. The diagnosis of inappropriate sinus tachycardia can be made after secondary causes, such as hyperthyroidism or anemia, have been excluded and the patient has undergone electrophysiologic testing to rule out other forms of supraventricular tachycardia that may mimic sinus tachycardia, such as right atrial tachycardia and sinus node reentry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The first line of therapy is pharmacologic treatment with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. </p><p>If this strategy fails, radiofrequency ablation or modification of the sinus node can be attempted. However, these treatments are often unrewarding and may result in serious complications, such as complete destruction of the sinus node, requiring permanent pacing, or paralysis of the phrenic nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-palpitations-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].
