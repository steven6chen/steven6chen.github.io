As such, these are often combined and define epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in clinical trials and clinical practice. This topic will consider all three tumors under the heading EOC.</p><p>Despite initial therapy, the majority of women will relapse and require retreatment. The management of relapsed disease is stratified based upon the amount of time that has elapsed between the completion of platinum-based treatment and the detection of relapse, known as the platinum-free interval (PFI) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-line-chemotherapy-for-advanced-stage-iii-or-iv-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-cancer#H760206841\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-line chemotherapy for advanced (stage III or IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal cancer&quot;, section on 'Treatment of recurrent disease'</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a PFI of six months or longer are considered to have &quot;platinum-sensitive&quot; disease.

We prefer sequential single-agent treatment rather than combination therapy. Therefore, our preferred option is single-agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> as the first-line treatment for these patients, especially in those patients who have not previously been treated with paclitaxel for recurrent EOC. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459230024\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who have not previously been treated <strong>specifically</strong> for platinum-resistant disease (ie, first-line therapy), our approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, we utilize single-agent chemotherapy rather than combination chemotherapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients receiving first-line treatment for platinum-resistant recurrent disease, we administer weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>. However, we acknowledge that among patients who were treated with paclitaxel previously, prior toxicities may prohibit its repeated use (eg, persistent neuropathy or prior history of prolonged myelosuppression). (See <a href=\"#H459229618\" class=\"local\">'Paclitaxel'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who progressed on or are not candidates for single-agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> in this setting, we administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegylated-liposomal-doxorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pegylated liposomal doxorubicin</a> (PLD) because of its schedule (ie, every-four-week administration) and lack of typical side effects associated with chemotherapy (eg, little risk of myelosuppression, no risk of alopecia). (See <a href=\"#H459229734\" class=\"local\">'Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For appropriately selected women with platinum-resistant recurrent disease, we administer single-agent chemotherapy plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>. Ideal patients for chemotherapy plus bevacizumab include those patients who have received less than two prior regimens, have not received bevacizumab previously, and have no history of a bowel obstruction within six months.

In an analysis of 1620 patients who had originally participated in a first-line clinical trial, subsequent treatment for recurrent disease resulted in a significant improvement in median overall survival (OS) in the second-line (14 versus 4 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.38, 95% CI 0.32-0.46), third-line (11 versus 3 months, HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.28-0.45), and fourth-line setting (8 versus 3 months, HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.37-0.74) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-treatment-for-relapsed-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer-platinum-resistant-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SINGLE-AGENT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple agents with activity in platinum-resistant EOC, but there is not one universally preferred agent for use in the first- or subsequent-line treatment. A Cochrane systematic review of trials (n = 1323) with platinum-resistant EOC concluded that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegylated-liposomal-doxorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pegylated liposomal doxorubicin</a> (PLD) have similar efficacy, but different patterns of side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-treatment-for-relapsed-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer-platinum-resistant-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A choice among these agents depends upon the clinician's experience, the side effect profile, and prior therapy. In general, we prefer single-agent treatment with PLD because of its schedule (ie, every-four-week administration) and lack of typical side effects associated with chemotherapy (eg, little risk of myelosuppression, no risk of alopecia). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459229618\"><span class=\"h2\">Paclitaxel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Paclitaxel</a> has been shown to be one of the most active agents in EOC, particularly in paclitaxel-na&iuml;ve, platinum-resistant EOC in which response rates range between 13 and 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-treatment-for-relapsed-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer-platinum-resistant-disease/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].

For patients who experience a rising CA 125 within six months of completion of prior treatment, we recommend surveillance rather than chemotherapy because a randomized trial showed no survival benefit to early compared with delayed treatment (ie, treatment initiated based on objective evidence of disease progression). This trial is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum#H1105882\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum&quot;, section on 'CA 125 surveillance'</a>.) </p><p>We suggest the administration of endocrine therapy in patients with relapse by CA 125 alone because these patients are often asymptomatic, and endocrine therapy is a less toxic alternative to chemotherapy, with low-quality evidence that it can keep disease from progressing.

Options for treatment must focus on comfort and palliation (eg, placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrotomy tube to prevent vomiting), as both chemotherapy and surgical options have very limited utility.
