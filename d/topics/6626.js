Although the effects of inadequate perfusion are reversible initially, prolonged hypoxemia leads to the disruption of critical biochemical processes, which if not addressed results in cell death, end-organ failure, and, possibly, death.</p><p>While the classification and underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of neonatal shock are the same as those seen in pediatric and adult shock, the etiology and clinical manifestations vary and are often unique to neonates.

It is manifested by physical findings of tissue hypoperfusion (eg, cold extremities, acrocyanosis, and poor capillary refill), hypotension, and metabolic acidosis. It is important to recognize that hypotension, which is commonly used to define shock states in adults, is generally a late finding of shock in neonates. Shock is often initially reversible, but must be recognized and treated immediately to prevent progression to irreversible organ dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of note, blood pressure (BP) values vary significantly based on gestational age (GA) and postnatal age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110007\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110007 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110015\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110015 \">figure 2</a>), particularly for extremely preterm infants born &lt;28 weeks GA.

It is the product of heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV). SV is the volume of blood pumped out during each cardiac contraction and is dependent on preload, afterload, and ventricular contractility:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">CO = HR x SV</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oxygen content in the arterial blood (CaO</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong><strong>)</strong> depends on the hemoglobin concentration (Hgb), oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>), and, to a much lesser degree, the arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO<sub>2</sub>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">CaO<sub>2</sub> = 1.36 x Hgb x SaO<sub>2</sub> + (0.0031 x PaO<sub>2</sub>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oxygen delivery (DO</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong><strong>)</strong> is the product of CO and the CaO<sub>2</sub>:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">DO<sub>2</sub> = CO x CaO<sub>2</sub></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic vascular resistance (SVR)</strong> is the resistance that the left ventricle must overcome to pump blood through the systemic circulation.

Cellular hypoxia results in a switch to anaerobic metabolism and accumulation of lactic acid. Increasing levels of lactic acid causes metabolic acidosis, which interferes with cell and organ function and, if not addressed, cell death. Tissue hypoperfusion also leads to endothelial dysfunction, stimulation of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cascades, and activation of local humoral processes that disrupt the microcirculation resulting in further tissue injury. If untreated, these processes result in circulatory collapse, major organ failure, and death.</p><p>Shock is classified based on the following underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.

These include physical findings of tissue hypoperfusion (eg, cold extremities, acrocyanosis, and poor capillary refill), and metabolic acidosis. Patients in the early stages of shock may present with normal blood pressure (BP) but with tachycardia and compensatory peripheral vasoconstriction (eg, cold extremities and acrocyanosis). Hypotension is typically found only in the late stages of shock and bradycardia is usually observed in the terminal stage in term infants, but may be an early finding in preterm infants. (See <a href=\"#H2460442240\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2997754284\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL STABILIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stabilization of the patient's hemodynamic status takes precedence over any diagnostic evaluation. Resuscitation should not be delayed to obtain history, perform a physical examination, or obtain laboratory tests. The goals of the initial evaluation of neonatal shock include rapid recognition and correction of circulatory compromise and other life-threatening conditions.</p><p>The following approach is directed to initial stabilization of the hemodynamic status of neonates in shock:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Airway/breathing</strong></span> &ndash; Assess and stabilize the infant's airway and respiratory status, including administration of supplemental oxygen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mechanical ventilation. Neonates in shock generally are in respiratory distress or are apneic and almost always require positive pressure ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation in neonates&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vascular access</strong> &ndash; Vascular access should be established and blood samples obtained for initial testing. If feasible, central lines for frequent blood drawing and consistent vascular access should be considered. Arterial access for invasive BP monitoring should also be considered, but peripheral arterial lines can be difficult to establish in neonates with poor perfusion. (See <a href=\"#H3280272425\" class=\"local\">'Basic laboratory studies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluid resuscitation</strong> &ndash; Initial fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid infusion of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> over 10 to 15 minutes should be performed for neonates with undifferentiated shock. Further aggressive fluid resuscitation is generally needed for patients with hypovolemic or distributive shock. For patients with obstructive shock, initial volume expansion may also be beneficial as it improves cardiac preload. In contrast, fluid expansion may be harmful for infants with cardiogenic shock. Excessive isotonic fluid administration (&gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> in preterm infants is associated with an increased risk of death and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). As a result, assessing the response to the initial fluid bolus (monitoring heart rate [HR], blood pressure [BP], peripheral perfusion) is important to determine if further fluid resuscitation is warranted. (See <a href=\"#H1579169600\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring response'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2781834069\" class=\"local\">'Fluid resuscitation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation</strong> &ndash; Ongoing diagnostic evaluation is performed concomitantly with resuscitative steps including a brief review of the history, physical examination, and obtaining basic laboratory tests (electrolytes, blood gas, complete blood count, lactate, blood culture, renal and liver function tests, and type and cross). In addition, other tests (eg, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram (ECG), or echocardiography) may be indicated based on the history or physical examination.

The empiric antibiotic regimen should include agents active against group B streptococcal and other organisms that cause neonatal sepsis (eg, <em>Escherichia coli</em>). The combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ampicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a> or ampicillin and a third generation cephalosporin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cefotaxime</a>, if available) are potential regimens that provide empiric coverage for these organisms until culture results are available.

The need for transfusion should be revisited throughout their course and once the patient's condition stabilizes, the threshold for transfusion should be raised to avoid unnecessary exposure to blood products. Indications for RBC transfusion in neonates are reviewed in greater detail separately.

If untreated it leads to <span class=\"nowrap\">tissue/cellular</span> damage that results in end-organ failure and, in some cases, death.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The causes of neonatal shock are classified into four pathophysiologic mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110373 \">table 1</a>). However, neonatal shock may be the result of more than one of these processes (multifactorial shock). (See <a href=\"#H952674261\" class=\"local\">'Etiologic classification'</a> above.):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypovolemic shock is due to significant fluid losses (eg fetomaternal bleeding) that impairs cardiac output (CO). (See <a href=\"#H2166438295\" class=\"local\">'Hypovolemic shock'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Distributive shock is due to maldistribution of blood within the microcirculation and regional and global hypoperfusion caused by a severely decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Sepsis is the most common cause of distributive shock. (See <a href=\"#H3705276476\" class=\"local\">'Distributive shock'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cardiogenic shock is due to cardiac dysfunction or arrhythmia resulting in decreased CO. (See <a href=\"#H1039479992\" class=\"local\">'Cardiogenic shock'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obstructive shock is caused by extracardiac disorders (eg, tension pneumothorax) that result in decreased CO. (See <a href=\"#H1277375262\" class=\"local\">'Obstructive shock'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regardless of the etiology, neonates with shock typically present with signs of poor perfusion (cool extremities, acrocyanosis, pallor), tachycardia, and metabolic acidosis. Late signs of shock include bradycardia and hypotension.

However, diagnostic evaluation can be conducted in concert with resuscitative efforts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history, physical examination, and laboratory testing may help determine the underlying cause of shock and guide further management decisions. (See <a href=\"#H2997754284\" class=\"local\">'Initial stabilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of initial stabilization is to improve physiological indicators of poor perfusion.
