However, the terms &quot;Bell's palsy&quot; and &quot;idiopathic facial paralysis&quot; may no longer be considered synonymous, as herpes simplex virus activation is the likely cause of Bell's palsy in most cases. A peripheral facial palsy is a clinical syndrome of many causes, and evaluation requires more than a superficial examination.</p><p>This review will discuss the treatment and prognosis of Bell's palsy (ie, idiopathic facial nerve palsy or facial nerve palsy of suspected viral etiology). Other clinical aspects of this disorder are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bells-palsy-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bell's palsy: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of facial nerve palsy related to Lyme disease is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-lyme-disease#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Facial nerve palsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2641362362\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of pharmacologic therapy for acute idiopathic facial nerve palsy (Bell's palsy) or facial nerve palsy of suspected viral etiology is early short-term oral glucocorticoid treatment. In severe acute cases, combining antiviral therapy with glucocorticoids may improve outcomes. Eye care is important for patients with incomplete eye closure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109357\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109357 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid and antiviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend early treatment with oral glucocorticoids for all patients with idiopathic facial nerve palsy (Bell's palsy) or facial nerve palsy of suspected viral etiology, consistent with current guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Treatment should preferably begin within three days of symptom onset. Our suggested regimen is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (60 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for one week.</p><p>The suspicion that Bell's palsy is caused by herpes simplex virus in most patients led to trials of antiviral therapy. Compared with placebo, these trials found no benefit for antiviral therapy alone. However, it is possible, but not proven, that the addition of antivirals to glucocorticoids is beneficial, particularly for the subgroup of patients with severe facial palsy, defined as House-Brackmann grade IV or higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70562\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70562 \">table 1</a>). Until certainty is reached, we suggest early combined therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (60 to 80 mg per day) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> (1000 mg three times daily) for one week for patients with severe facial palsy at presentation, defined as House-Brackmann grade IV or higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70562\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70562 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The evidence for glucocorticoid and antiviral therapy is presented in the next sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Meta-analyses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of meta-analyses have evaluated trials testing glucocorticoids and antiviral therapy for Bell's palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. The following examples illustrate the range of the findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis involving 18 trials and 2786 patients, treatment with glucocorticoids alone was associated with a reduced risk of unfavorable recovery (relative risk [RR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.87), whereas treatment with antiviral agents alone was not (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.80-1.62) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In pooled data from eight trials, the same meta-analysis found a trend towards a reduced risk of unfavorable recovery for combined antiviral and glucocorticoid treatment compared with glucocorticoid treatment alone, but the outcome just missed statistical significance (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56-1.0).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second meta-analysis of six trials and 1145 patients, there was no significant benefit of combined antiviral and glucocorticoid treatment for achieving at least partial facial muscle recovery (odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 0.83-2.69) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Methodologic differences probably account for the divergent results of these two meta-analyses. Neither excludes the possibility of marginal benefit when antiviral therapy is combined with glucocorticoids. However, the trend towards benefit was driven largely by the smaller, lower quality trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Randomized trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized trials have established the effectiveness of early short-term oral glucocorticoid treatment for idiopathic facial nerve palsy (Bell's palsy) or facial nerve palsy of suspected viral etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>]. In the two highest-quality trials, glucocorticoid treatment alone was effective for Bell's palsy, while antiviral treatment showed no benefit when given alone or when combined with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest trial studied 829 adults with Bell's palsy who were randomly assigned within 72 hours of onset to one of four treatment groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Placebo plus placebo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisolone</a> (60 mg daily for five days, then tapered by 10 mg daily, for a total treatment length of 10 days) plus placebo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Valacyclovir</a> (1000 mg three times daily for seven days) plus placebo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisolone</a> (10 days) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> (seven days).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At one-year follow-up, the time to complete recovery of facial function was significantly shorter for patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> compared with those not treated with prednisolone (hazard ratio [HR] 1.4, 95% CI 1.18-1.64) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In contrast, time to recovery was no different for patients treated or not treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.19). Furthermore, time to recovery with the addition of valacyclovir to prednisolone was no better than with prednisolone alone. In a separate analysis, treatment with prednisolone significantly reduced the proportion of patients at one year with mild and moderate sequelae (ie, facial asymmetry, facial weakness, and synkinesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An earlier trial evaluated 551 adults (age 16 or older) who were recruited within 72 hours after symptom onset and assigned to either 10 days of treatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> (25 mg twice daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> (400 mg five times daily), both prednisolone and acyclovir, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Outcome data were available for 496 patients. The following observations were noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The primary outcome measure, complete recovery of facial function, was significantly more likely for patients assigned to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> than for those not assigned to prednisolone at both three months (83 versus 64 percent, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.44, 95% CI 1.55-3.84) and nine months (94 versus 82 percent, adjusted OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.72-6.44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The corresponding number needed to treat to achieve one additional complete recovery was six and eight at the two time periods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There was no significant difference in the rate of complete facial recovery for patients assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> (400 mg five times daily) compared with those not assigned to acyclovir at either three months (71 versus 76 percent, adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.55-1.32) or nine months (85 versus 91 percent, adjusted OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Similarly, there was no additional benefit of combined acyclovir and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> treatment compared with prednisolone alone.</p><p/><p>The results of other lower quality trials have suggested benefit or a trend towards benefit for antiviral therapy combined with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/11,14,16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,16,19</a>]. The largest such trial randomly assigned 221 patients within seven days of Bell's palsy onset to treatment with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> (500 mg twice daily for five days) plus oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> or placebo plus oral prednisolone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of complete recovery was significantly higher in the combined <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> group than in the placebo plus prednisolone group (97 versus 90 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subgroup analysis found that the benefit of combined therapy correlated with increasing severity of baseline facial palsy.</p><p/><p>The strength of these results is limited by methodologic issues, including lack of blinding among outcome assessors and a relatively high dropout rate of 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1659030158\"><span class=\"h2\">Eye care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In severe cases of Bell's palsy, the cornea may be at risk because of poor eye lid closure and reduced tearing. This may result in corneal drying and abrasion, with an associated risk of visual loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The presence of corneal sensory loss due to concomitant fifth cranial neuropathy, although unusual, increases the risk of corneal trauma and visual loss. Therefore, we recommend protective measures for patients with inadequate eye closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Artificial tears</a> are available without a prescription in liquid, gel, and ointment forms (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dry-eyes#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dry eyes&quot;, section on 'Artificial tears'</a>). Liquid or gel formulations of artificial tears should be applied every hour while the patient is awake, and ointment formulations (eg, Soothe), which contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a> and white petrolatum, should be used at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Protective glasses or goggles should be prescribed. Patches can be used at night, but tape should not be placed directly on the eyelid since the patch could slip and abrade the cornea. Rarely, tarsorrhaphy or temporary implantation of a gold weight into the upper lid is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support interventions such as physical therapies or surgical facial nerve decompression for the treatment of Bell's palsy. Nevertheless, physical therapy is often incorporated into multimodal interventions for patients with incomplete recovery. (See <a href=\"#H2291475177\" class=\"local\">'Management of incomplete recovery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2802179344\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical therapy encompass a host of different interventions for Bell&rsquo;s palsy, including but not limited to exercises, mime therapy, massage, electrical stimulation, acupuncture, heat therapy, biofeedback, and combinations. A systematic review of physical therapy for Bell&rsquo;s palsy updated in 2011 identified 12 controlled trials with 872 subjects, including four trials of electrical stimulation, three of exercises, and five of acupuncture compared or combined with another form of physical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The methodologic quality of the trials ranged from low to moderate; none was high. The following observations were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial exercises did not reduce the proportion of patients with incomplete recovery at six months. One low-quality trial reported that facial exercises reduced the rate of synkinesis (ie, involuntary movement of the ipsilateral face during volitional movement of another area of the face, which is caused by aberrant regeneration of facial nerve fibers) at three months. Another low-quality trial of 34 subjects with persistent facial palsy that lasted more than nine months found that exercises (mime therapy) led to some improvement in facial function at one year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No significant benefit or harm was found from electrical stimulation or acupuncture.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical decompression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The issue of surgical decompression of the facial nerve is mentioned only for discussion, as it is not a currently recommended treatment. A systematic review updated in 2013 found only two small randomized trials comparing surgery and non-surgical control groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The methodologic quality of both trials was very low, and there was no difference in outcome between the treatment groups in either trial. The authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to decide whether surgery for Bell's palsy is beneficial or harmful. Similar conclusions were reached in an earlier systematic review from the American Academy of Neurology that identified four nonrandomized, prospective studies comparing patients treated with surgery versus no surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Permanent unilateral hearing loss is the most common serious side effect among patients undergoing facial nerve decompression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Other risks reported with middle cranial fossa craniectomy include seizures, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, and facial nerve injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>An uncontrolled study suggested that decompression may be of benefit in patients with profound facial nerve dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and surgical middle cranial fossa decompression of the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve has been advocated in patients with motor nerve conduction studies (NCS) that show at least 90 percent degeneration of the facial nerve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bells-palsy-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bell's palsy: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Electrodiagnostic studies'</a>.)</p><p>However, the results of motor NCS cannot dictate when to operate since test results begin to show abnormalities 72 hours after neural degeneration, a time too late for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, surgical decompression should not be undertaken if facial paralysis has been present for 14 or more days, since severe degeneration of the facial nerve is probably irreversible after two to three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2165042737\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of Bell's palsy is related to the severity of the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A simple rule is that clinically incomplete lesions tend to recover. The House-Brackmann grading system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70562\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70562 \">table 1</a>) was devised both as a clinical indicator of severity and also an objective record of progress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. On this scale, grades I and II have good outcomes, grades III and IV characterize moderate dysfunction, and grades V and VI portend a poor result. Other grading systems (eg, the <a href=\"http://sunnybrook.ca/uploads/FacialGradingSystem.pdf&amp;token=EeKzpC1vBGRVIFvyEGlS8JbKt6trOs7JBrbHSE88q8joEHbC2RsKXuqXxLPxIMjKjQagcFptyov0RGj4TbR4Lw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5286\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Sunnybrook facial grading system</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]) are similar and sometimes favored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>].</p><p>Statistically, the natural history without treatment was described in a study of 1011 patients in 1982 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. One-third had an incomplete paralysis, and two-thirds had complete paralysis. Overall, 85 percent showed signs of recovery within three weeks, 71 percent had complete recovery, 13 percent had slight sequelae, and 16 percent had residual weakness, synkinesis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> contracture. Patients with incomplete lesions had a 94 percent rate of return to normal function, while only 60 percent of those with clinically complete lesions returned to normal function. In one report, herpes zoster was associated with more severe paresis and a worse prognosis compared with &quot;idiopathic&quot; Bell's palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The prognosis is favorable if some recovery is seen within the first 21 days of onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A diagnosis of Bell's palsy is doubtful if some facial function, however small, has not returned within three to four months.

Thus, on blinking there is twitching of the angle of the mouth, and on smiling the eye may close or wink. Similarly, with misdirected autonomic fibers, a salivary stimulus may result in excess lacrimation, the syndrome of &quot;crocodile tears.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1368800340\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent attacks of idiopathic facial palsy on either the ipsilateral or contralateral side have been observed 7 to 15 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bells-palsy-treatment-and-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>].

For patients with inadequate eye closure, we recommend proper eye protection measures (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1659030158\" class=\"local\">'Eye care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with idiopathic facial nerve palsy (Bell's palsy) or facial nerve palsy of suspected viral etiology, we recommend early treatment with oral glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Treatment should preferably begin within three days of symptom onset. Our suggested regimen is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (60 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for one week. For the subgroup of patients with severe facial palsy at presentation, defined as House-Brackmann grade IV or higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70562\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70562 \">table 1</a>), we suggest early combined therapy with prednisone (60 to 80 mg per day) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> (1000 mg three times daily) for one week rather than glucocorticoids alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid and antiviral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of facial nerve palsy related to Lyme disease (neuroborreliosis) is discussed elsewhere.

A simple rule is that clinically incomplete lesions tend to recover. The prognosis is favorable if some recovery is seen within the first 21 days of onset. (See <a href=\"#H2165042737\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up is essential for eye care, psychological support, and management of long-term sequelae related to Bell's palsy.
