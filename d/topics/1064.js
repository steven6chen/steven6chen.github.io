Some studies have suggested that these antibodies may serve as markers for specific disease manifestations, including central nervous system (CNS) disease and hepatitis, but other studies have not confirmed these associations. (See <a href=\"#H5856066\" class=\"local\">'Associations with specific manifestations of SLE'</a> below.)</p><p>The specificity, clinical associations, and utility of measuring antiribosomal P protein antibodies are discussed here.

The P proteins, which exhibit molecular weights of 35, 19, and 17 kD, are designated P0, P1, and P2, respectively. The immunodominant epitope in patients with SLE is a shared sequence at the carboxy (C)-termini of the P proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>In their native form, the ribosomal P antigens form a pentamer consisting of one copy of P0 and two copies each of P1 and P2. This complex interacts with the 28S ribosomal RNA molecule to form the ribosomal stalk, including a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) domain involved in the elongation step of protein translation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Monoclonal antibodies to P proteins inhibit binding of elongation factor (EF)-1 alpha and EF-2 to ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>P proteins were initially identified on ribosomes in the cytoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; subsequent studies have also documented epitopes recognized by antiribosomal P protein antibodies on the surface of neuronal, hepatoma, and activated T cells in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The binding of antibodies to these proteins on cell surfaces could have pathogenic significance, given evidence that such antibodies can be internalized, resulting in cellular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17463426\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibodies to ribosomal P proteins produce a finely speckled cytoplasmic staining pattern on a human epithelioma cell, type 2 (HEp-2) cell substrate using indirect immunofluorescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F59670\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59670 \">picture 1</a>). In clinical practice, these antibodies may be detected by immunoblot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or addressable laser bead assay. In these assays, antibodies may be detected using purified native or recombinant antigen or synthetic peptides. A 22-amino acid peptide shared by the three ribosomal P proteins is the major autoantigenic epitope; this portion of the protein can be used to replace the full-length protein in screening assays, without losing sensitivity or specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Another study suggests that excluding amino (N)-terminal epitopes may result in loss of assay sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical significance of antiribosomal P protein antibodies is their specificity for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

They were initially detected in 10 to 20 percent of patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/10,14,15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15,20</a>]; however, other studies, including adult SLE patients from China and Japan and children from the United States and Argentina, have reported higher rates of prevalence (35 to 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/19,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21-23</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An international study involving 11 centers, 947 patients with SLE, and 1113 controls used a mixture of three recombinant ribosomal P polypeptides as the antigenic target in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); the sensitivity and specificity of antiribosomal P protein antibodies for SLE were 21 and 99 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The prevalence at each individual center ranged from a high of 35 percent for patients from China to 8 percent for patients from Canada. None of 208 normal sera used as controls tested positive. The disease controls with positive tests included patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 3 of 284 patients), patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc; 2 of 131), and one patient each with hepatitis C, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), and polymyositis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another multicenter study, which employed an ELISA using the C22 epitope as the antigenic target, showed similar sensitivity and specificity for SLE of 23 and 99 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Testing was negative in healthy blood donors and in patients with RA or Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome (n = 135, 60, and 26, respectively). One patient each with MCTD, limited cutaneous SSc, ulcerative colitis, and polymyalgia rheumatica tested positive.</p><p/><p>Several factors may be responsible for the variability of the prevalence in different populations, including variable ethnic or genetic composition of populations in different studies and differences in regional practice and in patient selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5856066\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATIONS WITH SPECIFIC MANIFESTATIONS OF SLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential association between the presence of antiribosomal phosphorylated protein (P protein) antibodies and specific manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is highly controversial. Antiribosomal P antibodies have been associated in different studies with SLE involving the central nervous system (CNS), liver, kidney, and skin. By contrast, other studies have not demonstrated such associations. Some studies have also suggested that these antibodies are markers for SLE disease activity.</p><p>The same factors that appear to account for differences in the prevalence of antiribosomal P protein antibodies among different groups of patients with SLE are likely to result in the variability in the associations with different clinical manifestations. Additionally, small sample sizes in many of the positive studies described below and differences in methods for detection of antibody may also be important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Central nervous system disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiribosomal P protein testing has limited diagnostic value for CNS SLE and is not helpful in differentiating clinical subtypes of CNS SLE. Some studies have suggested an association between the presence of antiribosomal P protein antibodies and neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE, particularly psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/15,17,19,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,19,24,25</a>]; however, other studies do not support such an association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/18,20,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20,26,27</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of diagnostic utility of antiribosomal P protein antibodies for CNS SLE is supported by a meta-analysis of observational data from 1537 patients with SLE from 14 centers in Europe, Asia, and South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The presence of antibodies to ribosomal P protein had an overall sensitivity and specificity for neuropsychiatric lupus of 26 and 80 percent, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were similar for psychosis, mood disorder, or both (27 and 80 percent) and for other diffuse manifestations (24 and 80 percent). Positive testing did not distinguish between different manifestations of CNS SLE, and results between different centers showed significant heterogeneity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study involving 116 patients with SLE, no association of antiribosomal P protein antibodies with neuropsychiatric SLE was observed; the sensitivity and specificity of antiribosomal P protein antibodies for neuropsychiatric disease were 21 and 13 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association of antiribosomal P protein antibodies with liver disease has been suggested in several reports, including two small case-control studies, following an initial case report of a patient with lupus in whom antiribosomal P protein antibodies were produced soon after the development of chronic active hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study found a higher number of patients with SLE-related liver disease among 20 patients with SLE and antiribosomal P protein antibodies than among controls with SLE but without such antibodies (7 of 20 patients versus 1 of 20 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Antibodies to ribosomal P proteins were not found in the sera of 59 patients with autoimmune liver diseases, including chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis (previously referred to as &ldquo;primary biliary cirrhosis&rdquo;), and sclerosing cholangitis in the absence of lupus, suggesting that the autoantibodies were not the result of immune-related hepatic injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report found a higher number of patients with antiribosomal P protein antibodies among patients with SLE-related hepatitis compared with a control group of SLE patients without liver disease (6 of 6 patients versus 2 of 20 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Hepatitis was present in only 3 percent of the patients in the large lupus cohort from which most of the patients for the study were drawn.</p><p/><p>Several large studies have had too few patients with liver disease to draw any firm conclusions regarding this association, and further studies are required for confirmation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/18,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiribosomal P protein antibodies have been associated with the presence and activity of lupus nephritis in several mostly small studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/30,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33-35</a>]; however, other reports have failed to confirm these observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiribosomal-p-protein-antibodies/abstract/15,20,27,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20,27,32</a>].
