A 2006 consensus conference suggested that the potentially pejorative terms &quot;pseudohermaphrodite,&quot; &quot;hermaphrodite,&quot; and &quot;intersex&quot; be replaced by the diagnostic category &quot;disorders of sex development&quot; (DSD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although the term DSD has been accepted by the medical community, patients and support groups question its usefulness and appropriateness based on three criticisms: first, that DSD is an overly broad term that applies to conditions in which no <span class=\"nowrap\">sexual/gender</span> disruption are expected (eg, Turner syndrome, Trisomy X, many females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia [CAH], and others); second, that the use of the word 'disorder' is seen as pejorative by some; and third, that an umbrella term like DSD lacks sufficient specificity to be helpful diagnostically, and is therefore unnecessary. Many of these groups do not accept the DSD designation and feel that it should be abandoned by the medical community. Until a consensus is reached on this issue, we will use the term DSD but will employ it only in relation to those patients in whom there is altered physical sexual differentiation (conditions previously captured by the term &quot;intersex&quot;). Many of these individuals present as newborns with an atypical genital appearance often termed &quot;ambiguous genitalia.&quot; We will not use DSD to refer to conditions in which <span class=\"nowrap\">genital/gender</span> discordance is not expected, such as Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, undescended testes, or most forms of hypospadias. </p><p>DSDs with genital abnormalities sufficient to prompt evaluation occur in approximately one in 1000 to 4500 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sexual-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal sexual development&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In early fetal development, both XX and XY fetuses have similar reproductive structural anlage; this period is referred to as the sexually indifferent phase of sexual development. This ambisexual state continues until the formation of the bipotential gonad at seven weeks, when fetuses bearing a Y chromosome begin developing testes, thereby becoming sexually distinct from fetuses without a Y chromosome. Normal ovarian development also requires active genetic pathways. Thereafter, gonadal differentiation and function determines the genital phenotype. Multiple genes contribute to normal sexual differentiation; mutations in these genes can lead to various DSDs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81145%7EPEDS%2F56975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81145 graphicRef56975 \">table 1A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonads</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial, sexually indifferent phase of gonad formation begins at five weeks of gestation with the development of paired gonadal ridges.

This test should also be considered in term infants with bilateral nonpalpable gonads and apparently normal male genitalia because very rarely females with 21-hydroxylase deficiency have severe virilization and male-typical genitalia. CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of atypical genitalia in females and can lead to life-threatening adrenal insufficiency within the first weeks of life. Because of the possibility for adrenal insufficiency, serum electrolytes should also be measured at the time of presentation, and then regularly until CAH is either confirmed or excluded. Neonatal screening for 21-hydroxylase deficiency is routinely performed in many countries and all US states. However, because of the risk of adrenal crisis, any infant presenting with atypical genitalia should have a rapid and extensive evaluation for CAH as described above, without waiting for the results of the newborn screen.

The <em>SRY</em> gene is a critical factor in testicular development and usually coincides with the presence of a Y chromosome. The presence of <em>SRY</em> in an individual with 46,XX karyotype indicates <em>SRY</em> translocation; absence of <em>SRY</em> in an individual with a 46,XY karyotype suggests <em>SRY</em> deletion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other steroid metabolites</strong> &ndash; All infants with atypical genitalia should also be tested for less common types of CAH by measuring dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 17-hydroxypregnenolone, and 11-deoxycortisol.

This is because these ultrasensitive methods provide remarkably different values compared with immunoassays performed without extraction and careful preparation. This fact has greatly confused the literature. At birth, gonadal steroid production is suppressed by high levels of maternal sex steroids, but a large quantity of cross-reacting steroids from the maternal circulation and the fetal adrenal may influence the results of the relatively nonspecific unextracted testosterone immunoassay. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Levels of testosterone begin to rise at about a week of age in full-term male infants at the start of the &quot;minipuberty&quot; seen in male infants. Values usually peak between one to three months and the male minipuberty ends by about six months of age. Premature infants may take longer to enter the &quot;minipuberty&quot; phase. Because of the large amount of maternal-placental steroids, as well as steroids from the overactive &quot;fetal adrenal,&quot; other steroid levels important in the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia may be confusing in the first several days of life. However, after three to four days of age, chromatographically-extracted steroid values should be useful diagnostically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

However, it can be seen with an XY karyotype, a mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">XX/XY</span> karyotype, or various other sex chromosome patterns.

Some DSDs present with an atypical genital appearance that does not permit gender declaration at birth, and this physical appearance is often termed &quot;ambiguous genitalia.&quot; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of infants with atypical genitalia should be undertaken as soon as possible. This is because congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the most common cause of DSD, can be life-threatening. In addition, DSD is perceived as disturbing by most families, and calls for immediate sensitive and professional counseling and psychosocial support. (See <a href=\"#H25315825\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On physical examination, key clinical features of infants with DSD can include bilaterally nonpalpable testes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73353\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73353 \">picture 1</a>), microphallus, scrotal or perineal hypospadias, clitoromegaly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64870%7EPEDS%2F76693\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64870 graphicRef76693 \">picture 2A-B</a>), posterior labial fusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51835\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51835 \">picture 3</a>), or palpable gonad or gonads in the labioscrotal folds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78743\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78743 \">picture 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial laboratory testing should include measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone as an initial screen for the possibility of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and a karyotype with a probe for <em>SRY</em> (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome), using fluorescence <em>in situ</em> hybridization (FISH) in order to direct further studies. The <em>SRY</em> gene is a critical factor in testicular development and usually coincides with the presence of a Y chromosome. All infants with atypical genitalia should also be tested for less common types of CAH by measuring serum electrolytes, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 11-deoxycortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107536\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107536 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic and abdominal ultrasonography should be performed to determine whether gonads, uterus, and vagina are present, and can sometimes assist in the identification of adrenal hyperplasia when present. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The results of the examination and initial laboratory testing should permit classification of the infant into one of three broad categories: 46,XX DSD, 46,XY DSD, or sex chromosome DSD. The infant can then be further evaluated to determine the nature of the underlying disorder within each of these categories. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In 46,XX (<em>SRY</em>-negative) infants, the most common cause of atypical genitalia is CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency; the differential diagnosis also includes 11-beta hydroxylase deficiency (a less common cause of CAH), 3-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency, gestational hyperandrogenism, testicular DSD, and ovotesticular DSD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70570\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70570 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'46,XX DSD'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In 46,XY (SRY-positive) infants, the differential diagnosis includes uncommon forms of CAH, most of which can present with adrenal crisis (except for 17-alpha hydroxylase deficiency in which symptomatic adrenal insufficiency is rare) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107536\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107536 \">table 3</a>). In addition to measurements of 17-hydroxypregnenolone, the evaluation should include measurement of serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH, also known as M&uuml;llerian inhibiting substance), testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and androstenedione (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66241\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66241 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'46,XY DSD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the cause of the DSD remains unclear after the workup outlined above, further evaluation may include a high-coverage chromosomal microarray (CMA), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> whole exome or whole genome sequencing. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of these infants, which is critical and often controversial in the absence of well-defined outcome-based guidelines, requires a multidisciplinary team including specialists from pediatric endocrinology, genetics, pediatric <span class=\"nowrap\">surgery/urology,</span> and psychology or social work.
