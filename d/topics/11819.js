Lung cancer happens when normal lung cells change into abnormal cells and grow out of control (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67527\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67527 \">figure 1</a>). There are different types of lung cancer. Some types grow faster than others.</p><p>Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer. It does not usually grow as fast as another type of lung cancer called small cell lung cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717534\"><span class=\"h1\">What is lung cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out how far in your body a cancer has spread. To describe how far a person's non-small cell lung cancer has spread, doctors call it stage 1, 2, 3, or 4. These are also written as stage I, II, III, or IV.</p><p>Sometimes, staging can be tricky. For example, your doctor might think that you have stage 1 or stage 2 cancer. But after you have surgery, your doctor might check the tissues you had removed and discover that you really have stage 3 cancer.</p><p>Some of the main differences between the stages include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In stage 1, the lung cancer is in either the left or right lung. It has not spread outside the lung or to any lymph nodes. (Lymph nodes are bean-shaped organs that are part of the body's infection-fighting system.) Stage 1 cancers are usually small.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In stage 2, the cancer has spread to other parts of the lung, such as lymph nodes in the lung or the lining around the lung. Stage 2 cancers can be different sizes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In stage 3, the cancer might be large. Or it might have spread to lymph nodes in the middle of the chest, between the left and right lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In stage 4, the cancer has spread to the other lung or to other parts of the body, such as the brain or bones. Also, lung cancer is described as stage 4 if it causes fluid to collect around the outside of the lungs.</p><p/><p>Your treatment will depend a lot on the stage of your lung cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717541\"><span class=\"h1\">How are stage 1 and stage 2 non-small cell lung cancers treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with stage 1 or stage 2 non-small cell lung cancer are usually first treated with surgery to remove the cancer. To remove the cancer, a doctor might remove part of a lung. Or he or she might need to remove the whole lung. (People who have 1 lung removed can use their other lung to breathe.)</p><p>People with stage 1 lung cancer might not need any other treatment after surgery. But people with stage 2 lung cancer usually need more treatment after surgery. This can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells. Some people who do not want surgery or who cannot have surgery have radiation therapy instead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p>Sometimes people with stage 1 or stage 2 are treated with radiation therapy rather than surgery, if they have other problems that prevent them from having surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717548\"><span class=\"h1\">How is stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can treat stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer in different ways. Treatment depends on where the cancer is, how big it is, and which treatments a person has already had.</p><p>People with stage 3 lung cancer usually have 1 or more of the following treatments:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p/><p>Doctors also treat another type of lung cancer, called a &quot;Pancoast tumor,&quot; in these ways. A Pancoast tumor is a lung cancer that grows in the top part of the lung.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717555\"><span class=\"h1\">How is stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no treatment that will cure stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer. But different treatments can reduce symptoms and help people live longer. People with stage 4 lung cancer can have 1 or more of the following treatments:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted therapy &ndash; These are medicines that work only for cancers with certain characteristics. Your doctor might test your tumor to see if you have a kind of lung cancer that would respond to these medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunotherapy &ndash; Immunotherapy is the term doctors use to describe medicines that work with the body's infection-fighting system to stop cancer growth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove a cancer growth that is outside of the lungs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for symptoms caused by the cancer &ndash; For example, if you have trouble breathing because fluid has collected around your lungs, your doctor can drain the fluid to help you breathe more easily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717562\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor will check every so often to see if your lung cancer has come back. Follow-up tests usually include exams and imaging tests such as chest X-rays or CT scans. Imaging tests can create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717569\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the lung cancer comes back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the lung cancer comes back, you might have chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation, or surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H526906789\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I smoke?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you smoke, you should try to quit. People who survive lung cancer have a greater chance of getting lung cancer again if they smoke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717576\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to follow all your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for lung cancer involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have and when.</p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Anytime you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717703\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lung cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-small-cell-lung-cancer-treatment-stage-i-to-iii-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Non-small cell lung cancer treatment; stage I to III cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-small-cell-lung-cancer-treatment-stage-iv-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Non-small cell lung cancer treatment; stage IV cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-risks-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lung cancer risks, symptoms, and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-prevention-and-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lung cancer prevention and screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-cell-lung-cancer-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Small cell lung cancer treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
