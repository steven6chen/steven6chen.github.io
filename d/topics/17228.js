Their clinical importance is primarily related to the need to exclude thyroid cancer, which is present in 4 to 6.5 percent of thyroid nodules overall but up to 15 percent of thyroid nodules in the older patient population. If a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal, the next step in the evaluation of a thyroid nodule is a palpation or ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy.</p><p>This topic will review the techniques, utility, limitations, and complications of percutaneous thyroid biopsies. Ultrasound-guided thyroid biopsy, an atlas of cytopathologic findings, and overview of the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid nodules are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thyroid biopsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atlas-of-thyroid-cytopathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atlas of thyroid cytopathology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most common methods used to obtain tissue from thyroid nodules are fine-needle aspiration (FNA), using a syringe, and fine-needle capillary sampling (FNC), which is done without aspiration. Biopsy can be guided by palpation only or by ultrasound.</p><p>Other techniques include large-needle aspiration biopsy and cutting-needle biopsy. The latter has shown to be particularly useful for repetitive nondiagnostic FNAs. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Other techniques'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Fine-needle aspiration biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FNA is a simple and safe office procedure in which tissue samples are obtained for cytologic examination. FNA is performed with or without local <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], by repetitively moving a 23- to 27-gauge (most commonly 25- or 27-gauge) needle through the nodule. The needle is attached to a 10 mL syringe that may be contained in a holder designed to facilitate the application of constant or intermittent suction. The aspirated material is smeared directly on slides, fixed, and stained, or collected in a liquid preservative from which thin-layer preparations are made. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Procedure'</a> below.)</p><p>With experience, adequate samples can be obtained in 90 to 97 percent of aspirations of solid nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. It is more difficult to obtain adequate specimens from nodules with extensive cystic degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fine-needle capillary sampling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FNC (also called fine-needle nonaspiration biopsy) is a variation of FNA in which the sample is obtained by repetitively moving within the nodule a 25- to 27-gauge needle that is not attached to a syringe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. After the needle is removed from the nodule, a syringe containing air is used to express the sample on a slide, which is smeared, stained, and submitted for cytologic interpretation. An FNA done with the syringe attached to the needle but with no negative aspiration pressure provides similar results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">FNA versus FNC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The negative aspiration pressure used for FNA may result in more tissue damage and bleeding than FNC. This is a potential problem since blood and fibrin can obscure cells and therefore limit the ability to interpret the specimen.</p><p>The relative efficacy of these procedures was evaluated in a study of 104 thyroid aspirates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The specimens obtained by FNA were significantly more likely to be nondiagnostic than those obtained by FNC (16 versus 6 percent). In a second report, the percentage of nondiagnostic samples at a variety of body sites was the same with both techniques, but the cytologic smears obtained with FNC were of higher quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In practice, endocrinologists frequently use a combination of the FNA and FNC techniques (and may refer to the combined procedure as simply FNA). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Choice of technique'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound guidance is used for the majority of thyroid FNAs. The procedure and supportive data are presented separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thyroid biopsy&quot;</a>). When ultrasound is not available and the nodule is palpable, the above techniques (FNA, FNC) can be used by fixing the nodule between the fingers of one hand and inserting the needle with the other.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other techniques</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutting (core)-needle biopsy &ndash; The use of cutting-needle biopsies to obtain a core of tissue for histopathologic analysis is an alternative to FNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. It is almost never the initial procedure of choice, because of a higher risk of bleeding and increased patient discomfort. Unlike FNA, which samples many areas of a nodule, a cutting needle provides only a single core. However, a repeat biopsy with histopathology may provide better information about thyroid architecture in lesions read as follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS) or suspicious for follicular neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and this procedure may be useful for suspected lymphoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The major utility of core-needle biopsy is after one or more nondiagnostic FNAs. In one study of patients who had one nondiagnostic FNA, a core-needle biopsy provided diagnostic results in 74 percent of patients while a repeat FNA provided a result in only 52 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. After two nondiagnostic FNAs, the core needle provided a result in 86 versus 29 percent for FNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. We routinely obtain ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsies in patients with two nondiagnostic FNAs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large-needle aspiration biopsy &ndash; Large-needle aspiration biopsy is similar to FNA but uses larger needles ranging from 21- to 15-gauge. The specimen is expressed into a tube, and a cell block is prepared for histopathology. The technique has been associated with a lower rate of inadequate specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, there have been concerns about pain and bleeding because of the larger needle used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This procedure is not commonly used but is another option when repetitive FNA is nondiagnostic.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommends FNA as the procedure of choice for evaluating thyroid nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In practice, endocrinologists frequently use a combination of the FNA and FNC techniques. The author of this topic typically does four passes with a 25- or 27-gauge needle, some with and some without suction. In a very small minority of patients, if the sample is scant, the author uses a 21-gauge needle during FNA. A 1 or 1&frac12; inch needle is typically used. The role and value of ultrasound guidance is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thyroid biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a simple outpatient office procedure that requires no advanced preparation; many patients undergo FNA at their initial visit with an endocrinologist. It is usually performed on a standard examination table in the supine position with a pillow placed under the patient's shoulders to allow for increased neck extension. We usually administer a local anesthetic. For children and adults unable to cooperate with the procedure, conscious sedation may be used.</p><p>If FNA is scheduled, drugs that inhibit platelet function (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>) should ideally be discontinued five to seven days in advance to reduce the risk of bleeding. However, these drugs should not be discontinued if it places the patient at high risk of a complication, and we generally do not reschedule the procedure if the patient did not discontinue these drugs. Anticoagulant agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> are also preferably discontinued four to five days before FNA. However, nodules that can readily be compressed against the trachea to achieve hemostasis can be safely aspirated despite anticoagulation, using a 27-gauge needle and a minimum number of passes. Some clinicians feel that the procedure is safer when the international normalized ratio (INR) is &lt;2.0.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FNA is a simple and safe procedure that has reduced the percentage of patients undergoing unnecessary thyroidectomy. Local pain and hematomas are the most common complications, while serious adverse events are rare. This was illustrated in a systematic review of 13 studies including 18,156 individuals undergoing thyroid biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> discomfort were minor, transient, and well tolerated, but several studies reported subsets of patients (2 to 8 percent) with moderate pain lasting up to several days. Pain was more common when deep-seated, nonpalpable nodules were biopsied, but the procedure rarely had to be discontinued because of patient discomfort. Local <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> anesthesia can help minimize pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was inconsistency in the reported frequency of <span class=\"nowrap\">hemorrhage/hematomas</span> during or after thyroid biopsy with a range of 0.3 to 26 percent. Small- to moderate-sized hematomas were managed with cold compresses and almost always resolved spontaneously within several days. Massive hematoma with airway obstruction was seen in only a few cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other complications are rare and include acute transient thyroid swelling, infection, tracheal puncture, needle track seeding (ie, tumor implantation), and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury with vocal cord paralysis. In another series, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury occurred in 4 out of 10,974 biopsies (0.036 percent), which resolved in all cases within six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>Complications following core-needle biopsy were reported to be 0.81 percent among 6,687 ultrasound-guided biopsies in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Four patients had serious complications including massive hemorrhage, voice change, and pseudoaneurysm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1929081\"><span class=\"h1\">SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall accuracy of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) exceeds 95 percent. The false-negative rate of a benign interpretation is 0 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/6,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23</a>]. In one series, patients with a cytologic benign diagnosis had a 90 percent probability of benign disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. When confirmed with repeat FNA, the probability increased to 98 percent.</p><p>The positive predictive value of a malignant interpretation is 97 to 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. As an example, in a report of 2587 sequential patients evaluated by thyroid ultrasound, 3589 nodules were aspirated under ultrasound guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The cytologic diagnoses positive for malignancy and no malignant cells were 97 and 99.7 percent predictive, respectively. In a similar report of 4703 FNA samples, the sensitivity and specificity of thyroid FNA for the diagnosis of malignancy were 94 and 98.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, these sensitivity and specificity data are not applicable to follicular neoplasms. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Follicular neoplasm (microfollicular)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are six major categories of results that are obtained based upon fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F106281\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106281 \">table 1</a>), each of which indicates a different subsequent evaluation and management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F90863\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef90863 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The cytopathologic changes are reviewed briefly below and discussed and displayed in more detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atlas-of-thyroid-cytopathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atlas of thyroid cytopathology&quot;</a>). The evaluation and management of thyroid nodules are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Nondiagnostic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nondiagnostic rate varies from 3 to 10 percent at experienced centers. It is critical that the absence of malignant cells not be interpreted as a negative biopsy if no follicular tissue is obtained. For nondiagnostic biopsy results, we typically repeat the FNA biopsy under ultrasound guidance. This is consistent with the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A cutting-needle biopsy under ultrasound guidance may also help after repetitive negative FNAs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This category includes normal thyroid tissue, nodules from adenomatous or multinodular goiters, chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis, or subacute granulomatous thyroiditis.</p><p>Normal thyroid tissue, nodules from adenomatous or multinodular goiters, and some true monoclonal tumors can have a macrofollicular pattern on cytology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76239%7EENDO%2F64419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76239 graphicRef64419 \">picture 1A-B</a>). This pattern may also be referred to as adenomatoid, hyperplastic, macrofollicular, or colloid adenomas. Cytology of macrofollicular nodules may show both intact macrofollicles and macrofollicles that have been broken apart, forming a flat sheet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70424\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70424 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atlas-of-thyroid-cytopathology#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atlas of thyroid cytopathology&quot;, section on 'Benign (macrofollicular) cytology'</a>.)</p><p>The correct cytologic diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis can be challenging. Thus, FNA should be avoided if the diagnosis can be made on clinical grounds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74981\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74981 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atlas-of-thyroid-cytopathology#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atlas of thyroid cytopathology&quot;, section on 'Hashimoto's thyroiditis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Subacute, granulomatous thyroiditis (also called subacute or de Quervain's thyroiditis) is usually a clinical diagnosis. This disorder is typically a viral or postviral syndrome characterized by fever, malaise, and an exquisitely tender thyroid gland. Because the gland may be quite firm, concern about cancer may lead to FNA. Multinucleated giant cells, macrophages, and degenerated follicular cells are seen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute thyroiditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypia of undetermined significance or follicular lesion of undetermined significance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This classification was proposed by the National Cancer Institute Thyroid Fine-Needle Aspiration State of the Science Conference (&quot;Bethesda Conference&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/5,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,23</a>]. It was proposed for lesions that are not convincingly benign but do not have definitive features of a follicular neoplasm and are not highly suspicious of malignancy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AUS &ndash; The category atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) includes lesions with mild nuclear atypia and lesions with extensive oncocytic (H&uuml;rthle cell) change but not enough to be classified as H&uuml;rthle-cell neoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70424\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70424 \">table 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FLUS &ndash; Follicular lesions of undetermined significance (FLUS) are those with a mixed macrofollicular and microfollicular pattern where the proportion of microfollicles and macrofollicles is similar and specimens that are compromised because of poor fixation or obscuring blood. Nodules with features of both macrofollicular fragments and microfollicular lesions are common, especially in nodular goiters.</p><p/><p>The conference intended that no more than 7 percent of preparations would fall into this category, but the use of this term by cytopathologists has been variable, with some centers reporting its use in up to 29 percent of cytology readings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In one multicenter analysis, the introduction of the FLUS or AUS category to diagnostic cytopathology reports resulted in a dramatic increase in surgical referrals from 9 to 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The risk of malignancy with this cytologic classification ranges from 5 to 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/5,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28</a>]. While the Bethesda classification and most analyses have combined AUS and FLUS into one category, other analyses suggest a higher malignancy risk for AUS than FLUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, the ultimate usefulness of this classification requires further study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It should be noted that there may be substantial variability among cytopathologists in classifying FNA cytology in this category (AUS or FLUS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In one study, second review changed the Bethesda classification in 32 percent of thyroid aspirates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Thus, a second review of indeterminate biopsies (FLUS, AUS, or follicular neoplasm) may be warranted, especially at low-volume centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Follicular neoplasm (microfollicular)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The category of neoplasm includes microfollicular or cellular adenomas. Microfollicular or cellular neoplasms may represent benign adenomas, autonomously functioning (benign) adenomas, or well-differentiated follicular or follicular variant of papillary cancers of the thyroid. As many as 15 to 30 percent of all biopsies are classified as follicular neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/5,6,25,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,25,31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atlas-of-thyroid-cytopathology#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atlas of thyroid cytopathology&quot;, section on 'Follicular neoplasm/microfollicular cytology'</a>.)</p><p>All thyroid biopsy techniques are limited by their inability to distinguish differentiated thyroid cancer from microfollicular or cellular adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Thus, the term indeterminate is still widely used to describe these lesions. From 15 to 25 percent of microfollicular or cellular adenomas (follicular neoplasms) prove to be cancers, depending upon the cytologic pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/5,6,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,25</a>]. Occasionally the follicular cells of a microfollicular lesion will have the cytologic features of papillary cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer with biopsy results in this category are most commonly the follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer. Since this diagnosis depends primarily upon cytologic features, the preoperative FNA is more accurate than an intraoperative frozen section at predicting malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=papillary-thyroid-cancer#H145637637\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Papillary thyroid cancer&quot;, section on 'Variant forms'</a>.)</p><p>A diagnosis of follicular cancer is made on the basis of capsular or vascular invasion, which cannot be identified in specimens obtained by FNA. Thus, most patients with nonautonomous microfollicular adenomas should either undergo surgery with pathology evaluation for capsular or vascular invasion or have further evaluation of the nodule with molecular analysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-thyroid-nodules-with-indeterminate-cytology#H3088942949\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology&quot;, section on 'Molecular markers'</a>.)</p><p>If excised, in the absence of capsular or vascular invasion (on surgical histology), the lesion is classified as a benign adenoma. Postsurgical evaluation reveals a malignancy rate of approximately 6 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. The difficulty in accurately diagnosing malignancy in a microfollicular adenoma is illustrated by a pathologic re-review of 185 follicular neoplasms excised 10 years previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Twenty-five percent had a change in diagnosis: 35 from benign to malignant and 11 from malignant to benign; the most common change in diagnosis was from benign to follicular variant papillary cancer.</p><p>Several approaches are currently in use to improve upon cytology alone for the assessment of follicular lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>]. The routine use of molecular analysis on indeterminate FNA aspirates (follicular neoplasm, AUS, FLUS) reduces substantially the number of patients who require diagnostic thyroid surgery. There are two approaches to the molecular characterization of FNA aspirates that are commercially available in the United States: identification of particular molecular markers of malignancy, such as <em>BRAF</em> and <em>RAS</em> mutational status, and use of high-density genomic data for molecular classification (an FNA-trained mRNA classifier). The use of molecular markers in the assessment of patients with cytologic results showing <span class=\"nowrap\">FLUS/AUS</span> or follicular neoplasm is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-thyroid-nodules-with-indeterminate-cytology#H3088942949\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology&quot;, section on 'Molecular markers'</a>.)</p><p>Other approaches are also under investigation. As an example, the utility of positron emission tomography (PET) scans was evaluated in three studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. All of the thyroid cancers (n = 15, 7, and 11, respectively) concentrated 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), while 100 percent, 34 percent, and 61 percent of benign nodules (n = 21, 38, and 31, respectively) concentrated FDG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. In one meta-analysis, the authors found that PET negativity was able to exclude the diagnosis of cancer if the lesion was &gt;1.5 cm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Additional data are needed to determine if PET negative nodules with cytology consistent with a follicular neoplasm can be safely observed.</p><p>The management of thyroid nodules with FNA cytology showing FLUS or AUS and follicular neoplasm is reviewed in detail separately.

However, in one study, the risk of malignancy in microfollicular oxyphil-cell lesions was twice that of nonoxyphil lesions (32 versus 16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. H&uuml;rthle cells are large, polyclonal cells with abundant oxyphilic cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60286\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60286 \">picture 3</a>).

The architecture is papillary, the cells are large, their cytoplasm has a &quot;ground glass&quot; appearance, nucleoli are prominent, and the nuclei demonstrate clefts and grooves, and intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71385\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71385 \">picture 4</a>). Psammoma bodies and dense &quot;sticky&quot; colloid may also be seen. However, the follicular variant of papillary cancer may be interpreted as a microfollicular lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Follicular neoplasm (microfollicular)'</a> above.)</p><p>Cytologists will usually recognize FNAs from medullary thyroid cancer as suspicious but will not always make the diagnosis preoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The cells frequently disperse and are characterized by eccentrically placed nuclei and cytoplasmic tails. Immunocytologic staining for calcitonin confirms medullary cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56242 \">picture 5</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary thyroid cancer: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Aggressive lymphomas are readily diagnosed based upon clinical findings and lymphocytes on FNA or core-needle biopsy. However, low-grade lymphomas may be difficult to distinguish from Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Virtually all thyroid lymphomas originate within Hashimoto's thyroiditis; as a result, sampling error is also a concern. Flow cytometry and immunocytochemical studies may be useful and may require larger fragments of tissue from a cutting-needle biopsy. The patient may be spared surgery if the diagnosis can be made on needle biopsy, although many pathologists prefer tissue obtained from an open biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical suspicion and cytology demonstrating marked pleomorphism, bizarre giant cells, and spindle cells characterize anaplastic cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaplastic-thyroid-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaplastic thyroid cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Renal cell is the most common cancer metastatic to the thyroid. Colorectal, lung, breast, sarcoma, melanoma, and uterine cancer are among the other more common cancers that metastasize to the thyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-biopsy/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. If uncertainty exists, thyroglobulin staining as well as other markers may help determine the origin of the cells. If the underlying cancer diagnosis is known, specific antibodies can be used for immunohistochemical analysis.</p><p>A diagnosis of follicular cancer is made on the basis of capsular or vascular invasion, which cannot be identified in specimens obtained by FNA.

If a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal, the next step in the evaluation of a thyroid nodule is a palpation or ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy.
