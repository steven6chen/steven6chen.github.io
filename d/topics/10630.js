(The plant is also called marijuana.) In the US, marijuana is usually sold in the form of leaves and buds. In Europe, a different form of marijuana is more common. It is called &quot;hashish&quot; and is made from a sticky substance that comes from the plant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5393406\"><span class=\"h1\">What does marijuana do to the brain and body?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Marijuana can make you feel happy and relaxed. It can also make you feel less anxious, tense, and depressed. But it does bad things, too. It makes it hard to focus or remember things, or to think clearly. Plus, it slows your reaction time and impairs your judgement.</p><p>Marijuana can also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make your heart race</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raise your blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make you breathe faster</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make your eyes red</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make your mouth dry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make you hungry</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5393413\"><span class=\"h1\">Who uses marijuana?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Marijuana use is common worldwide. About 4 percent of people ages 15 to 64 in the world have used it in the last year. Younger people are more likely than older people to use it, and men are more likely than women to use it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5393420\"><span class=\"h1\">Does marijuana have any medical benefits?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Marijuana might help ease pain and other symptoms caused by cancer or cancer treatment. It might also help with the symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Some medicines are made from the same active ingredients that are in marijuana.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H793809536\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cannabis use disorder?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cannabis use disorder is basically the medical term for marijuana addiction. People used to think that marijuana was not addictive, but that turns out not to be true. Marijuana addiction does exist, and it can be mild to severe.</p><p>People with marijuana addiction have 2 or more of the following problems. The more of these they have, the more severe their disorder.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They end up using more marijuana than they planned to, or they use it for longer than they planned to.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They wish they could cut down on drugs, but they can't.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They spend a lot of time trying to get drugs, getting high, or recovering from being high.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They crave or have a strong desire or urge to use marijuana.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of their marijuana use, they often don't do things that are expected of them, such as go to work or school, remember family events, and clean their home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They keep using marijuana even if it causes or worsens problems in their relationships or interactions with other people.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They stop or cut back on important social, work, or fun activities they used to do.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They keep using marijuana even in situations where it is dangerous to do so (such as while driving).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They keep using marijuana even when they know they have a physical or mental problem that was probably caused or made worse by their marijuana use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They need to smoke more and more to get the same effects they used to get with less. Or they get less effect from using the amount that used to get them high. This is called &quot;tolerance.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have &quot;withdrawal symptoms&quot; if they stop using marijuana after using it for a long time. Withdrawal symptoms can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Irritability, anger, or aggression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nervousness or anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trouble sleeping (sometimes because of weird dreams)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased appetite or weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Restlessness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sadness or depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At least one of the following physical symptoms: stomach pain, shaking, sweating, fever, chills, headache</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2319472\"><span class=\"h1\">How is marijuana addiction treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, treatment involves addiction counseling and taking part in a support group.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Addiction counseling &ndash; People with addiction work with a counselor to better understand their addiction. They learn new ways to lead their life that do not involve drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Support groups &ndash; In support groups, people with addiction share their experiences with each other. The most common of these groups is Marijuana Anonymous (<a href=\"http://www.marijuana-anonymous.org/&amp;token=jFSEf/MMkMBvUbfTzXx0L8EpPr5AfFoo27cQCNCMU7O9oMDSZqbhV3FB/4A62FYX&amp;TOPIC_ID=16444\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.marijuana-anonymous.org</a>), but some people dislike that it involves God or a &quot;higher power.&quot; There are other groups that do not have that as a focus.</p><p/><p>Some people cannot stop using marijuana even with counseling and support groups. They might benefit from a more structured treatment program that includes specific types of therapy, behavioral exercises, and routine drug testing.</p><p>There are also a couple of medicines that might help some people who cannot stop using marijuana with the usual treatments. One medicine is called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetylcysteine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetylcysteine</a> (brand name: Acetadote). In the US it is sold over-the-counter as a nutritional supplement, but it can also be prescribed by a doctor. The other medicine is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">gabapentin</a> (sample brand names: Neurontin, Gralise). Gabapentin is sold only with a prescription. It is normally used to treat seizures or pain. There is not a lot of proof that these medicines work, but some experts think it is worth trying one of them.</p><p>For specific situations, there are other treatments. An example is family therapy, which can be especially helpful for children or teens with addiction who have families willing to participate in treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5393553\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alcohol use &mdash; when is drinking a problem?
