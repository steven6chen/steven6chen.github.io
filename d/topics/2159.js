Because of easy accessibility, aspiration, biopsy, and culture of the bone marrow may also play a role in the assessment of patients with fever of undetermined origin as well as in the diagnosis of various storage and infiltrative disorders.</p><p>The indications, contraindications, technique, and complications of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be reviewed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Evaluation of bone marrow aspirates and biopsies is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-bone-marrow-aspirate-smears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of bone marrow aspirate smears&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bone marrow is one of the most widely distributed organs in the human body. It is the principal site of blood formation beginning at the time of birth, at which time all bone cavities are filled with hematopoietic tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;, section on 'Bone marrow anatomy and microenvironment'</a>.)</p><p>By adolescence, active marrow is usually only found in the cavities of axial bones (sternum, ribs, vertebrae, clavicles, scapulae, skull, pelvis, and the proximal ends of the femurs and humeri) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74577\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74577 \">image 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Overall bone marrow cellularity approximates 100 percent at birth and declines with time, paralleling an age-associated reduction in hematopoietic activity. Accordingly, bone marrow cellularity in the adult is approximately 50 percent, with the remainder of the marrow being composed of adipose tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68384\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68384 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-bone-marrow-aspirate-smears#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of bone marrow aspirate smears&quot;, section on 'Estimation of cellularity and myeloid to erythroid ratio'</a>.)</p><p>Under physiologic conditions, all sites of hematopoiesis tend to exhibit uniform cellularity and cell lineage proportions. Thus, generalizations can be made regarding overall hematopoiesis from the evaluation of bone marrow at a single site. In most hematologic disorders, study of bone marrow at multiple sites has not been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Exceptions include malignancies that may have patchy marrow involvement (eg, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, metastatic disease), requiring either larger specimens or specimens from multiple sites (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Adequacy of the biopsy specimen'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to perform a bone marrow evaluation must be made after the critical assessment of pertinent information available from the history, physical, and laboratory studies, including a review of the complete blood count (CBC) and examination of the peripheral blood smear. As noted above, bone marrow examination is a useful tool in the diagnosis and staging of various hematologic diseases and in the assessment of bone marrow cellularity, cellular morphology, and maturation. Highly specialized testing, such as cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and molecular analyses, can be performed on these specimens, and have become critically important in establishing certain diagnoses, especially the leukemias and lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Studies on excised tissue'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to accommodating blood cell formation, the bone marrow also houses a complex stromal complex, along with elements of the monocyte-macrophage system. These supporting cellular systems may also become involved in a number of systemic diseases. Accordingly, aspiration, biopsy, and culture of the bone marrow may have value in the assessment of patients with fever of undetermined origin and in the diagnosis of various storage and infiltrative diseases, in which the number <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> activity of these stromal cells may be deranged.</p><p>Most clinical scenarios require both bone marrow aspiration and biopsy for a complete hematologic evaluation. This is especially true when assessing overall bone marrow cellularity, determining patterns of marrow involvement, and searching for evidence of infiltration associated with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, solid malignancies, or storage diseases. Accordingly, bone marrow aspiration is most often accompanied by biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p>Exceptions to this rule are circumstances in which a very specific clinical question can be answered via aspiration alone. An example might be in the diagnosis and follow-up of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), as the diagnosis relies heavily on cytogenetic and molecular findings, as well as morphology, all of which can be obtained by aspiration or by sampling peripheral blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, even this is controversial, as some cases of CML may be accompanied by fibrosis, which is best assessed on the biopsy specimen. Aspiration alone may be adequate for the initial diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as routine surveillance bone marrow examinations on these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Thrombocytopenia, regardless of severity, is not a contraindication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. However, depending on the circumstances, platelet transfusion to insure a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;20,000/microL</span> may be warranted prior to the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

As an example, an email survey of members of the Australasian Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis and the Hematology Society of Australia and New Zealand asked hematologists about their current approaches to performing bone marrow biopsy among thrombocytopenic or anticoagulated patients. Results of this informal survey included the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In thrombocytopenic patients, 48 percent did not transfuse platelets, 49 percent transfused platelets only in selected patients, and 3 percent transfused platelets routinely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In anticoagulated patients, 13 percent performed the biopsy irrespective of the INR, 51 percent performed the biopsy if the INR was not above the therapeutic range, 18 percent performed the biopsy if the INR was &lt;2.0, and 18 percent stopped <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or reversed anticoagulation before performing the biopsy.</p><p/><p>There is little or no information concerning the risk of bleeding following bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/biopsy</span> in patients who are taking one or more antiplatelet agents. It is the general consensus that bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/biopsy</span> is a low-risk procedure and that the risk of thrombosis from stopping these agents prior to the biopsy is greater than the risk of bleeding if these agents are not stopped. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;, section on 'Estimating thromboembolic risk'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;, section on 'Medications affecting hemostasis'</a>.)</p><p>Post-procedural bleeding, if any, is almost always controlled by manual application of pressure to the site. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with suspected multiple myeloma or other disorders associated with bone resorption should not undergo sternal bone marrow aspiration due to an increased risk of sternal perforation. Bone marrow biopsy of the sternum should <strong>never</strong> be attempted in any patient, due to the fragility of the bone at this site as well as its proximity to the heart and great vessels.</p><p>Precautions may need to be taken if there is skin infection or osteomyelitis in the area of proposed aspiration or biopsy, or if the patient is unable to remain still for the procedure. Several complications may accompany bone marrow aspiration or biopsy despite adherence to these precautions (see <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANCE PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of important issues need to be resolved before the procedure is undertaken, including choice of the biopsy site, use of premedications and the need for an assistant, as well as determining the need and preparation necessary for specialized tests to be performed on the marrow specimens. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1277106\"><span class=\"h2\">Deciding which tests are needed</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tests that are obtained depend on the clinical scenario and the diagnoses that are being considered. </p><p>Before starting the procedure, decisions should be made about whether both an aspirate and biopsy are required, and if special samples are needed for additional tests (eg, cytogenetics, flow cytometry, special stains) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82481 \">table 2</a>). A discussion with the hematopathology laboratory should occur before the procedure is undertaken to make sure that the appropriate samples, sample collection vials, and tests have been agreed upon. As examples, cytogenetic testing requires live cells, ideally in culture medium (not formalin-fixed cells), and special stains may require more slides than are routinely prepared. </p><p>Signed informed consent must be obtained in advance from the patient, parent, or health care proxy, as appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1948646\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of the procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obtaining the sample when laboratory personnel are available for discussion and optimal specimen handling is generally preferable. However, in certain cases it may be necessary to obtain the sample in off-hours. Examples may include obtaining a sample before glucocorticoids are administered to a patient with possible lymphoid malignancy. Importantly, however, treatment of the patient should <strong>not</strong> be delayed solely to obtain a better sample.</p><p>It is also preferable to have a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and blood smear that was obtained on the same day as the bone marrow sample, to allow identification of specific cells and to correlate the bone marrow cellularity with cytopenias in the peripheral blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of aspiration or biopsy site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The iliac crest is the only site at which both aspiration and biopsy may be safely performed in the adult.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The posterior superior iliac crest and spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78950 \">figure 1</a>) is the favored site of examination in the adult, as well as in the child and in most infants. This site also provides the least discomfort to the patient compared with other sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anterior iliac crest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51068 \">figure 2</a>) may be used for bone marrow aspiration and biopsy in adults when access to the posterior iliac crest is limited (eg, the patient is unable to be moved for proper access to the chosen aspiration site, morbid obesity, skin diseases, or previous radiation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. An initial attempt to sample the posterior iliac bone may be worthwhile, even in neonates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In selected cases, bone marrow may be obtained from the greater trochanter of the femur, individual vertebral bodies, or ribs. Such procedures, including open bone biopsies, are best obtained through surgical consultation, and may require CT guidance (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Surgical biopsy'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtaining bone marrow from a site which has been previously irradiated is likely to yield suboptimal results, especially in terms of overall cellularity. Another site should be chosen if at all possible.</p><p/><p>Bone marrow may be aspirated from the sternum in patients over 12 years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53887\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53887 \">figure 3</a>), although <strong>biopsy at this site is contraindicated </strong>because of its minimal thickness. Special care needs to be taken if this site is chosen for marrow aspiration, since penetration of the inner table of the sternum or penetration through a rib interspace may lead to fatal hemorrhage (see <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below). </p><p>In premature infants and some full-term infants, the iliac bone has not completely ossified, and an alternative bone (eg, the anterior portion of the tibia) should be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. If the anterior tibia must be entered, it should only be used for aspiration and limited to infants younger than 18 months of age.</p><p>On occasion, it may not be possible to identify an <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/biopsy</span> site because of the presence of excessive adipose tissue; surface landmarks may be difficult to identify <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the available needle may not reach the bone surface (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Needle selection'</a> below). If these maneuvers have failed, one solution is to perform the procedure using computed tomography (CT) guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In cases in which the landmarks can be identified but the needle is too short, a trephine biopsy needle may be used for both the aspiration and biopsy.

It cannot be overstated that the quality of the specimen obtained may be vastly superior in a cooperative and comfortable patient.</p><p>In children with procedure phobias, the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> under carefully controlled conditions can be very beneficial, producing both relaxation and antegrade amnesia; lorazepam or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a> may have a similar effect in adults with anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. This can be particularly helpful if the child or anxious adult is likely to require multiple bone marrow evaluations over a period of time, as in the treatment of acute leukemia. A safe conscious sedation policy should be in place prior to using drugs such as benzodiazepines or opioids in patients of any age.</p><p>The use of inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> and oxygen, an established combination used for pain management and sedation in certain gynecologic procedures and in sigmoidoscopy, is both well-tolerated and effective for use during bone marrow aspiration and biopsy; use of this agent may diminish the risk of prolonged sedation associated with benzodiazepine or opioid dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].

A needle with a stylet that can be fixed in place initially and removed later is preferred. It is important to use a sharp needle, as well as one long enough to penetrate through the subcutaneous tissues and into the marrow cavity. A needle chosen for sternal aspiration should be shorter than one used for aspiration at the iliac crest, and should be equipped with a guard to insure controlled entrance into (and not beyond) the sternal marrow cavity (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Sternal aspiration'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jamshidi biopsy needle with stylet and a device (obturator) for removing the biopsy core from the needle without damage to the specimen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Posterior iliac crest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper bone marrow aspiration and biopsy requires strict attention to detail.

In heavier patients, a lateral decubitus position with the knees pulled closer to the chest, or a prone position accompanied by pressure over the bone, may help to identify the landmarks by reducing the depth of the fat pad overlying the iliac crest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examine the potential site for evidence of infection; palpate the posterior iliac crest and posterior superior iliac spine and locate these landmarks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78950 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The anterior superior iliac spine should also be palpated and located, as the needle will be pointed in this direction once the bone has been entered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51068 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain a steady dialogue with the patient, explaining each step, alerting the patient to potential discomfort, with reassurance as needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of local skin problems (eg, infection, induration, ulceration), the usual site for aspiration and biopsy is approximately three finger-widths from the midline and two finger-widths inferior to the iliac crest. Mark the chosen area by making an indentation in the skin with a coin, fingernail, or the end of a ballpoint pen with the writing tip retracted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using sterile technique, protective clothing and gloves (and eye wear if necessary), the bone marrow tray should be first opened and organized for easy access to needed items. Needles, stylets, and plastic (not glass) syringes should be checked to ensure that they are intact and function properly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleanse the chosen area with povidone-iodine solution and drape a sterile field. Prepare the instruments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthetize the skin and subcutaneous tissues with a 1 to 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> solution using a 23-gauge needle; then anesthetize the periosteum by repeatedly injecting small amounts of lidocaine solution at different points on the surface of the bone with a 21-gauge needle. It is useful to anesthetize a dime-sized area of the periosteum surrounding the targeted location, as the aspiration and biopsy should be taken from slightly different adjacent sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While waiting for the anesthetic to produce its effect, extra syringes for special studies (eg, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular studies) can be appropriately anticoagulated. Specimens for molecular studies should not contain heparin. The help of an assistant is invaluable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once local anesthesia has been achieved, make a small (3 mm) skin incision with a scalpel blade at the site of insertion of the aspiration needle, in order to facilitate its entry and promote organized healing of the wound.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the bone marrow needle (with stylet in place) perpendicular to the skin at the previously marked point, and gently advance it to the periosteum. In order to be sure that the needle is entering correctly, the second and third fingers on the hand not being used to insert the needle should be placed on the iliac crest or spine and the needle inserted between them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. When the needle has been advanced to the periosteum, it should be pointed laterally in the direction of the anterior superior iliac spine on the same side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51068 \">figure 2</a>), rather than continuing in a perpendicular direction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Do not twist more than 180 degrees to penetrate the periosteum and the cortical bone; a &quot;give&quot; is felt when the needle enters the marrow cavity. At the point of entry, the patient may express complaints of a deep-seated pain. It is important to alert the patient to this possibility ahead of time. Continue to advance the needle slightly to ensure that it is anchored into the bone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the stylet, attach a 2 mL syringe to the aspiration needle, and again advise the patient that the aspiration may cause a brief period of pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspirate 0.2 to 0.5 mL of marrow contents and remove the syringe. It may be necessary to attach additional syringes if many studies have been ordered. In general it is prudent to avoid aspirating more than 0.5 mL per syringe, as greater amounts may be prone to dilution of the bone marrow sample with peripheral blood or to clotting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The non-anticoagulated specimen should be handed to the assistant, who will assess the quality of the sample (ie, determine the presence or absence of grossly visible bone spicules) and prepare the various smears. If an assistant is not available, the sample should be used immediately to make a bone marrow aspirate smear <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> placed in an appropriate tube for later smear preparation. Anticoagulated specimens should be sent to the laboratory for further preparation and other tests (eg, cytogenetics, molecular studies, cultures, flow cytometry). The patient should be made aware of the need for multiple specimens at the outset, since each separate aspiration may be painful, despite fully adequate local anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Preparation of samples'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If aspiration attempts are not successful, reinsert the stylet (the needle may be rotated) and advance the needle a short distance; repeat attempts at aspiration with the syringe and suction. If multiple aspiration attempts are unsuccessful, an alternate site (eg, the other posterior iliac crest) may be approached with the same sterile strategy after the bone marrow biopsy has been obtained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once it has been determined that the aspirate is satisfactory, reinsert the stylet, and remove the needle (with stylet in place) by using a similar twisting motion, and apply pressure to the site with a small gauze square until the bleeding stops.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a biopsy is necessary, prepare the Jamshidi needle and advance it into the cortical bone, using the same incision but a slightly different site, with a steady twisting movement until it is firmly lodged. This may require a greater amount of pressure than was used for the aspiration. Remove the stylet and with a rotating motion advance the needle another 15 to 20 mm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redirect the needle tip and rotate it 360 degrees in both directions to separate the biopsy specimen from the surrounding marrow tissue. Following this step, the needle should be advanced a very short distance prior to removal. This step may prevent the specimen from being pulled out of the needle at the biopsy site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the needle with a slight twisting motion, place a sterile dressing over the site, and apply pressure for several minutes until the bleeding stops. Once hemostasis is achieved, a bandage should be applied, and the patient should be instructed to lie supine for 10 or more minutes. Pressure dressings may be required in thrombocytopenic patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the biopsy needle has been removed, the specimen may be extracted from the needle by inserting the obturator (or stylet) through the distal (cutting) end of the needle. The bone marrow biopsy can then be placed on a slide, where imprints (&quot;touch prints&quot;) are made before the core specimen is further processed for cytologic investigations. This step is especially useful in situations where a bone marrow aspirate could not be obtained (see <a href=\"#H1277224\" class=\"local\">'The dry tap'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examine the biopsy specimen. If the specimen consists mostly of homogeneous, white material (cortical bone) or glistening tissue (cartilage), it may be necessary to attempt a second biopsy for a more satisfactory specimen.

The filtered blood is concentrated into four layers by centrifugation; each layer may then be prepared into individual smears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/3,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1277224\"><span class=\"h2\">The dry tap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A &quot;dry tap&quot; is defined by a situation in which no bone marrow sample is obtainable by aspiration (ie, there are no identifiable bone spicules in the specimen) despite easily obtained marrow blood. Faulty technique may be the cause, in that the tip of the aspirating needle may not have penetrated into the marrow cavity.</p><p>More often, a dry tap is due to alterations within the marrow associated with myeloproliferative or leukemic disorders. Such marrow changes usually involve an element of fibrosis, metastatic tumor infiltration, or granuloma formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In such cases, bone marrow biopsy should always be performed. Touch preparations of the biopsy can be made which will often provide sufficient cellular material for diagnostic evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-bone-marrow-aspirate-smears#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of bone marrow aspirate smears&quot;, section on 'The dry tap'</a>.)</p><p>There have been rare reports of unexplained iliac crest bone marrow hypoplasia, not explained by sampling issues or by previous trauma or radiation to the site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy imprint (&quot;touch&quot;) preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the aspirated specimen is inadequate (devoid of particles) or unobtainable (dry tap), a touch preparation may be prepared from the biopsy core. Cells on the surface of the biopsy core stick to slides and are stained for morphologic, cytochemical, or immunoperoxidase evaluation.</p><p>This technique requires placing a fresh core biopsy specimen onto a clean microscope slide. A second slide is then pressed against the core specimen and rolled slightly from side to side. Two or three slides with several imprints on each slide should be prepared in this manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/3,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,43</a>]. The remaining biopsy specimen can be processed normally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1948632\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy specimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biopsy specimen is placed in fixative (commonly B5-mercuric chloride, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium acetate</a>, and formalin) for decalcification and tissue section preparation. If specialized testing such as immunohistochemistry or molecular studies may be required, it is useful to discuss this in advance with the pathologist in case it affects the choice of fixative. As an example, B5-based fixatives cannot be used for DNA testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-PROCEDURE INSTRUCTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the procedure, the patient should lie in a supine position, so as to apply body weight to the biopsy site, for at least 10 to 15 minutes. The site should then be inspected to ensure that there is no further bleeding. The patient should be advised that the procedure site may be slightly tender for several days. The following additional routine instructions should be given:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pain control, a dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> 650 mg orally is usually adequate. If necessary, the patient may be instructed to continue acetaminophen 650 mg every four to six hours as necessary for the subsequent 24- to 48-hour period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be directed to contact the physician or clinic if swelling, marked tenderness, increased pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> further bleeding is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should avoid overexertion (eg, heavy activity or exercise) for at least 24 hours, to avoid potential pain or bleeding at the site of the procedure. The area of the <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/biopsy</span> should be kept dry, using a small dressing or bandage, during this time to minimize the chance of infection or bleeding.</p><p/><p>If the patient continues to bleed from the <span class=\"nowrap\">aspirate/biopsy</span> site after an initial observation period of 10 to 15 minutes, it may be prudent to reapply pressure to the site and have the patient lie supine for at least one hour. If bleeding continues after this additional time of observation, it may be necessary to transfuse platelets if the patient is severely thrombocytopenic or if platelet function is suspected to be compromised.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications following bone marrow biopsy are rare. In a survey of members of the British Society of Haematology reported in 2003, there were 26 adverse events, including one fatality, out of an estimated total of 55,000 biopsy procedures (0.05 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A follow-up survey of this group, reported in 2006 involving 20,323 procedures, resulted in the reporting of 15 adverse events (0.07 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for an adverse event included diagnosis of a myeloproliferative disorder, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, obesity, or disseminated intravascular coagulation. In general, however, when complications do occur, they tend to be minor, mainly consisting of bleeding at the <span class=\"nowrap\">biopsy/aspiration</span> site or infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58801\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58801 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemorrhage from bone marrow aspiration can occur at any site, is more likely in the individual with thrombocytopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormal platelet function, and is associated most commonly with the myeloproliferative disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50</a>]. Of interest, the risk of hemorrhage has not been found to be associated with operator experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>In most cases, bleeding is controlled by manual application of pressure to the site. Pressure dressings should be applied to the site following the procedure in patients with thrombocytopenia. If bleeding continues, platelet transfusions may have to be given if the patient is severely thrombocytopenic, or if platelet function is compromised.</p><p>There have been rare reports of retroperitoneal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/14,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,51,52</a>], gluteal artery laceration or pseudoaneurysm with gluteal compartment syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/48,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,53</a>], and internal iliac artery pseudoaneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. These are presumed due to penetration of the needle through the inner cortex of the iliac bone. In a CT-based cadaver study, these complications, as well as penetration of the sacroiliac joint, appeared less likely to occur when the needle inserted into the posterior superior iliac spine was pointed in the direction of the ipsilateral anterior superior iliac spine, rather than when it was pointed in a perpendicular direction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Posterior iliac crest'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections are usually minor, requiring only topical medications. More serious infections may occur in immunocompromised patients. There is a potential risk of contracting infections from a patient, and some recommend double-gloving. However, universal precautions should be applied in all cases, and the operator should always take care to avoid needle penetration of the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor seeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been rare case reports of tumor seeding from the bone marrow into the needle track (eg, into muscle, subcutaneous tissue, skin) following bone marrow biopsy, in patients with small cell lung carcinoma, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle breakage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, a bone marrow needle may break.

The sternum is only one centimeter thick in the adult, which may predispose to through-and-through penetration of the sternum with potentially fatal cardiovascular complications, pericardial tamponade, pneumothorax, pulmonary emboli, infection, and bone erosion, thinning, or sternal fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Sternal aspiration should not be undertaken in young children due to the risk of perforating the sternal plate.
