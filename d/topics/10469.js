Because of their rapid growth, all neonates when compared with older individuals have higher relative requirements of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P), which are critical components for bone structural integrity and growth. Preterm infants have even greater dietary requirements, as they need to compensate for the loss of accretion of these nutrients during the third trimester of pregnancy.</p><p>The management of bone health in neonates, including preterm infants, will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89952645\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal bone health is critical during this active period of growth. As a result, it is imperative that infants receive the necessary intake of the key nutrients calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) to ensure adequate mineralization for bone structural integrity and growth. The daily requirement of these nutrients is affected by the gestational age of the infant, and factors that affect intestinal absorption and urinary excretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89952654\"><span class=\"h2\">Gestational age and placental transfer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During pregnancy, calcium and phosphorus are actively transferred from the mother to the fetus, reaching a peak accretion rate at 32 to 36 weeks gestation for calcium of 100 to 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of fetal weight per day, and for phosphorus, 60 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of fetal weight per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The third trimester is the period of most active growth and the increased accretion rate is in response to the higher fetal needs for the developing skeleton. As a result, requirements of Ca and P increase with decreasing gestational age to compensate for the loss of accretion of these minerals.</p><p>In particular, extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (birth weights below 1000 g) or those born before 27 weeks gestation are at high risk for rickets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. Unfortified human milk, parenteral nutrition, and formulas designed for term infants do not contain enough Ca and P to fully meet the needs for bone mineralization in preterm infants. As a result, the use of these diets without further supplementation would limit bone growth, resulting in rickets, and potentially increase the risk of bone fractures. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Rickets in premature infants'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5089958\"><span class=\"h2\">Intestinal absorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ca and P absorption occur in the small intestine by both active transport and passive diffusion. Vitamin D is usually essential for the active absorption of calcium; however, it may contribute little to Ca absorption in premature infants in the first weeks of life, as most of the absorption appears to be passive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In neonates, including healthy preterm infants, the absorption of Ca from human milk or commercial formula is approximately 60 percent of intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/3,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8-10</a>], whereas the absorption of P is greater in human milk than in commercial formula (90 versus 80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. P retention is improved when the ratio of Ca to P intake is 1.6:1 to 1.8:1 compared with 2:1 on a mg to mg basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Of note, a ratio of Ca to P of 1.6:1 on a mg to mg basis is equivalent to a ratio of 1.2:1 on a mmol to mmol basis. Absorption of both minerals is affected positively by postnatal age, the intake of Ca, P, lactose, and fat, and vitamin D level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Medications used in neonates that may directly interfere with Ca absorption include glucocorticoids (inhibit intestinal transfer) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a>. Phenytoin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a> may indirectly inhibit Ca absorption by interfering with vitamin D metabolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1149404\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal excretion and absorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regulation of renal absorption and excretion is another important mechanism for Ca and P homeostasis. Parathyroid hormone reduces urinary Ca excretion, an appropriate response if hypocalcemia has stimulated parathyroid hormone secretion. Under normal circumstances, nearly all filtered calcium is reabsorbed in the renal tubule.</p><p>In the neonate, the two main clinical exceptions for hypercalciuria, which may lead to calcium depletion, are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loop diuretics enhance calcium excretion, which may result in nephrocalcinosis. In contrast, thiazide diuretics stimulate Ca absorption and reduce urinary calcium excretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrocalcinosis-in-neonates#H451774016\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrocalcinosis in neonates&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>P deficiency enhances calcium renal excretion leading to hypercalciuria, ongoing calcium loss, and potential calcium depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Treatment with P will correct the P deficiency and hypercalciuria, but Ca should also be given, as infants are depleted of both calcium and phosphorus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89952855\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF BONE HEALTH IN PRETERM INFANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The routine management of bone health in preterm infants is focused on preventing rickets by providing adequate calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) intake to promote normal bone growth. The requirements for Ca and P intake in this group of patients need to account for the loss of intrauterine accretion, bioavailability of nutrients in enterally fed infants, and ongoing nutrient losses. Preterm infants who have inadequate mineral intake are at high risk for developing rickets. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Rickets in premature infants'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89953225\"><span class=\"h2\">In-hospital management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89954021\"><span class=\"h3\">Enteral nutrition</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89953283\"><span class=\"h4\">Calcium and phosphorus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appropriate intake for a particular nutrient, such as calcium, is based on the estimate of nutrient losses, the bioavailability of the particular nutrient for those infants who are enterally fed, which may be affected by incomplete absorption, and in the case of Ca and P, the net daily bone deposition needed for adequate growth and structural integrity. However, data are limited in determining the precise amount of dietary Ca and P intake needed to achieve intrauterine accretion of these nutrients while accounting for their bioavailability, which for Ca is usually about 60 percent absorption. As a result, guidelines vary regarding the recommended intakes for enterally fed preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, the recommended intake for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight below 1500 g) is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ca: 150 to 220 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>P: 75 to 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The European guidelines recommend the following intake for VLBW infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ca: 120 to 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>P: 65 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guidelines for VLBW infants provided by an international consensus development group are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ca: 120 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>P: 60 to 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal Ca:P ratio in enteral feeds for preterm infants is probably about 1.5 to 1.7 on a mg to mg basis, although the ideal range has not been clearly established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>].</p><p/><p>These variations in recommendations are largely based on different reviews of the data related to providing safe intake while ensuring adequate bone mineralization. However, as evidenced by the ranges provided by these recommendations, no single value for calcium intake can be considered as correct. In the United States, higher levels of calcium and phosphorus are generally provided than in Europe, with no convincing evidence of either risk or benefit relative to European intakes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89953395\"><span class=\"h4\">Vitamin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In term infants, daily vitamin D supplementation of 400 international units (10 micrograms) consistently maintains 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at target levels &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> which is the accepted standard defining vitamin D sufficiency (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents#H723639\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Vitamin D supplementation for infants'</a>). </p><p>However, the role of vitamin D for intestinal absorption of calcium in preterm infants is uncertain, as limited data suggest that Ca absorption in preterm infants is primarily a passive process via a paracellular route and is <strong>not </strong>vitamin D dependent during the first month of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, data are limited on the relationship between vitamin D intake and serum 25-OH vitamin D in preterm infants.</p><p>Despite this paucity of evidence, guidelines recommend vitamin D supplementation, as levels of this hormone are low in preterm infants who had less time to accumulate vitamin D through transplacental transfer. Guidelines vary on the amount of vitamin D intake as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, a recommended vitamin D intake for VLBW infants is between 200 to 400 international units, and is increased to 400 international units when the infant reaches 1500 g of body weight and is tolerating full enteral nutrition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Europe, guidelines suggest a higher vitamin D intake of 800 to 1000 international units during hospitalization or the first months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A consensus group recommends intake of vitamin D between 400 and 1000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> for preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], suggesting that a broad range of intakes is likely safe and beneficial. As an example, one study found that total intakes of 400 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> met the needs of nearly all infants, and 1000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> kept all infants from having low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, among infants with the higher vitamin D intake, some had high serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D that might be of risk, and no biological outcomes suggested any benefit to intakes &gt;400 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span>.</p><p/><p>One small trial from India reported that infants assigned vitamin D supplementation of 400 international units were at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D level &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> at 40 weeks post menstrual age (PMA) than those assigned 800 international units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, mean total body bone mineral content and density, and serum alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) were similar in the two groups at three months corrected age. These findings suggest that a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level may not be a marker of clinical outcomes in this population and should therefore be interpreted with some caution pending further investigations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89953536\"><span class=\"h4\">Choice of dietary source: fortified human milk and preterm formula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The content of Ca and P in human milk and formula designed for term infants is insufficient to achieve intrauterine accretion rates and normal bone mineralization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. In one study of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (birth weight below 1000 g) fed unfortified human milk, bone mineralization measured by photon absorptiometry was reduced, and one-third of the infants had rickets or fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In contrast, several studies have shown that human milk supplemented with Ca and P improves linear growth, and increases bone mineralization during hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Net mineral retention and bone mineral content are improved with increased intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90620\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90620 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>As a result, enteral nutrition for all infants with birth weights below 1800 to 2000 g should be provided by either fortified human milk or formulas designed for preterm infants, which have high mineral content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>]. Because bone mineralization content is also low for small for gestational age infants, the recommendations for these products are based on weight as opposed to gestational age. In VLBW infants, full enteral feedings of 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day of fortified human milk or preterm formula provide estimated intakes of Ca of 180 to 220 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, P of 100 to 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, and vitamin D of 300 to 400 international units per day, which adequately meets the needs of these neonates and reduces their risk of rickets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90621 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In contrast, unfortified human milk given at the same volume of enteral feeds only provides intakes of Ca around 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, P of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, and vitamin D of 2.4 international units per day.

However, switching from high mineral content sources should be delayed in infants who have additional risk factors for rickets (eg, prolonged parenteral nutrition or fluid restriction of &lt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day) or who have a persistently elevated serum APA of greater than 800 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span>.

This is related in part to the need to limit mineral concentrations because of their solubility in parenteral nutrition solutions. However, Ca and P concentrations should be maximized to improve mineral retention. As an example, in a study of 24 VLBW infants receiving total parenteral nutrition, administration of 17 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (680 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> Ca and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (660 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> P resulted in net retention of 70 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day Ca and P [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-neonatal-bone-health/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>For infants who receive parenteral nutrition for more than four weeks, subsequent oral supplementation is generally needed once enteral feeds are established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28254018\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been proposed that lack of physical activity contributes to poor bone health in preterm infants.

Because abnormal values are uncommon in the first four weeks of life in VLBW infants, initial testing is started at four weeks after birth with subsequent biweekly testing. Infants with additional risk factors for rickets, such as prolonged parenteral nutrition or inadequate enteral intake of Ca and P, are tested weekly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90619\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90619 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>In general, APA values will peak at 400 to 800 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> and then decrease in infants without rickets.

The amounts of Ca and P retained by the term infant who is exclusively breastfed during the first six months and is supplemented with solid foods during the second six months provide adequate nutrients for appropriate bone mineralization and growth. </p><p>When mother's own milk is unavailable despite adequate lactation support, pasteurized donor human milk from a reliable human milk bank is the preferred alternative. This strategy is typically used for very low birth weight infants (VLBW; &lt;1500 grams birth weight), and sometimes for larger infants who require tube feedings. Whether maternal or donor, human milk given to VLBW infants is fortified to provide nutrients including bone minerals to meet the needs of this population. Because safe donor milk can be costly and supplies are limited, it is reasonable to use premature formula rather than donor milk for infants &gt;1500 grams who are fed orally, if mother's own milk is not available.

Rather, sunlight exposure is needed to provide for the cutaneous formation of vitamin D. As a result, rickets can occur in breastfed infants who have inadequate exposure to sunlight or are deeply pigmented.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfed infants receive vitamin D supplementation in a dose of 400 international units per day started within the first weeks of life. Some clinicians choose to start vitamin D during the initial birth hospitalization, whereas others prefer to wait a few days until breastfeeding is well established &#160; Vitamin D supplementation in infants is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

Calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) are critical components for bone structural integrity and growth.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All neonates compared with older individuals have higher relative requirements of Ca and P because of their rapid growth. The daily requirement of these nutrients is affected by the gestational age of the infant, and factors that affect intestinal absorption and urinary excretion. Requirements increase with decreasing gestational age to compensate for the loss of accretion with premature delivery. In particular, very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weights below 1500 g) are at risk for rickets, as they need to compensate for the loss of accretion of these nutrients during the third trimester of pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H89952645\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of bone health in preterm infants is focused on preventing rickets by providing adequate Ca and P intake to compensate for the loss of intrauterine accretion and to promote normal bone growth. Unfortified human milk, parenteral nutrition, and formulas designed for term infants do not contain enough Ca and P to fully meet the needs for normal bone mineralization in these infants. (See <a href=\"#H89952855\" class=\"local\">'Management of bone health in preterm infants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In preterm infants with birth weights below 2000 g who are receiving enteral feeds, we recommend that fortified human milk or formula designed for preterm infants be used as the dietary product (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In VLBW infants, full enteral feedings of 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day of fortified human milk or preterm formula provide estimated intakes of Ca of 180 to 220 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, P of 100 to 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, and vitamin D of 300 to 400 international units per day, which adequately meets the needs for VLBW infants and reduces the risk of rickets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90621 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H89953536\" class=\"local\">'Choice of dietary source: fortified human milk and preterm formula'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Data are limited on the need and level of vitamin D supplementation for preterm infants. However, we suggest that vitamin D supplementation be given to preterm infants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In our practice, we provide an intake of vitamin D for VLBW infants between 200 to 400 international units, which is increased to 400 international units when the infant reaches 1500 g of body weight and is tolerating full enteral nutrition. (See <a href=\"#H89953395\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin D'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In all VLBW infants, we suggest ongoing assessment of bone health using laboratory testing that measures serum P and alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) starting at four weeks of age, with subsequent biweekly testing (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This testing can be discontinued once the serum APA has peaked and is declining to less than about 500 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> and the infant is on appropriate enteral nutrition. (See <a href=\"#H89954002\" class=\"local\">'Assessment and management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After discharge, Ca and P supplementation may be required, and vitamin D supplementation of 400 international units should be continued. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Postdischarge management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VLBW infants are at risk for rickets because of inadequate Ca and P intake. Other risk factors include long-term parenteral nutrition, use of loop diuretics, and fluid restriction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90619\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90619 \">table 3</a>). The diagnosis of rickets is suggested by APA levels &gt;1000 international units and is confirmed by wrist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> knee radiographs. Patients with rickets are managed by providing adequate Ca and P intake through enteral feedings of fortified human milk or formula for premature infants. Supplemental elemental Ca and P may be provided for infants who do not tolerate sufficient volumes of these dietary products. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Rickets in premature infants'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In term infants, human milk and formula designed for term infants have adequate concentrations of Ca and P to meet the needs of term infants. In exclusively breastfed infants, we recommend vitamin D supplementation (dose of 400 international units per day), as human milk has inadequate vitamin content to maintain vitamin D sufficiency.
