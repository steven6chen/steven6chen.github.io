The disease is named for Moritz Kaposi, a Hungarian dermatologist on the faculty of the University of Vienna, who first described the entity in 1872 as &quot;idiopathic multiple pigmented sarcoma of the skin&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>KS is classified into four types based upon the clinical circumstances in which it develops: classic (the type originally described by Kaposi, which typically presents in middle or old age), endemic (several forms described in Sub-Saharan indigenous Africans prior to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] epidemic), iatrogenic (a type associated with immunosuppressive drug therapy, typically seen in renal allograft recipients), and AIDS-associated (epidemic KS). The different epidemiologic and clinical aspects of these four types are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76370 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic review will focus on the epidemiology, risk factors, pathology, and molecular pathogenesis of classic KS. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of classic KS is discussed elsewhere, as is AIDS-related KS and iatrogenic KS developing in the setting of immunosuppressive therapy.

Although cases have been described around the world, including in South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], the disease is most often diagnosed in individuals from the Mediterranean basin and Central and Eastern Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>], or their descendants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/5,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13-15</a>]. The highest incidence rates in Europe are in two Mediterranean Italian islands, Sardinia and Sicily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>An analysis of 2667 incident KS cases diagnosed between 1995 and 2002 and registered by 75 population-based European cancer registries that contributed to the RARECARE project (&quot;Surveillance of rare cancer in Europe&quot;) estimated that there were 1642 new cases per year in the 27 countries comprising the European Union at that time and approximately 10,500 persons alive in Europe with a past diagnosis of KS as of the beginning of 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The precise proportion of CKS was unknown; however, 852 diagnoses were made among individuals 65 years or older (most likely to represent CKS), 1147 among individuals less than 45 years of age (more likely to be human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-associated), and the remaining 572 among individuals 45 to 64 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>CKS, sometimes presenting with advanced cutaneous, lymphatic, and visceral disease, has also been described among Uyghurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], members of a <span class=\"nowrap\">Turkic/Eurasian</span> ethnic minority found primarily in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of Northwestern China.</p><p>The geographic distribution of CKS corresponds to regional differences in the prevalence of human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A discussion of potential routes of HHV-8 spread is beyond the scope of this review; however, an excellent summary is available that identifies salivary shedding together with unidentified sociocultural practices that promote saliva passage as the likely route of infection in children in endemic, high-prevalence areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The global, regional, and gender-specific seroprevalence of HHV-8 infection and aspects of viral transmission are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-epidemiology-and-transmission-of-human-herpesvirus-8-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology, epidemiology, and transmission of human herpesvirus 8 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CKS typically first presents in men (and women, although less often) in their 60s and 70s but has been described in patients in their teens and 20s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Only 4 to 8 percent of cases develop in individuals younger than age 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) infection is required for the development of classic Kaposi sarcoma (CKS), but not all infected persons develop the disease. In the Mediterranean area, for example, CKS develops annually in only 0.03 percent of HHV-8 infected men and only 0.01 to 0.02 percent of HHV-8 infected women over age 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This implies the existence of cofactors that influence the risk of CKS after infection with HHV-8.</p><p>Interpretation of most studies evaluating potential risk factors for CKS in persons infected with HHV-8 is limited because comparisons were made with control groups whose HHV-8 infection status was unknown. This limitation was overcome by a series of studies performed in Italy in which case patients with CKS were compared with HHV-8 infected persons (ie, those with antibodies to HHV-8) but without KS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-29</a>]. The following sections describe those factors that have been found to be associated with an elevated risk of CKS among infected persons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Anti-HHV-8 antibodies and viremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comparison of age- and sex-matched HHV-8 infected Italians with and without CKS showed that HHV-8 DNA detection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and high HHV-8 lytic and latent antibody titers were significantly associated with the development of CKS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>More recently, it has been suggested that a certain subtype of HHV-8, strain A, may be associated with higher blood viral loads and more aggressive disease behavior than strain C, which was associated with slowly progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Inherited variations in immunomodulating genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>KS lesions are characterized, in part, by the presence of proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors that are thought to regulate HHV-8 replication and possibly CKS pathogenesis. The influence of inherited variations in genes that modulate cytokine expression on the development of CKS was addressed in a study of 28 common genetic variants of 14 immunomodulatory genes using genomic DNA from HHV-8 infected Italians with and without CKS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The risk of CKS was associated with specific haplotypes of the interleukin 8 receptor-beta (<em>IL8RB</em>) and interleukin 13 (<em>IL13</em>) genes. Although it is not clear how these genes cooperate to promote CKS pathogenesis or whether either or both work directly or indirectly to promote CKS pathogenesis, the findings suggest that genetically determined differences in cytokine expression may influence CKS risk. In an analysis of a Finnish family in which five members in two generations developed CKS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], the gene coding for signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 4 (<em>STAT4</em>), which regulates interferon gamma responses, was identified as a potential CKS predisposition gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In addition to these observations, others have found that, among HHV-8 infected Italians without CKS, high HHV-8 lytic antibody titers, which may be a marker of lytic reactivation, were associated with a common promoter variant in <em>IL6</em> and a specific haplotype of <em>IL4</em>, and a high latent HHV-8 antibody titer was associated with a specific haplotype of the IL12 subunit A (<em>IL12A</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These findings suggest that host genetic factors may affect the risk of CKS at least in part by influencing the ability to develop antibodies to HHV-8 and, ultimately, control HHV-8 infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunosuppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunosuppression, either iatrogenic (ie, in allograft recipients) or acquired (ie, in the setting of human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection), is well described as a risk factor for KS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Development of malignancy following solid organ transplantation&quot;, section on 'Kaposi sarcoma'</a>.)</p><p>The role of immunosuppression in CKS is less well defined, and there is no evidence for overt immunosuppression in most cases. However, there is evidence that more subtle degrees of immune suppression may be present in people with CKS. The following represents the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a previously described Italian study, patients with CKS were found to have a significantly lower total lymphocyte count than HHV-8 seropositive individuals without KS, although the mean absolute values for both total lymphocytes and the CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocyte subsets were within the normal range in affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In particular, a lymphocyte count below the median among younger individuals (age &lt;70) was strongly associated with an increased risk of CKS (odds ratio [OR] 8.0).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significantly lower total lymphocyte counts and CD4+ T cells were observed in a group of 91 Greek patients with CKS compared with age- and sex-matched controls without CKS (although their HHV-8 infection status was not specified) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. As in the previously cited study, mean values for all lymphocyte parameters were within the normal range in patients with CKS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A gradual but significant decrease in the number of total and B-lymphocytes has been linked to progression of CKS from its early stages to more advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased risk of CKS has been reported among individuals with a history of topical corticosteroid use (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.35-5.51) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], suggesting that local perturbations in cutaneous immune function may be an important predisposing factor for CKS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are conflicting data as to the risk of CKS among patients taking oral corticosteroids, with some studies supporting an association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and others not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increased incidence of CKS with advancing age, despite likely infection with HHV-8 early in life, may be a result of age-related immunosenescence.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although immunosuppression has been most consistently associated with the development of CKS, evidence also supports a possible pathogenetic role for immune activation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study found increased levels of the immune activation markers, neopterin and beta-2 microglobulin, in the serum of patients with CKS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/9,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23</a>]. A link between immune system activation and CKS is also suggested by the association of CKS with a history of asthma and allergy (the latter in men but not in women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study that compared plasma from 15 CKS cases with plasma from 29 matched controls using a multiplex panel of 70 markers of immunity found a strong and significant association of CKS with elevated levels of four circulating immune mediators, CXCL10, sIL-1RII, sIL-2RA, and CCL3, consistent with a tumor-promoting role for these cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p/><p>These preliminary findings require confirmation in larger, well-designed studies to assess their etiologic importance in CKS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Gender</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basis for the higher incidence of CKS among men than women is not well understood, but it appears not to be a consequence of significantly higher HHV-8 seroprevalence among men. It has been hypothesized (but not proven) that CKS risk is related to differences in how men and women manage persistent virus over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This is perhaps a result of a differential action of sex steroids on the immune system to modify antigen presentation, lymphocyte activation, cytokine and immune cell regulation, and the expression of disease resistance genes, including Fc receptors and the immunoglobulin G (IgG) superfamily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with other malignancies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are conflicting data on associations with other malignancies, either before or following a diagnosis of CKS, as evidenced by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A strong association between CKS and lymphohematopoietic malignancies was initially suggested by a single-institution United States study that described nine cases (four non-Hodgkin lymphoma, three Hodgkin lymphoma, one multiple myeloma, and one leukemia) diagnosed before, concurrent with, or subsequent to CKS in 72 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This corresponded to a 20-fold increase over the number of expected cases in the control population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, a study of 68 patients from the United Kingdom also suggested an increased rate of non-Hodgkin lymphoma subsequent to a diagnosis of CKS, but this conclusion was based on only three lymphoma cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study reported 6 cancer cases, 5 of which involved the lymphohematopoietic system, among 66 CKS patients presenting to a hospital in Athens, Greece [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Three of the cancers were diagnosed concurrently with, one preceded, and two were diagnosed subsequent to the diagnosis of CKS; no attempt was made to correlate cancer incidence with that of a control population.</p><p/><p>Most of the subsequent, larger, population-based studies from the United States (492 patients), Italy (201 patients), and a Nordic cohort (741 patients) failed to document an excess risk of cancer overall or of lymphomas specifically following the diagnosis of CKS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. However, an Israeli population-based study that investigated CKS as a second primary malignancy did find an increased incidence following a prior diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 5.3), Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 7.5), leukemia (OR = 5.3), especially chronic leukemia (OR = 10), and breast cancer (OR = 2.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The risk was particularly high among immigrants to Israel from the former Soviet Union (OR = 9.4) and Poland (OR = 7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Most of the spindle cells within the KS lesions show latent infection with HHV-8, although a small proportion of cells express lytic cycle genes. The limited number of viral genes expressed during latency are those that permit the virus to replicate within the host cell as an episome while disrupting the function of tumor-suppressor genes and avoiding recognition by the host immune system. On the other hand, viral genes expressed during the lytic cycle may be particularly important in increased expression of growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), that stimulate angiogenesis and activate growth regulatory pathways, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, that lead to dysregulated cell growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>It is not known whether the presence of peripheral vascular disease (with resultant tissue hypoxia and local elaboration of angiogenic factors) accounts for the frequent development of KS lesions on the lower extremities of the older adult patients who are at greatest risk for classic KS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p>Several viral gene products of HHV-8 affect both cell cycle regulation and the control of apoptosis, and segments of the HHV-8 genome contain viral oncogenes that are important in the pathogenesis of tumor formation. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>KS is classified into four types based upon the clinical circumstances in which it develops: classic, endemic, iatrogenic, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated. The different epidemiologic and clinical aspects of these four types are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76370 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Classic KS is most often diagnosed in men from the Mediterranean basin and Central and Eastern Europe, or their descendants. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>HHV-8 infection is required for the development of classic KS, but not all infected persons develop the disease. Immunosuppression is a well-described risk factor for KS. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Three main pathologic stages have been described in the progression of the lesions of KS: the patch stage, plaque stage, and nodular stage.
