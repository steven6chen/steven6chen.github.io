This type of testing is known as component-resolved diagnosis (CRD). Increased sensitivity and specificity can be achieved by assessing IgE binding to separate proteins, either purified native or recombinant, thereby providing improved diagnostic accuracy for predicting clinical reactivity. CRD may also provide additional prognostic information regarding the severity or persistence of food allergies.</p><p>CRD testing for pollen-related, plant-derived food allergies is reviewed here. Component testing for animal-derived food allergies is discussed separately. An overview of testing for food allergies is also presented separately.

This type of allergy is associated with symptoms that are generally limited to the oropharyngeal area (oral allergy <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/pollen-food</span> allergy syndrome). In the absence of sensitization to pollens, allergies to plant-derived foods are the result of sensitization to more stable proteins, such as the seed storage or lipid transfer proteins (LTPs). In these cases, reactions are more often systemic, and there is a higher risk for anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Component-resolved diagnosis (CRD) entails measurement of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses to individual allergens as opposed to measuring IgE responses to allergen extracts that contain a mixture of proteins, including ones that may have greater or less clinical relevance. The pattern of specific IgE reactivity to defined allergens can help determine which patients are at higher risk for allergic reactions versus those who are sensitized but clinically tolerant. It may also help distinguish between those who are at risk for more severe reactions versus those who are likely to have milder symptoms.</p><p>The prime example of the utility of CRD in the management of food allergy is peanut allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Several studies have noted that having detectable levels of specific IgE to the seed storage proteins are associated with more severe, persistent peanut allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>], whereas exclusive sensitization to a Bet v 1 homologue is more often associated with a low risk of reactivity to peanut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

This is a semiquantitative assay and, as such, may be better suited as a screening tool rather than a test for diagnosis and management of allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Technical differences in fixing allergen to the assay platforms result in variability of specific IgE binding. Thus, IgE values obtained with ImmunoCAP are not equivalent to the corresponding values obtained with the ISAC microarray system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Different units of measurement are used in the two assays (kU<sub>A</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> for ImmunoCAP versus ISAC standardized units [ISU] for ISAC).</p><p>In the United States, several of the individual component tests are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), whereas others are not.

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels to components, similar to whole peanut IgE, provide a likelihood of clinical reactivity but, on their own, are not diagnostic of allergy or severity of reactions. Guidelines on when to use component testing for peanut allergy are available and are reviewed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F95963\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95963 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H95610046\" class=\"local\">'Peanut testing approach'</a> below.)</p><p>Ara h 1, 2, and 3 are seed storage proteins and are the major allergens for peanut. Ara h 6 is closely related to Ara h 2. Ara h 8 is a birch allergen (Bet v 1) homologue associated mainly with milder symptoms localized to the oropharyngeal area. Ara h 9 is a nonspecific lipid transfer protein (LTP). Sensitization to this peanut protein is predominantly seen in the Mediterranean area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Ara h 10 and 11 are oleosins, and small studies have shown that some peanut-allergic patients have detectable IgE directed towards these proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, their clinical relevance is unclear. Ara h 12 and 13 are defensins that have antifungal activity. In one small series, they were associated with severe anaphylactic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>IgE binding to Ara h 2 outperforms whole peanut extract and other components in predicting clinical allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>], although optimal cutoff values for Ara h 2 with high positive-predictive values have not yet been determined. A range of cutoffs with varying sensitivities and specificities have been reported in several studies, probably due at least in part to differing patient selection criteria and geographic locations, reflecting inherent differences in patient characteristics such as genetics, diet, and environmental exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/3-6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6,9</a>].</p><p>Component-resolved diagnosis (CRD) testing can facilitate patient selection of oral food challenges. A stepwise approach for peanut IgE and Ara h 2 component testing can significantly reduce the need for oral food challenges in patients who are highly likely to be allergic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Data also suggest the utility of measuring IgE levels to other peanut components. Isolated sensitization to Ara h 8, for example, is associated with a high likelihood of tolerance to peanut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Thus, testing for peanut components prior to a food challenge can be beneficial for risk stratification, enhancing the ability to select patients who are likely to pass a diagnostic food challenge.</p><p>The following studies are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2010 study using a population-based birth cohort of 933 children in the United Kingdom demonstrated a high rate of false-positive test results when using skin prick tests (SPTs) and specific IgE testing to whole peanut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This study concluded that assessing IgE binding to Ara h 2 had higher accuracy than whole peanut extract and other components in predicting clinical reactivity to peanut.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One hundred ten (110) children (11.8 percent) had positive testing to peanut at eight years of age. Approximately two-thirds of these children (n = 66) had no reaction at oral food challenge to peanut, approximately one-fifth were allergic (12 by convincing history without challenge, 7 by challenge), and the remainder (n = 6) were deemed inconclusive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Approximately 15 percent were misclassified when a peanut-specific IgE level of &ge;15 kU<sub>A</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> or a SPT wheal size of &ge;8 mm was used for a cutoff, whereas the misclassification rate was reduced to approximately 7 percent when results from a microarray that included multiple recombinant allergens from peanut, tree pollens, grass pollens, and cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs) were used. Subjects with peanut allergy tended to have higher-fold change values (calculated expression level estimates of the sample against the negative controls) to the major peanut components Ara h 1 to 3, whereas the peanut-tolerant subjects had higher values to CCDs and grass components (Phl p 1, Phl p 4, and Phl p 5).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings from a Danish study suggest that additional peanut components not routinely included in test panels may play important roles for certain individuals. This study reported that 2 percent of positive challenges had undetectable Ara h 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], whereas another European study found that 26 percent of subjects who were tolerant to peanut showed IgE binding to Ara h 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, isolated sensitization to Ara h 8 is sometimes associated with positive challenges with systemic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20</a>]. As an example, a case was reported of a child with undetectable IgE to Ara h 2 and elevated IgE to Ara h 8 who experienced anaphylaxis at oral food challenge to peanut. After performing additional testing, he was found to have an elevated IgE to Ara h 6, a homologue of Ara h 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study has examined whether IgE levels to peanut components have prognostic value for persistence of disease. Sensitization to Ara h 1 to 3 at one year of age was associated with persistent peanut allergy at 13 years of age, but it did not provide independent predictive value in addition to the information provided by IgE levels to whole peanut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A United States study examined threshold levels of Ara h 2 in the diagnosis of symptomatic peanut allergy in a general pediatric allergy referral population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Isolated Ara h 8 sensitization (without detectable IgE to Ara h 1, 2, or 3) suggests low risk for systemic reactions to peanut. The risk of a reaction on oral food challenge is decreased in this population, but a challenge is probably still warranted to confirm lack of systemic reactivity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a young child who has experienced immediate systemic symptoms upon peanut ingestion, component testing is unlikely to provide additional information that would influence management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When considering a food challenge for peanut, we typically obtain component tests because of the potential for improved predictive value compared with the standard peanut test. Interpretation requires evaluation of the component-specific IgE concentrations and pattern of sensitization. As an example, isolated positive testing to Ara h 8 suggests unlikely allergy, whereas high levels of IgE to Ara h 2 may indicate probable allergy. Sensitization to multiple stable proteins (eg, Ara h 1, 2, and 3) may indicate a greater chance of reaction compared with isolated sensitization to just one of these proteins. The risk of reaction based upon testing and other patient factors (eg, asthma) is assessed when deciding whether to offer a medically supervised feeding test and also potentially where to perform the procedure (eg, office versus hospital).

Cor a 1 is a heat labile protein that is homologous with the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1. Sensitization to Cor a 1 is generally associated with tolerance to hazelnut or mild oropharyngeal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Sensitization to Cor a 8, an LTP, has been linked with more severe symptoms in patients from the Mediterranean area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Cor a 9 is an 11S globulin, and data have implicated sensitization to Cor a 9 in severe reactions in children in the United States and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies/abstract/23,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26,27</a>].

This type of testing is known as component-resolved diagnosis (CRD). (See <a href=\"#H9556903\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRD holds promise for distinguishing patients with clinical allergy as opposed to those sensitized, but tolerant to, plant-derived foods. It also has the potential to provide additional information regarding the severity of symptoms that may occur in clinically reactive individuals, with those sensitized to pollen-related proteins having a lower risk of severe systemic reactions with exposure. (See <a href=\"#H9556909\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two different types of immunoassays are commercially available: those that measure specific IgE to individual allergens (components) and those that measure specific IgE to multiple components simultaneously (microarrays). (See <a href=\"#H9556915\" class=\"local\">'Assay systems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For peanut allergy, data indicate that CRD can provide useful information for discriminating between pollen-related symptoms as opposed to primary peanut allergy, particularly in older individuals. This information can be used to facilitate patient selection of oral food challenges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F95963\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95963 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9556928\" class=\"local\">'Peanut'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further studies in larger populations are needed to determine the clinical utility of CRD for each different food. Oral food challenge remains the gold standard for food allergy diagnosis.
