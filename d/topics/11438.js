It can affect the whole heart or just part of it. Myocarditis is often caused by a virus or autoimmune disease. In autoimmune diseases, the body's infection-fighting system attacks healthy tissue instead of infections. Autoimmune diseases can cause inflammation in the heart and other parts of the body. Other things, such as certain medicines, can also cause myocarditis.</p><p>Myocarditis can be mild or severe. There are different forms of myocarditis. Many forms get better on their own. Others can cause serious heart problems and even death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12592089\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of myocarditis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myocarditis symptoms are different for each person. They depend on the type of myocarditis, the cause, and other factors. Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure &ndash; In this condition, the heart does not pump blood well. This can cause:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tiredness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Less ability to exercise</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Swelling of the feet and legs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trouble breathing &ndash; This can be all the time, just when active, or just when lying down.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in heartbeat, such as beating fast or seeming to skip a beat.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12592104\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you have any of the symptoms listed above. Tell him or her if you recently had a cold or the flu, got a vaccine, or started taking a new medicine. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12592119\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask you about your symptoms and do an exam. You might have some or all of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; These can measure the levels of enzymes that are normally in the heart. Myocarditis sometimes makes these enzymes leak out of the heart into the blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray &ndash; An X-ray can show if there is fluid in your lungs and if your heart is larger than it should be.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;) &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create an image of the heart. It allows doctors to measure the walls and chambers of the heart, see how the heart is pumping, and check how the heart valves are working. Heart valves are flaps of tissue that open and close like swinging doors. They help keep blood flowing through the heart in 1 direction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI &ndash; This is an imaging test that uses a strong magnet to create pictures of the inside of the body. It can show the size of the heart and how well it is working. It can also show if there is damage to the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac catheterization (also called &quot;cardiac cath&quot;) &ndash; During this test, the doctor puts a short tube called a &quot;sheath&quot; into a blood vessel in your leg or arm. The doctor can then pass a narrower tube or tools through the sheath to:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Measure pressures inside your heart and blood vessels</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do a test called &quot;coronary angiography&quot; &ndash; In this test, the doctor puts a dye that shows up on X-rays into the tube. This test can show if any of the arteries in your heart are narrowed or blocked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do a test called a &quot;biopsy&quot; &ndash; In this test, the doctor puts a tiny tool through the tube. He or she uses the tool to take a small piece of tissue from the heart. Another doctor looks at the tissue under a microscope to see what is wrong with the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12592136\"><span class=\"h1\">How is myocarditis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for myocarditis depends on how severe it is and what caused it. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Depending on the situation, doctors can give medicines to:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Help you breathe better</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Keep fluid from building up</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Help keep the heart beating correctly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stop blood clots from forming inside the body</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines which partly &quot;turn off&quot; the immune system</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest &ndash; Talk to your doctor about how much activity is right for you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen &ndash; Some people need to breathe oxygen from a tank they carry with them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Not</strong> drinking alcohol, or having no more than 1 drink a day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If myocarditis is severe, you might need other treatments. These include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Devices that a doctor puts in the body. Some devices help keep the heart beating correctly. Others help the heart pump blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heart transplant &ndash; In this surgery, a doctor replaces a diseased heart with a healthy heart.</p><p/><p>People with myocarditis need to see a doctor or nurse regularly, even after they feel better. They also need tests to check how well the heart is working. This is because myocarditis can sometimes cause heart problems later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12592151\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilated-cardiomyopathy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dilated cardiomyopathy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chest pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
