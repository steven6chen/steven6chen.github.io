In addition to efficacy, these agents have the additional advantage of being particularly well tolerated since they produce few idiosyncratic side effects and do not have the adverse effects on lipid and glucose metabolism seen with higher doses of diuretics or beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

These include hypotension, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and problems during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are other complications (cough, angioedema, and anaphylactoid reactions) that are thought to be related to increased kinins since ACE is also a kininase (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Cough'</a> below). This is an important distinction clinically because the side effects related to reduced angiotensin II, but not those related to kinins, are also seen with the angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).

First-dose hypotension, which can be marked in hypovolemic patients with high baseline renin levels, can be minimized by not beginning therapy if the patient is volume depleted and by discontinuing prior diuretic therapy for three to five days. Hypotension can also occur after the initiation of therapy in patients with congestive heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The risk can be minimized by beginning with a very low dose, such as 2.5 mg BID of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a>.

As an example, an elevation in serum creatinine sufficiently severe to warrant discontinuation of the drug occurred in 0.7 percent of the patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramipril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramipril</a> in the ONTARGET trial, which enrolled patients with vascular disease or high-risk diabetes. A doubling of the serum creatinine in this trial occurred in 1.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Blocking this response with an ACE inhibitor will sequentially relax the efferent arteriole, lower intraglomerular pressure, and reduce the GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients with acute volume loss due to vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea may be particularly susceptible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The rise in the serum creatinine concentration generally begins a few days after the institution of therapy since angiotensin II levels are rapidly reduced. Thus, renal function should be checked at three to five days when an ACE inhibitor is begun in a patient who has renal artery stenosis or who is at high risk for this problem (as in an older patient with severe hypertension and atherosclerotic vascular disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Even with optimal management, some patients are unable to tolerate the administration of ACE inhibitors. Termination of the ACE inhibitor should be considered if hyperkalemia cannot be controlled (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Hyperkalemia'</a> below) or the serum creatinine concentration increases more than 30 percent above the baseline value within the first six to eight weeks when blood pressure is reduced. Such a decline in renal function is uncommon if the patient is not volume depleted, diuretics have been transiently withheld prior to initiation of therapy, and the patient does not have bilateral renovascular disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another rare cause of acute renal failure that is of unproven relation to ACE inhibitors is the development of renal artery thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This complication appears to occur most often in patients with marked (&ge;95 percent) stenotic lesions who have an excessive reduction in blood pressure. It is therefore unclear whether there is any specific predisposing effect of the ACE inhibitor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperkalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiotensin II and an elevation in the plasma potassium concentration are the major factors that increase the release of aldosterone, which is the major hormonal stimulus to urinary potassium excretion. In addition to the direct effect of systemic angiotensin II, angiotensin II generated locally within the adrenal zona glomerulosa may mediate the potassium-induced stimulation of aldosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Blocking both of these actions with an ACE inhibitor will reduce aldosterone secretion, thereby impairing the efficiency of urinary potassium excretion.</p><p>The overall incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as a serum potassium concentration above 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> in patients treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB is approximately 3.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, there is a marked variability in risk. ACE inhibitors generally raise the serum potassium concentration by less than 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in patients with relatively normal renal function. More prominent hyperkalemia may be seen in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes, concurrent use of a drug promoting potassium retention such as a potassium-sparing diuretic or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or among older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p>Patients with moderately severe to severe heart failure represent a setting in which multiple factors can contribute to the development of hyperkalemia. These include decreased renal perfusion due to the fall in cardiac output and, often, combined therapy with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

This was shown in a prospective study of 251 hemodialysis patients in which there was an association between a predialysis serum potassium concentration of &ge;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and the use of an ACE inhibitor or ARB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Use of these agents was associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia (odds ratio of 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.4), which was observed in patients with and without residual renal function. Dietary measures were the only intervention required to manage the hyperkalemia. Anuria appears to be particularly associated with an increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In this report of 29 stable normokalemic peritoneal dialysis patients, the risk of hyperkalemia with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB was principally observed among those undergoing inadequate dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">(Kt/V</span> less than 2.0) or with low solute transport characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>There are several mechanisms by which angiotensin II inhibition can lead to hyperkalemia in patients with end-stage renal disease: decreased urinary potassium excretion in patients with residual renal function; and decreased colonic excretion that accounts for a significant percentage of total potassium loss in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Among hemodialysis patients first receiving an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, more frequent measurement of the serum potassium concentration should be performed for one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Once stable, monthly measurements are recommended.</p><p>Among patients with chronic kidney disease who are not dialysis dependent, issues surrounding the use of ACE inhibitors and hyperkalemia are discussed separately.

The best data come from a meta-analysis of 29 trials in which cough was noted in 9.9 percent of patients treated with ACE inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In the ONTARGET trial, cough sufficiently severe to discontinue the drug was observed in 4.2 percent of the patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramipril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramipril</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'ARBs'</a> below.)</p><p>The cough has the following clinical features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It usually begins within one to two weeks of instituting therapy, but it can be delayed up to six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women are affected more frequently than men.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chinese, at least in Hong Kong, have a high prevalence that approaches 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It typically resolves within one to four days of discontinuing therapy, but this can take up to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It generally recurs with rechallenge, either with the same or a different ACE inhibitor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It does not occur more frequently in patients with asthma, but it may be accompanied by bronchospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p>The mechanism responsible for the ACE inhibitor-induced cough is not known, but increased local concentrations of kinins, substance P, prostaglandins, or thromboxane may be important:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both kinins and substance P are metabolized by converting enzyme; thus, their levels are increased by converting enzyme inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Kinins, for example, may induce bronchial irritation and cough via enhanced production of prostaglandins, which may then stimulate afferent C-fibers in the airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of the arachidonic acid pathway with ACE inhibition may also lead to elevated levels of thromboxane, which can potentiate bronchoconstriction. The possible role of thromboxane in ACE inhibitor-induced cough was evaluated in a double-blind crossover study of nine patients who had developed cough while taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The patients were treated with placebo or picotamide (600 mg BID), an agent that inhibits thromboxane synthetase and antagonizes the thromboxane receptor. Active therapy resulted in a significant reduction in thromboxane levels and stopped the cough in eight of the nine patients within 72 hours. Inadequate absorption of picotamide occurred in the one nonresponder.</p><p/><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> can reportedly improve the cough related to ACE inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. However, these have not been studied in large trials, and some may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, particularly among individuals with decreased kidney function.</p><p>It remains unclear why cough occurs only in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors. It has been suggested that genetic factors may be important. However, common genetic variants for ACE, the B2 bradykinin receptor, or chymase (another enzyme that can convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II) do not explain the variation in susceptibility to cough.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5361360\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the ACE inhibitor is discontinued, improvement often begins within four to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].
