In a prospective study of 4388 solid organ transplant recipients at 16 transplant centers in Spain, the incidence of TB was 512 cases per 100,000 patients per year compared with 19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Lung transplant recipients are most likely to develop pulmonary manifestations of TB, although disseminated disease also occurs in a substantial proportion of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Furthermore, TB may have an atypical presentation in this population (eg, pyomyositis, cutaneous ulcers or abscess, tenosynovitis).</p><p>Fever occurred in 91 percent of solid organ transplant recipients with disseminated TB and 64 percent of those with localized TB; night sweats and weight loss were also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only a small minority of transplant patients has classic cavitary changes on chest radiograph. Radiographic findings of pulmonary TB in solid organ transplant recipients have included a focal infiltrate (40 percent), a miliary pattern (22 percent), nodules (15 percent), pleural effusions (13 percent), diffuse interstitial infiltrates (5 percent), and cavities (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

TB should be considered in all transplant recipients with unexplained fevers, night sweats, and weight loss and in all lung transplant recipients with evidence of pulmonary infection. Staining and culture for acid-fast bacilli should be performed on all induced sputum and bronchoscopy specimens in such patients. Nucleic acid amplification methods can increase the rapidity of diagnosis when the suspicion for TB is high. In addition, mycobacterial infections should be considered in transplant recipients with atypical skin lesions or soft tissue infections. Skin biopsy specimens <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abscess fluid should be sent for acid-fast bacilli staining and culture and histopathology. It should be noted that neither tuberculin skin testing nor interferon-gamma release assays distinguish between active and latent TB.

Data regarding the safety and efficacy of TB therapy in solid organ transplant recipients come from retrospective studies, case reports, and case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/4,19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19-25</a>].

However, the following important issues specific to solid organ transplant recipients should be noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The AST states that a rifamycin-containing regimen is strongly preferred for both severe and localized nonsevere TB due to the potent sterilizing activity of such regimens and the importance of preventing the emergence of resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TBNET and ESCMID suggest a non-rifamycin&ndash;based regimen in cases of localized (eg, pulmonary) nonsevere TB when there is no suspicion or evidence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> (INH) resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>].

In those receiving a three-drug regimen for the entirety, the duration of treatment can be shortened to 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experts agree that rifamycins are indicated in patients with severe (eg, cavitary or multilobar disease) or disseminated TB or when there is suspicion or documentation of INH resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a> should be used with caution due to significant interactions between this class of drug and the calcineurin inhibitors and rapamycin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>). The rifamycins (especially rifampin) reduce serum concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, rapamycin (sirolimus), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> via induction of the cytochrome p450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, and the combination of a rifamycin with these drugs has been associated with the development of rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/7,10,19,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,19,26</a>]. Rifamycins also reduce levels of glucocorticoids, although this has been less well characterized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> is used, the dose of the calcineurin inhibitor or rapamycin should be increased approximately three- to fivefold, and serum concentrations should be monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. CYP3A4 induction by rifampin takes several days to occur, usually peaks within a week, and lasts for days to weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifabutin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifabutin</a> is an attractive alternative to rifampin because it has similar activity against <em>M. tuberculosis</em> but is a weaker inducer of cytochrome p450 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/7,10,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,29-31</a>]. While there is less experience with rifabutin in the treatment of TB in transplant recipients, it appears effective in HIV-infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>].

Some experts recommend that treatment should be continued for at least nine months in all solid organ transplant recipients, since a shorter duration may be associated with increased mortality in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> is often used as part of the initial treatment regimen in non-transplant patients with a contraindication to the rifamycins, this agent is generally avoided in solid organ transplant recipients because of the risk of nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TB treatment regimen will depend on local resistance patterns and epidemiologic and susceptibility data from the individual patient's isolate.

Antituberculous therapy reverses the immunosuppressive effects associated with TB infection, and IRIS may manifest with a paradoxical worsening of pulmonary infiltrates, fever, pleural or pericardial effusion, or lymphadenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a multicenter prospective study of TB in transplant recipients, IRIS developed in 9 of 64 patients (14.1 percent) at a median of 47 days after initiation of anti-TB medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The presence of two or more of the following factors was associated with increased risk of IRIS: liver transplantation, previous cytomegalovirus infection, and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>. There was no association noted between reduction of immunosuppression and IRIS, however, as very few patients had dose reductions.

In a literature review published in 1998 of TB in solid organ transplant recipients, 146 of 499 patients (29 percent) died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Predictors of mortality included disseminated disease, prior rejection, and receipt of OKT3 or anti&ndash;T cell antibodies. However, in another study, disseminated disease was not associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Newer studies demonstrate decreasing mortality rates due to TB in SOT. In a prospective study of TB among solid organ transplant recipients, crude mortality was 19 percent, but mortality attributable to TB was only 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a multicenter study with 64 cases of TB in two subsequent SOT cohorts, the later cohort (2008 to 2011) had a mortality of 10 percent as well. Further, the increased risk of rejection caused by the interaction between the rifamycins and the calcineurin inhibitors was previously thought to contribute to the morbidity of TB in solid organ transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, two multicenter studies in which the majority of patients received a rifampin-based regimen did not show a difference in rejection rates or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>If immunosuppression is reduced upon starting TB treatment, there is also the possibility of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, as is seen in HIV patients who receive antiretroviral therapy along with antituberculous medicines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Neither the TST nor IGRA detects the mycobacterium directly; both are dependent on the host's cellular immune response to the pathogen. Just as TST can be negative due to cutaneous anergy, IGRA results are reported as indeterminate when there is an inadequate interferon-gamma response to the positive control, which can be the result of a diminished cellular immune response or technical issues in collecting the sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Our approach to screening for latent TB depends in part upon the patient's type and degree of organ dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F102601\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102601 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For solid organ transplant candidates who do not have end-stage renal disease or advanced liver disease, we use either the TST or the IGRA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the TST is performed and is negative, it should be repeated two weeks later if feasible in order to detect the booster effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>].

In a Spanish study of 95 patients awaiting liver transplant, the rate of positive TST decreased with more advanced stages of liver disease, whereas IGRA positivity showed no association with stage of liver disease, suggesting that IGRA may be superior to TST in patients with advanced liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the IGRA gives an indeterminate result, it should be repeated to make sure there are no technical or laboratory flaws. If the repeat result is also indeterminate, then the clinician cannot rely on the IGRA for clinical decision-making, except to assume that the patient is probably not able to mount an interferon-gamma response to mitogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. For those with two indeterminate IGRAs, the decision regarding the need for treatment of latent TB will need to be made on a case-by-case basis according to the individual's risk-benefit ratio, with consideration of signs of prior infection (eg, granulomas on chest imaging), prior contact with people with known disease, other history of probable exposures, and risk of drug toxicities.

However, the increased risk of reactivation and severe disease among solid organ transplant recipients argues for initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> prophylaxis, particularly in regions in which TB is endemic. In most cases, the benefit of treatment of latent TB outweighs the risks in the transplant setting. The annual risk for active TB in immunocompromised transplant recipients with a positive TST may be as high as 7.4 percent without treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In a European study of immunocompromised patients, the overall incidence of active TB was low, but no cases occurred in patients who received treatment for latent TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Moreover, studies have shown a low risk of isoniazid hepatotoxicity in renal transplant recipients without serious liver disease and in patients with compensated liver disease awaiting liver transplantation who have had close follow-up and monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>].</p><p>It is optimal to treat latent TB prior to transplantation, although it is also acceptable to treat following transplantation when necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Treating prior to transplantation is especially challenging in liver transplant candidates who may not tolerate the potential hepatoxicity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> (INH). Treatment prior to transplantation can be attempted with very close monitoring of liver function tests. However, in such cases, it may be safer to begin therapy after transplantation once liver function has normalized. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious complications in liver transplantation&quot;, section on 'Tuberculosis'</a>.)</p><p>Practices for the management of latent TB among transplant candidates and recipients vary in different countries, largely due to differences in the regional prevalence of TB.</p><p>Transplant candidates and recipients should be treated for latent TB if any of the following criteria are met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial or boosted TST with induration &ge;5 mm or a positive IGRA</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of untreated latent TB</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Receiving an organ from a donor known to have untreated latent TB</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In deceased donors, untreated latent TB can be difficult to diagnose based on history from family members alone. TST is not feasible due to time limitations, and IGRA is not always logistically feasible. In a study of 105 deceased donors from Germany, detection of antigen-specific cellular immunity to TB was compared using two different IGRA methods and flow cytometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Despite the variability in the assay results and higher rates of indeterminate results compared with living donors, there may be a role for positive IGRA results to guide decisions about chemoprophylaxis, which deserves further study. In contrast, living donors can be screened with TST or IGRA; in those with untreated latent TB, we recommend treating the recipient post-transplant (as well as the donor, if indicated). When transplantation is nonurgent, the donor can be treated for latent TB prior to transplant when feasible. If the donor is fully treated prior to transplantation, it is not necessary to treat the recipient.</p><p/><p>Transplant candidates with recent close and prolonged contact with an individual with active TB should be considered for latent TB treatment even with negative TST or IGRA, given the high risk of primary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>For patients who have an indeterminate IGRA on repeat testing for an initial indeterminate result, we consider the risk of latent TB and treat those at high risk.

In regions in which endemic mycoses are common and TB is uncommon (eg, parts of the United States), such an evaluation is important to ensure that individuals are not treated unnecessarily for latent TB.</p><p>For treatment of latent TB, we recommend oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum dose 300 mg) daily for adults and 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum dose 300 mg) daily for children for a duration of nine months; oral pyridoxine 25 to 50 mg daily should also be administered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65944 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>].
