This can cause symptoms. The fast heartbeat can come and go suddenly. Sometimes, a fast heartbeat goes back to normal on its own. Other times, treatment is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H560846830\"><span class=\"h1\">How do normal heartbeats happen?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A normal heartbeat happens when an electrical signal starts in one spot near the top of the heart. This electrical signal follows a path to spread across the heart. As it spreads, the signal causes the heart muscle to squeeze. Each time the heart squeezes, blood is sent all over the body. Normally, the heart beats in a regular way 60 to 80 times a minute.</p><p>People can have abnormal heartbeats if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The electrical signal does not start in the right place</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The electrical signal does not follow the right path as it spreads across the heart</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H560846837\"><span class=\"h1\">Why is the heartbeat abnormal in WPW syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The heartbeat can be abnormal in WPW syndrome, because people with WPW syndrome have an abnormal extra path in the heart. When the electrical signal follows the abnormal extra path, the heart can beat at a rate that is much faster than normal.</p><p>Some people have an abnormal extra path in their heart, but they do not have a fast heartbeat. These people do not have any symptoms and do not have WPW syndrome. Instead, they have a &quot;WPW pattern.&quot; These people usually do not need treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H560846844\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of WPW syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with WPW syndrome can have symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling their heart beating too fast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or light-headed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting</p><p/><p>Most people with WPW syndrome do not have any other heart problems, but some do. People with WPW syndrome who have other heart problems can have more serious symptoms. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p/><p>WPW syndrome can be life-threatening, because it can cause sudden death. But this is rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H560846851\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for WPW syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors can diagnose WPW syndrome by doing a test called an &quot;electrocardiogram&quot; (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>). An ECG measures the electrical activity in the heart. It can show if a person has an abnormal heart rhythm or rate.</p><p>Sometimes, a doctor will do another procedure to figure out where the extra path is and if it needs to be treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H560846858\"><span class=\"h1\">How is WPW syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>WPW syndrome is treated in different ways. Some treatments can stop episodes of fast heartbeats. Other treatments can prevent episodes of fast heartbeats from happening in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H560846865\"><span class=\"h1\">What treatments can stop a fast heartbeat?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments that can control a fast heartbeat include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Actions &ndash; Actions that people can do themselves include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coughing or &quot;bearing down&quot; &ndash; Bearing down is when a person tightens his or her belly as if he or she is trying to have a bowel movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pressing on and massaging the main artery on the side of the neck</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called &quot;cardioversion&quot; &ndash; During cardioversion, a doctor gives a person's heart an electric shock to stop the fast heartbeat. This allows the heart to beat normally again.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H560846872\"><span class=\"h1\">What treatments can prevent future episodes of fast heartbeats?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments that can prevent future episodes of fast heartbeats include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called &quot;radiofrequency catheter ablation&quot; &ndash; This procedure can stop the abnormal path from spreading the electrical signal. During the procedure, a doctor puts thin wires into the blood vessels in the groin (inner thigh) or another part of the body. He or she threads the wires up through the blood vessels and into the heart. Then he or she uses the wires to disconnect the abnormal path.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Some people need to take medicines every day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; A doctor can do surgery to disconnect the abnormal path in the heart. But radiofrequency catheter ablation is done far more often than surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H560846879\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-for-the-heart-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Catheter ablation for the heart (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pacemakers (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-for-abnormal-heartbeats-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Catheter ablation for abnormal heartbeats (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioversion-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cardioversion (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
