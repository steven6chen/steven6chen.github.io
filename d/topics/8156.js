Of these, 240 million are chronic carriers and approximately 686,000 hepatitis B related deaths occur annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Despite advances in antiviral therapy, only a minority of patients with chronic hepatitis B will have a sustained response. Thus, primary prevention by vaccination to increase herd immunity remains the main focus in controlling HBV infection.</p><p>The commonly used hepatitis B vaccines are extremely safe and have an efficacy of &gt;90 percent against all HBV serotypes and genotypes. Thus, HBV infection can potentially be eradicated through global vaccination. Globally, vaccine coverage based upon completion of the third dose of vaccine (HepB3) has increased from 3 percent in 1992 to 84 percent in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. However, even in countries that actively advocate universal vaccination, coverage is less than 100 percent. As an example, the vaccine coverage in Taiwan for birth cohorts from 1984 to 2010 was 88.8 to 96.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, vaccine coverage among adults is low, and the overall prevalence of hepatitis B vaccine-induced immunity was 25 percent during the period from 2007 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In 2010, vaccine coverage ranged from 58 percent for those between 18 and 20 years old to 26 percent for those between 41 and 49 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In high-risk adults, vaccine coverage for those between 19 and 49 years was 42 percent, while the coverage rate for low-risk adults in the same age range was 33 percent. Despite this suboptimal vaccine coverage, the incidence of acute hepatitis B has decreased by 90 percent in the United States (from 8.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/100,000</span> in 1990 to 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">9/100,000</span> in 2012) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, new infections continue to be seen, especially among young adults who use injection drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology of chronic HBV'</a>.)</p><p>While vaccination represents the cornerstone of public health measures to eradicate HBV, 5 to 10 percent of individuals do not respond to currently available vaccines. Thus, other public health measures, including health education and infection control measures, remain important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF VACCINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of hepatitis B vaccine is considered to be one of the major achievements of modern medicine. This section will review available vaccines. A discussion of novel approaches to vaccination is found below. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'New developments'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3435692528\"><span class=\"h2\">Single antigen vaccines</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1361159931\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-adjuvanted vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three different classes of single antigen recombinant hepatitis B vaccines available; these are derived from plasma, yeast, or mammalian cells. The recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (non-adjuvanted) derived from yeast is most commonly used. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first generation hepatitis B vaccine was prepared by concentrating and purifying plasma from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers to produce 22 nm subviral particles, which contained HBsAg alone. Derivation from plasma left lingering concerns regarding the potential to transmit blood-borne infections, although this vaccine had excellent efficacy and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As a result, the plasma-derived vaccine is no longer used in most developed countries. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The cost of both the plasma-derived and recombinant HBV vaccine have decreased due to expiration of patent protection and competition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Because the difference in cost is marginal, many countries have switched to the recombinant vaccine. With the decrease in price of vaccine, organizations like the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) will be able to assist an increasing number of countries in implementing universal HBV vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yeast-derived recombinant hepatitis B vaccines were first introduced in the mid-1980s. They are produced by cloning of the HBV S gene in yeast cells. These vaccines contain non-glycosylated HBV small S protein as the envelope antigen which must be released from the yeast during the manufacturing process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These vaccines do not contain antigens of the pre-S regions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The original versions of the yeast-derived recombinant vaccines contained thimerosal (an organic mercurial) as a preservative. Although there has been no evidence of harm caused by the level of exposure children encounter during existing immunization schedules, there was concern about the potential risk of abnormal neurodevelopment. This prompted a joint statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United States Public Health Service calling for the removal of thimerosal-containing vaccines. Two yeast-derived recombinant thimerosal-free vaccines have subsequently been developed (Recombivax HB and Engerix-B) and are widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third class of hepatitis B vaccine is the mammalian cell-derived recombinant vaccine. Three vaccines of this class have been developed. In addition to the S antigen, one of these contain antigen from the pre-S2 region while the other two contain antigens from both the pre-S1 and pre-S2 regions. A controlled trial suggested that this class of vaccine was associated with an enhanced immunologic response compared to Engerix-B in a three-dose regimen and was equally effective in a two-dose regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although vaccines with pre-S antigens may be more immunogenic, they are not widely available and are not routinely recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2140681630\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjuvanted vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvanted-recombinant-hepatitis-b-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adjuvanted recombinant hepatitis B vaccine</a> (HEPLISAV) consisting of HBsAg with an adjuvant immunostimulatory phosphorothioate oligodeoxyribonucleotide (HBV-ISS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] has received conditional approval for use in adults 18 years of age and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The vaccine is administered as two intramuscular doses given one month apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. According to data provided by the manufacturer, this vaccine appears more immunogenic than the non-adjuvanted vaccines in healthy adults, those over age 40 (who tend to have a lower response rate), and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It is not clear when this vaccine will be available outside of the United States. </p><p>The most common adverse reactions reported within seven days of vaccination were injection site pain (23 to 39 percent), fatigue (11 to 17 percent), and headache (8 to 17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, there are outstanding concerns about an increase in acute myocardial infarction and immune mediated disorders, and a phase 4 study to address these concerns will be conducted. Thus, the optimal use of this vaccine is still to be determined. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3940387554\"><span class=\"h2\">Combination vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hepatitis B vaccine has been successfully combined with several other vaccines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis A vaccine</a>, and a vaccine that combines diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, and inactivated poliovirus. The immunogenicity of these multivalent vaccines is similar to that of the univalent vaccines. These combination vaccines reduce the number of injections, resulting in higher compliance. </p><p>The combination vaccine that includes both the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (non-adjuvanted) and the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis A vaccine</a> (Twinrix, GlaxoSmithKline), has been approved for use in adults in the United States and Europe, and in children in some countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Approval was based upon data from 1551 study participants from 11 clinical trials who received Twinrix on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. An immune response against hepatitis A and B was observed in 99.9 and 98.5 percent of vaccinees, respectively. An accelerated dosing schedule (with doses given at 0, 7, and 21 to 30 days, and a booster at 12 months) has also been approved. Its main potential advantage is convenience and improved compliance for those who require vaccination against both hepatitis viruses.</p><p>A more detailed discussion of the combination vaccine that includes diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, acellular pertussis, recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (non-adjuvanted), and inactivated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">poliovirus vaccine</a> (Pediatrix) is found elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-immunization-in-infants-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus immunization in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Recommendations for screening the adult population have been issued by several major organizations including the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD), and the World Health Organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. The USPSTF provides a strong recommendation for screening women during their first prenatal visit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy#H50247993\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Prevention of mother-to-child transmission'</a>.)</p><p>The AASLD supports CDC's recommendation regarding screening of high risk groups and vaccinating those who are not already immune or infected. This includes (in addition to pregnant women) persons born in high or intermediate endemic areas (countries with hepatitis B virus [HBV] prevalence rate &gt;2 percent), United States-born persons not vaccinated as infants whose parents were born in regions with high HBV endemicity, persons with chronically elevated aminotransferases, persons needing immunosuppressive therapy, men who have sex with men, persons with multiple sexual partners or history of sexually transmitted disease, inmates of correctional facilities, persons who have ever used injecting drugs, patients on dialysis, HIV or HCV-infected patients, and family members, household members, and sexual contacts of HBV-infected persons.

The timing of the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine and the need for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> (HBIG) are determined by the mother's hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) status, the infant's gestational age, and the infant's birth weight. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-immunization-in-infants-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus immunization in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H846927985\" class=\"local\">'Neonates of HBsAg-positive mothers'</a> below.)</p><p>Universal vaccination of all newborns, regardless of maternal HBsAg status, is necessary for global eradication of HBV infection. However, as of 2015, global coverage of birth dose hepatitis B vaccine remains low at only 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/7,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,30</a>]. Countries that have adopted universal vaccination of newborns have experienced a marked reduction in carrier rates as well as complications from HBV including hepatocellular carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. As an example, the reduction in carrier rates ranged from 16 percent before implementation of the program to 0 percent after implementation in Alaska. Reductions were also seen in Samoa (7 percent to 0.5 percent) and Micronesia (12 to 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>In Taiwan, vaccination of newborns of carrier mothers was implemented in July 1984 and extended to all neonates in 1986. At the start of the program, the HBV carrier rate among children younger than 15 years of age was 9.8 percent and the incidence of childhood hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 1.02 and 0.48 per 100,000 male and female children, respectively. Twenty years into the program, the HBV carrier rate among children of the same age group decreased to 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Thirty years later, the prevalence of HBsAg among those younger than 30 years decreased to 0.5 percent; most children with vaccine failure were born to HBsAg-positive mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In addition, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in children and young adults has decreased by more than 80 percent, and the mortality from chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma has decreased by more than 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>These findings demonstrate that universal vaccination can prevent vertical and horizontal transmission of HBV infection as well as the sequelae of chronic HBV infection. In countries with low endemicity, the benefits of universal neonatal vaccination will not be apparent until two to three decades later because infection in these countries usually occurs among adolescents and young adults through percutaneous or sexual routes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H846927985\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonates of HBsAg-positive mothers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccination of neonates born to HBsAg-positive mothers is the most important step toward the eradication of chronic HBV infection. Vaccination of such infants is extremely cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The cost-effectiveness is further improved with the expiration of patent for HBV vaccines. </p><p>The standard regimen for neonates born to HBsAg-positive mothers consists of passive and active immunization. Hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG are given at the same time at two different sites within 12 hours of delivery. The neonates should then receive two additional doses of the hepatitis B vaccine at months 1 to 2 and months 6 to 12. This regimen has a protective efficacy of 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. A more detailed discussion of hepatitis B vaccination of neonates is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-immunization-in-infants-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus immunization in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Studies in Taiwan and Hong Kong found that the protective efficacy of hepatitis B vaccine alone was significantly lower (only 75 to 80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. One study from Thailand found that three doses of hepatitis B vaccine without coadministration of HBIG achieved equivalent protective rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, a similar study was conducted later in the same country to investigate the efficacy of administering the vaccine alone without HBIG to neonates of mothers who were positive for HBeAg. The efficacy of this regimen was between 82 and 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>These data indicate that vaccination alone is insufficient to prevent transmission of HBV infection from HBeAg positive mothers to their infants and vaccination alone should only be considered in countries that cannot afford the cost of HBIG. A statement by the USPSTF noted that the current practice of vaccinating all infants against HBV infection and post-exposure prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> administered at birth to all HBV-infected mothers substantially reduces the risk for acquiring HBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>However, mother-to-child transmission of HBV can still occur when HBIG and the first dose of the HBV vaccine are administered within 24 hours of birth and the remaining course of HBV vaccination is completed. These cases of vaccine failure arise when the mothers are HBsAg positive with high serum HBV DNA levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Clinical trials have shown that antiviral therapy administered to HBsAg-positive mothers with high viremia starting in the third trimester of pregnancy together with timely administration of HBIG and HBV vaccine can further reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission. A more detailed discussion of antiviral therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission is found elsewhere.

All unvaccinated children and adolescents &lt;19 years should receive the HBV vaccine series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. As most of these children are school-age, catch-up vaccination permits these children to be immunized before they reach adolescence when they are at risk of infection through sexual exposure and injection drug use. </p><p>The progress of catch-up vaccination in the United States has been fairly successful. In 2013, vaccine coverage among adolescents aged 13 to 15 was over 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, the coverage has been more variable among Asian and Pacific Islander children in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In cities with a catch-up vaccination program for these high-risk children, the coverage was 51 to 67 percent. In cities without such a program, the coverage was 14 to 18 percent. These results suggest a need for continued vaccination programs for this population. </p><p>Despite the push for catch-up vaccination, the vaccination coverage for hepatitis B in adults remains low at 24.5 percent for adults above 19 years old, 32.2 percent for adults aged 19 to 49, and 15.7 percent for adults above 50 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Nevertheless, every effort should still be made to vaccinate high-risk individuals.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexually active individuals with multiple sex partners and homosexual or bisexual males &ndash; Clinics focusing on sexually transmitted diseases can be strategic for advocating hepatitis B vaccination in this group of patients. In the Sentinel Counties Study of Viral Hepatitis in 1996, 42 percent of patients with acute hepatitis B had been treated for STD in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Despite this opportunity, a survey in United States found that of 65 federally funded STD programs, only 47 percent of the project managers thought that hepatitis B vaccination was the responsibility of their programs. Twenty-four percent offered hepatitis B vaccine in some or all of their clinics and only 27 percent had policies that provided for vaccination of clients less than 19 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Steady sexual partners of individuals with chronic HBV infection should be tested and vaccinated against hepatitis B if found to be seronegative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Household contacts of patients with hepatitis B &ndash; Many countries have listed hepatitis B as a notifiable disease. Household contacts, especially sexual contacts of individuals with chronic HBV infection should be tested and those who are seronegative, should be vaccinated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection drug users &ndash; Despite warning and education on the harmful effects of injection drug use, it is unrealistic to expect a change in habit to have any impact in controlling the transmission of hepatitis B in this group. Vaccination is the best method for primary prevention. Strategic locations to actively promote hepatitis B vaccination include detoxification, counseling and correction centers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health care workers &ndash; Vaccination programs of health care workers have met with the most success.

For older patients with diabetes, vaccination can be administered at the discretion of the treating clinician based on the risk of acquiring HBV and the likelihood of an adequate immune response to vaccination. The recommendation was based on outbreaks of HBV in patients who were undergoing assisted blood glucose monitoring, a subsequent analysis of the risk of acquiring HBV among all diabetics in the United States, and a cost-effectiveness analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with markers of past infection do not need vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have serologic markers of past HBV infection (anti-HBc and anti-HBs positive) do not need HBV vaccination even if they have low titers of anti-HBs. Such patients will be able to mount an appropriate immune response should they be rechallenged with HBV. Persons with isolated anti-HBc (HBsAg and anti-HBs negative) who have risk factors for HBV infection including having grown up in high endemic areas likely had prior exposure and do not require vaccination. However, persons who are positive only for anti-HBc and who are from a low endemic area with no risk factors for HBV should be given the full series of hepatitis B vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVACCINATION SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of prevaccination screening is to identify individuals who do not require vaccination and thereby reduce unnecessary vaccination. The need for prevaccination screening should be guided by the likelihood that an individual has been exposed to HBV since the administration of hepatitis B vaccine to individuals who are infected or immune will not result in any adverse outcome. A report based upon commercial retail rate of the hepatitis B vaccine in the United States suggested that preimmunization testing is cost-effective in populations in which the prevalence of infection exceeds 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In non-endemic areas, prevaccination screening is unnecessary since the costs of screening outweigh that of savings on the vaccine. Exceptions are patients in high-risk groups in whom screening should be performed by testing for anti-HBs antibodies. Additional testing for HBsAg among high risk groups is recommended by the CDC to identify those who might already be infected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In endemic areas, prevaccination screening should be performed in adults since the prevalence of past and current infection may exceed 50 percent. A cost-effectiveness analysis that considered screening and vaccinating Asian and Pacific islanders (groups where HBV is endemic) found that a screen-and-vaccinate strategy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,088 per quality adjusted life-years gained (ie, highly cost-effective) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The comparison was a universal vaccination strategy (in which all individuals are given a three-dose vaccination series). Prevaccination screening in these high risk populations is also important in identifying infected persons who may benefit from treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In these countries, screening can be performed by a single test for anti-HBc alone, which will detect individuals with past or current infection, or by a combination of tests for HBsAg and anti-HBs. While a single test for anti-HBc may be more economical, it does not differentiate carriers from individuals who have recovered from previous infection. In addition, several studies have found that a significant proportion of individuals who test positive for anti-HBc are negative for HBsAg and anti-HBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Early studies using anti-HBc assays that were less specific found that as many as 80 percent of these individuals with isolated anti-HBc developed a primary anti-HBs response to hepatitis B vaccine, suggesting that the anti-HBc test result was false positive but the accuracy of anti-HBc assays have improved in the last two decades. In endemic areas, the combination of HBsAg and anti-HBs testing is preferred. This strategy will also allow the identification of carriers who can be followed and treated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2660719170\"><span class=\"h1\">ADMINISTRATION OF HEPATITIS B VACCINE (NON-ADJUVANTED)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The discussion below focuses on the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-hepatitis-b-vaccine-non-adjuvanted-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant hepatitis B vaccines (non-adjuvanted)</a>.

Administering the birth dose serves as a &quot;safety net&quot; to prevent perinatal infection among infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers who were not identified because of erroneous maternal HBsAg testing or failure in reporting test results. In addition to providing early protection among infants at risk of perinatal infection, it is also associated with higher rates of on-time completion of the hepatitis B vaccine series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Slight flexibility is permitted in the vaccination schedule for infants born to mothers with negative HBsAg status. The first dose should be administered before hospital discharge, the second dose at 1 to 2 months, and the third dose at 6 to 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Vaccines should be administered intramuscularly since deposition of the vaccine into adipose tissue result in a lower seroconversion rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Although the level of 10 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> was arbitrarily chosen, clinical studies suggest that vaccinees with anti-HBs titer above this level are protected. The significance of this titer was illustrated in a five-year follow-up study of 773 homosexual men vaccinated in 1980; the acute infection rate increased seven times when the anti-HBs titer decreased below the level of 10 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Using the definition of &gt;10 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> anti-HBs as a positive response, the overall seroconversion rate is about 95 percent in healthy adults.

Testing should be performed one to two months after completion of the primary vaccination series (except for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers in whom testing should be performed at age 9 to 12 months of age or one to two months after the last dose of hepatitis B vaccine if immunization is delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several rare adverse events have been described in case reports but the strength of these associations has not been clear.</p><p>A series of reports on a possible association between hepatitis B vaccination and multiple sclerosis prompted the French Government in October 1998 to suspend routine school-based vaccination for hepatitis B. However, at least six subsequent studies from the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/97-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-102</a>] failed to show a statistically significant temporal or causal association between hepatitis B vaccination and multiple sclerosis. Based upon the current evidence and the proven benefit of the vaccine, the World Health Organization recommended that all countries should continue to have universal infant <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adolescent hepatitis B immunization programs and to immunize adults at risk of hepatitis B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of nonresponders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three main groups of vaccine nonresponders:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with underlying medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease and immunosuppressed states. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, response rate to the standard dose of vaccine is between 50 and 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. This can be improved to above 70 percent by doubling the dose of the vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. The response rate can also be improved by intradermal administration of the vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. However, intradermal injections are technically difficult and inadvertent subcutaneous injections can result in diminished efficacy. The current policy for patients with chronic renal failure is to vaccinate them before commencement of hemodialysis. In the United States, higher doses of vaccine are recommended for patients who are already on hemodialysis or who are immunocompromised. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second group of nonresponders consists of healthy individuals in whom the lack of response appears to be genetically determined. Immunogenetics studies have demonstrated that these individuals lack a dominant response gene that controls the production of anti-HBs. The absence of this gene may be marked by two extended HLA haplotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. In a study from the United States, an increased incidence of individuals homozygous for the extended HLA haplotype -B8, SC01, DR3 was found among nonresponders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Among the responders, individuals homozygous for this haplotype developed a lower antibody level compared to heterozygotes. In another study of 52 nonresponders from Sweden, the HLA haplotype (DQB1*0604; DQA1*0102DRB1*1302) was more frequent in nonresponders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. However, the same HLA haplotypes could be found among responders and nonresponders suggesting that factors other than immunogenetics may be related to nonresponse to hepatitis B vaccine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Individuals with celiac disease also appear to have a diminished response to HBV vaccination, possibly because of HLA haplotypes that predispose to both celiac disease and HepB vaccine nonresponse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third group of nonresponders consists of individuals who failed to respond as a result of technical errors including intra-gluteal injection or inappropriate storage conditions such as inadvertent freezing of vaccines during shipment.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Recommendation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The current recommendation for all healthy individuals who do <strong>not</strong> develop an adequate anti-HBs response to the primary vaccine series is to administer one or more additional doses. An adequate antibody response is seen in 15 to 25 percent after one additional dose and in 50 percent after three additional doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. As a result, it may be reasonable to repeat a three-dose schedule, retesting two to three months after the third dose. Individuals who fail to respond after three additional doses of vaccine that have been appropriately administered are unlikely to benefit from further vaccination. However, these individuals may still mount an adequate immune response and recover from HBV infection. </p><p>Individuals who fail to respond after two courses of HepB vaccine should be tested for HBsAg, particularly in countries where pre-vaccination testing is not performed or performed using anti-HBs test only. Nonresponders who test negative for HBsAg should be educated on how to prevent HBV infection, including the need for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> (HBIG) if they have an exposure to blood or other body fluids of a person who is HBsAg-positive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection among healthcare providers&quot;, section on 'Post-exposure management'</a>.)</p><p>Additional strategies for vaccinating nonresponders continue to be studied. In a report that included 48 HepB vaccine nonresponders, vaccination with a double dose of the combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (Twinrix) at zero, one, and six months led to protective anti-HBs levels in 59 and 95 percent after the first and third dose, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. These results support that nonresponders should receive a second course of HepB vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">VACCINE-INDUCED HBV S ESCAPE MUTANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HBV S gene mutants have been described in infants who were infected with hepatitis B despite an adequate anti-HBs response to hepatitis B vaccination. These mutants have been observed in many parts of the world including China, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Italy, and Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/109-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">109-114</a>]. The most common mutation involves a glycine to arginine substitution at codon 145 in the &quot;a&quot; determinant of HBsAg. This mutation decreases binding of HBsAg to anti-HBs and may explain why these infants develop &quot;escape&quot; infection. The G145R mutation has also been observed in liver transplant recipients who developed recurrent HBV infection despite HBIG prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/115,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">115,116</a>]. Other mutations in the &quot;a&quot; determinant have also been described, but are of unclear significance.</p><p>Most reports found that the HBV S mutations were not detected in the maternal carriers, suggesting that the mutations were selected by immune pressure (vaccine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HBIG). A study from Taiwan demonstrated these mutants in infants who received HepB vaccine without HBIG indicating that the vaccine alone was sufficient to select the mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. These mutants can be detected in less than 5 percent of all infants who have received HBV vaccination and only 10 to 40 percent of the vaccine failures can be attributed to HBV S mutants. Experiments in chimpanzees confirmed that these mutants are infectious.</p><p>There are concerns that the vaccine escape mutants have become more prevalent over time, causing acute infections in individuals who were previously vaccinated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. However, long-term follow-up of vaccination programs have not observed a progressive decline in the efficacy of HepB vaccines. A report from Taiwan found that the prevalence of HBV S mutants in HBV DNA positive children increased from 8 percent (8 of 103) in 1984 to 19.6 percent (10 of 51) in 1989, peaked at 28 percent (9 of 32) in 1994, and remained at 23 percent (3 of 13) in 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. However, long-term follow-up of vaccination programs have not observed a progressive decline in the efficacy of HepB vaccines or an increase in the prevalence of HBV S mutants among the pediatric population. A report from Taiwan found that the prevalence of HBV S mutants among children &lt;15 years surveyed in 1984 and 2004 decreased from 0.67 to 0.10 percent, and prevalence of HBsAg decreased from 9.6 to 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>].</p><p>Based upon available data, the benefits of conventional HepB vaccine far outweigh the concerns of HBV S escape mutants and vaccination programs should not be deterred because of these concerns. However, continued monitoring is necessary to determine if the prevalence of these mutants is increasing and if the protective efficacy of conventional vaccines is maintained. There is clearly a need for further research to develop vaccines that are more effective and which are capable of circumventing these mutations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">VACCINATION FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, hepatitis B vaccination can prevent HBV infection and its complications and is extremely cost-effective (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above). Nevertheless, many countries have not yet implemented universal vaccination. In Europe, as of March 2009, six countries (the United Kingdom, and the five Nordic countries) have not implemented universal vaccination because of the belief that hepatitis B is a limited public health problem that does not justify the expense and other efforts of universal vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. In developing and under-developed nations, health policies concentrate on more pressing needs such as food, clean water supply and sanitation. The high cost of hepatitis B vaccines and the lack of infrastructure to deliver the vaccines further impede the implementation of universal vaccination programs.</p><p>The cost of hepatitis B vaccine has decreased due to economies of scale, local production of vaccines, competition among vaccine manufacturers, and bulk discounts obtained by the World Health Organization permitting many developing countries to initiate hepatitis B vaccine programs. The World Bank's 1993 Development Report stated that the addition of hepatitis B is the most cost-effective intervention in preventive care in developing countries. To further the cause of disease prevention through immunization, the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization (GAVI) was launched in 2000 to harness the strength and experience of multiple partners in immunization. The Vaccine Fund, GAVI's financing arm listed hepatitis B vaccine as one of the vaccines that support may be provided for based on the country's proposal. Since its inception, GAVI has prevented more than 670,000 deaths by improving the delivery of vaccines to children in the poorest countries. Since 1999, the Vaccine Fund has raised more than $2.3 billion. However, WHO estimates that $8 to $12 billion will be needed from 2005 to 2010 to immunize children in the poorest countries, hence the call for donors, both private and public to step up the effort to close the immunization gap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].</p><p>Despite the recognized benefit on public health, children in the poorest countries who depend upon donated vaccines continue to be denied hepatitis vaccine. In these countries, addition of hepatitis B vaccine to other childhood vaccines (such as BCG, DTP, polio, and measles) would double or triple the budget of the donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. With the effort from GAVI, 42 million more children have been vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine from 2001 to 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].</p><p>With the concerted efforts of WHO, GAVI, and other public and private organizations, the coverage for hepatitis B vaccination has improved significantly. As of 2015, 185 member states vaccinate infants against hepatitis B compared with 31 in 1992. In addition, 96 member states have introduced hepatitis B birth dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. Globally, the third dose coverage of the vaccine for infants has reached 84 percent. The coverage is highest in North America and some high prevalent countries in Asia (approximately 90 percent) but decreases to about 47 percent in India where the disease prevalence is high. Although the cost of vaccine continues to decline, the cost of cold chain for storage of vaccine and the infrastructure needed for administration in remote areas continue to be a barrier to global vaccination. </p><p>However, in June 2014, the GAVI Board decided to no longer offer financial support to countries who wished to introduce birth dose of hepatitis B vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. This was related to the high cost of implementation, particularly with births that occur at home. Unfortunately, this strategy exposes infants to possible HBV infection during the first few months of life given the long gap between birth and the first dose of HBV vaccine through Expanded Programme of Immunization. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">NEW DEVELOPMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for multiple dosing, the observation that 5 to 10 percent of vaccinees are nonresponders, and reports of vaccine escape HBV S gene mutants remain a challenge for the production of a better vaccine. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Ways to improve the application of the vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measures that can decrease the cost of manufacturing and delivering vaccines are particularly important in under-developed countries. As an example, administration of hepatitis B vaccine via oral and nasal routes has the potential to increase the coverage of hepatitis B vaccination in regions where facilities for parenteral administration are limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Single-dose vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A single-dose vaccine has been developed in which HBsAg has been encapsulated in microparticles prepared from polylactide-co-glycolide and polylactide polymers. Both small (&lt;10 microns) and large (10 to 100 microns) particles are obtained with 80 percent of the particles encapsulated. Upon inoculation, the combination of small, large, encapsulated, and unencapsulated HBsAg particles are released at different times simulating multiple dosing. In a study in mice, a single injection of this compound vaccine induced comparable anti-HBs titers at one year compared to mice inoculated with three doses of the conventional vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. To date, this vaccine remains to be tested in humans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gene coding for HBsAg has been inserted into a virulent strain of recombinant Salmonella, which can be administered orally. Salmonella produces HBsAg, which is presented to mucosal macrophages leading to the production of anti-HBs. This live vaccine has been successful in inducing an anti-HBs response in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. However, concerns about the virulence of the recombinant Salmonella have slowed the development of this vaccine. More recently, genetically engineered plants such as bananas and potatoes expressing HBsAg have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. One report described successful immunization of mice using an oral recombinant hepatitis B vaccine encapsulated in alginate chitosan nanoparticles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. Another study in mice found comparable outcomes between an oral hepatitis B vaccine using HBsAg particles linked to poly Lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles and an intramuscularly-delivered HBsAg vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Inhaled and intranasal vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled and intranasal vaccines are being developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/130-134\" class=\"abstract_t\">130-134</a>].

An intranasal vaccine showed promise in a phase 1 study in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].

Several studies have evaluated intradermal versus intramuscular vaccination in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis (a group that generally has a suboptimal response to vaccination). A meta-analysis of 12 studies concluded that an initial response was more likely with the intradermal approach but the difference was no longer significant with follow-up (6 to 60 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>].</p><p>In other studies, the increased efficacy of intradermal inoculation was also evident in intramuscular vaccine nonresponders. In one study, for example, 50 hemodialysis patients were revaccinated either intradermally or intramuscularly with a total dose of 80 mcg of recombinant vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>].

Frequent low dose intradermal administration of hepatitis B vaccine may maintain protective anti-HBs levels in hemodialyzed patients who did not have an adequate immune response to hepatitis B vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].

Subsequently, adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccines have been developed. An <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvanted-recombinant-hepatitis-b-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adjuvanted recombinant hepatitis B vaccine</a> (HEPLISAV) consisting of HBsAg with an adjuvant immunostimulatory phosphorothioate oligodeoxyribonucleotide (HBV-ISS) has received conditional approval in the United States for adults 18 years of age and older. (See <a href=\"#H3435692528\" class=\"local\">'Single antigen vaccines'</a> above.)</p><p>Another vaccine combines HBsAg with an adjuvant containing 3'-deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A and alum (AS04) to enhance the immunogenicity. This vaccine is approved in Europe for patients older than 15 years of age with renal insufficiency, including those who are prehemodialysis and those on hemodialysis.</p><p>The use of the <span class=\"nowrap\">HBsAg/AS04</span> vaccine has been supported by several studies. In one study involving 105 individuals aged 20 to 60 years who were nonresponders to commercially available hepatitis B vaccine, <span class=\"nowrap\">HBsAg/AS04</span> vaccine was compared with revaccination with commercially available hepatitis B vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. After three doses, the response rate among those who received the <span class=\"nowrap\">HBsAg/AS04</span> vaccine was 98 percent compared with 68 percent among those who received the conventional vaccine. The geometric mean anti-HBs titers (GMT) were also significantly higher than the group that received conventional vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. In another study, patients undergoing maintenance renal dialysis were vaccinated with four doses of HBV-AS04 vaccine.

All three regions contain immunogenic T and B cell epitopes. Studies in mice found that addition of pre-S1 or pre-S2 regions may circumvent nonresponsiveness to HBsAg. Preliminary clinical studies found that addition of pre-S2 region to conventional vaccine did not reduce the nonresponse rate in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>]. However, a study on 100 nonresponders found that revaccination with a vaccine that contain pre-S1, pre-S2 and S regions induced higher rates of response than revaccination with another course of conventional vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>]. Sixty-nine percent of the vaccinees seroconverted after one single dose of the vaccine and one vaccinee seroconverted after a booster dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>].

Hepatitis B vaccine is effective not only in preventing HBV infection but also in preventing the sequelae of chronic HBV infection. It is the first example that cancer can be prevented by vaccination. Nevertheless, much work remains to achieve the goal of global eradication of HBV infection. Clearly, the costs of vaccines have to be reduced and the infrastructure for their delivery has to be simplified. As with other areas of medicine, new challenges frequently arise as old problems are solved.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">World Health Organization.
