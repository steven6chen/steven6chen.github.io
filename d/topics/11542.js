Between 50 and 90 percent of women with normal pregnancies have some degree of nausea, with or without vomiting. The severity of these symptoms can vary. </p><p>&quot;Morning sickness&quot; is the term often used to describe mild nausea and vomiting that occurs due to pregnancy (and not due to other illness), while &quot;hyperemesis gravidarum&quot; is the term used to describe a more severe condition. Hyperemesis may cause you to vomit multiple times throughout the day, lose weight, and usually requires treatment in the hospital.</p><p>This article discusses treatments available for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. A more detailed article is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and outcome of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MORNING SICKNESS VERSUS HYPEREMESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Morning sickness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nausea and vomiting often develop by five to six weeks of pregnancy. The symptoms are usually worst around nine weeks, and typically improve by 16 to 18 weeks of pregnancy. However, symptoms continue until the third trimester in 15 to 20 percent of women and until delivery in 5 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although mild pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting is often called &quot;morning sickness,&quot; you may feel sick at any time of day, and many women (80 percent) feel sick throughout the day.</p><p>Interestingly, women with mild nausea and vomiting during pregnancy experience fewer miscarriages and stillbirths than women without these symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperemesis gravidarum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperemesis gravidarum is the term used to describe more severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Women with hyperemesis often vomit every day and may lose more than 5 percent of their pre-pregnancy body weight. In most cases, women with hyperemesis gravidarum will have blood and urine tests that show evidence of dehydration. They also may develop vitamin and other nutrient deficiencies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSE OF NAUSEA AND VOMITING IN PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting is not clear. Several theories have been proposed, although none have been definitively proven. Increased hormone levels, slowed movement of the stomach contents, genetic predisposition, and psychological factors are among the more common theories.</p><p>Some women are more likely to develop nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, including women who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developed these symptoms in a previous pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experience nausea and vomiting while taking estrogen (for example, in birth control pills) or have menstrual migraines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experience motion sickness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have family members (especially sisters or mothers) who had these symptoms in pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a history of gastrointestinal problems (ie, reflux, ulcers)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have twins, triplets, or other multiples</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a molar pregnancy (a type of abnormal placenta)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SEEK HELP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women, especially those with mild to moderate nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting, do not need to see a healthcare provider for treatment of nausea and vomiting. The suggestions below may help to reduce symptoms and prevent dehydration. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>Women with more severe nausea and vomiting sometimes need to be evaluated by their primary care or obstetrical provider. Seek help if you have one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of dehydration, including infrequent urination, dark-colored urine, or dizziness with standing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting repeatedly throughout the day, especially if you see blood in the vomit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal or pelvic pain or cramping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unable to keep down any food or drinks for more than 12 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss of more than 5 pounds (2.3 kg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever or diarrhea in addition to nausea and vomiting</p><p/><p>One or more tests may be recommended to investigate the cause and determine the severity of the nausea and vomiting, including blood tests, urine tests, or an ultrasound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF NAUSEA AND VOMITING IN PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting aims to help you feel better and allow you to eat and drink enough so that you do not lose weight or develop deficiencies of essential vitamins and nutrients.</p><p>Treatment may not totally eliminate your nausea and vomiting. You may need to try several types of treatment or a combination of treatments over a period of weeks before finding what works best for you. Fortunately, symptoms generally resolve by mid-pregnancy, even if you do not use any treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and outcome of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nausea and vomiting can be made worse from overeating or excessive hunger. Eating too much, avoiding food altogether, or not eating enough food may actually make nausea worse. Try eating before or as soon as you feel hungry to avoid an empty stomach. Eat snacks frequently and have small meals to keep the stomach from being too full (eg, six small meals a day) that are high in protein or carbohydrates and low in fat. Drink cold, clear, and carbonated or sour fluids (eg, ginger ale, lemonade) and drink these in small amounts between meals. Smelling fresh lemon, mint, or orange or using an oil diffuser with these scents may also be useful. Switching to a different toothpaste may help women for whom strong mint-flavored toothpaste is a trigger. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most important treatments for pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting is to avoid odors, tastes, and other activities that trigger nausea. Eliminating spicy foods helps some women. Other examples of triggers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stuffy rooms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Odors (eg, perfume, chemicals, coffee, food, smoke)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heat and humidity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual or physical motion (eg, flickering lights, driving)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive salivation (ptyalism)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive fatigue or feeling tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods and snacks high in sugar</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spicy foods and high-fat foods</p><p/><p>Brushing teeth after eating may help prevent symptoms. Avoid lying down immediately after eating and avoid quickly changing positions.</p><p>If you take a prenatal vitamin with iron and this worsens your symptoms, try taking it at bedtime. If symptoms persist, stop the vitamins temporarily. Some women may tolerate a chewable prenatal vitamin better than a vitamin in tablet form. If you stop taking your prenatal vitamin, take a supplement that contains 400 to 800 micrograms of folic acid until you are at least 14 weeks pregnant to reduce the risk of birth defects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications that reduce nausea and vomiting are effective in some women and are safe to take during pregnancy. None of the medications discussed below are known to be harmful. Make sure you talk with your healthcare provider before taking any new over the counter or prescription medications, including nutritional and herbal supplements.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin B6 and doxylamine &mdash; Vitamin B6 supplements can reduce symptoms of mild to moderate nausea, but do not usually help with vomiting. Doxylamine is a medication that can reduce vomiting, and may be combined with vitamin B6. Doxylamine is available in the United States in some non-prescription sleep aids (eg, Unisom, Good Sense Sleep Aid) and as a prescription antihistamine chewable tablet (Aldex AN). Combinations of vitamin B6 and doxylamine formulations are available for the initial treatment of nausea (eg, Diclectin in Canada and Diclegis in the United States).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antihistamines and other anti-nausea medications &mdash; Antihistamines and other anti-nausea medications are safe and effective treatments for pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting. The following medications may be recommended:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but this drug may cause drowsiness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Meclizine (Bonine), but this drug may also cause drowsiness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other anti-nausea medications that are available by prescription include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Promethazine (Phenergan) &mdash; Promethazine is available in pill, oral solution, injectable solution, or rectal suppository form. It is usually taken every four hours, and may cause drowsiness and dry mouth. Rare side effects include muscle contractions that cause twisting or jerking movements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Metoclopramide (Reglan) &mdash; Metoclopramide speeds emptying of the stomach and may help to reduce nausea and vomiting. It is available in a pill, oral solution, and injectable usually taken 30 minutes prior to meals and at bedtime. Metoclopramide can also be associated with twisting or jerking movements. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ondansetron (Zofran) &mdash; Ondansetron is an anti-nausea medication that is usually taken by mouth or injection every eight to 12 hours. Ondansetron should not be taken by patients with a condition called prolonged Q-T interval, or with other medications that can prolong the Q-T interval, as this can lead to abnormally and potentially fatal, abnormal heart rhythm. Constipation is a side effect of ondansetron that some patients find bothersome, and which can be treated with a stool softener and mild laxative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prochlorperazine (Compazine) &mdash; Prochlorperazine is available in a pill, rectal suppository, or as an injectable solution. It may cause drowsiness and dry mouth. It can cause jerking motions (similar to promethazine and metoclopramide), and should be avoided in patients prone to Q-T prolongation (similar to ondansetron). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Corticosteroids (Solu-cortef, dexamethasone) &mdash; A short course of steroid injection followed by a taper of pills may be offered to women who do not respond to a combination of the medications listed above. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Subcutaneous medication pump use &mdash; There is very little evidence that supports use of metoclopramide or ondansetron in a subcutaneous, continuous infusion pump. Adverse side effects are common, and use of a subcutaneous pump for treatment of pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting has not proven to be cost effective, even when compared with hospitalization. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluids and nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are unable to hold down food or liquids, you may be treated with intravenous (IV) fluids. This may be done in your doctor or nurse's office or in the hospital, depending upon the severity of your vomiting. For a short time, you may be advised not to eat or drink anything, to allow the gut to rest. You can slowly begin to eat and drink again as you begin to feel better, usually within 24 to 48 hours.</p><p>If you continue to lose weight despite treatment, your doctor may consider other forms of feeding, such as the use of a nasogastric tube (a tube that is inserted through your nose into the stomach) or supplemental nutrition through an IV line.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Complementary treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following treatments may be useful when used with the treatments described above.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acupuncture and acupressure &mdash; Acupressure wristbands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72347\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72347 \">picture 1</a>) and acupuncture have become a popular treatment for nausea and vomiting caused by pregnancy, motion sickness, and other causes. Some studies have not shown these wristbands to be more effective than sham (fake, look-alike) wristbands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], although some women find them helpful. Acupuncture and acupressure have no known harmful side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypnosis &mdash; Hypnosis has been reported to be helpful in some people. Counseling may be helpful for women with anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ginger &mdash; Powdered ginger or ginger tea may help to relieve nausea and vomiting in some women. One small study has shown powdered ginger to be more effective than placebo to reduce symptoms and frequency of nausea and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, further studies are needed to confirm that powdered ginger is safe and effective. Until more data are available, we suggest the use of ginger containing foods (eg, ginger lollipops, ginger ale) for mild nausea and vomiting. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting recover completely without any complications. Women with mild to moderate vomiting often gain less weight during early pregnancy. This is rarely a concern for the baby unless the mother was very underweight before pregnancy (at least 10 percent under the ideal body weight).Most weight gain in pregnancy occurs in the last half of pregnancy, after pregnancy-associated nausea and vomiting has resolved. </p><p>Normal weight gain during pregnancy depends upon your pre-pregnancy height and weight. For women of normal weight (body mass index 18.5 to 24.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kilogram/meter2),</span> the recommended weight gain is between 25 and 35 pounds (11.5 to 16.0 kilograms) for a singleton pregnancy.</p><p>In women with severe nausea and vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum) who are hospitalized multiple times and who do not gain weight normally during pregnancy, there is a small risk that the baby will be underweight or small.</p><p>Women who have hyperemesis gravidarum in one pregnancy are at risk of severe nausea and vomiting in future pregnancies. The risk is between 15 and 20 percent. Women who do not have severe nausea and vomiting in the first pregnancy are less likely to have it in future pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=6734\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
