As a consequence, the diagnosis of abnormal glucocorticoid metabolism can be challenging in this patient population.</p><p>The kidney normally contributes to the excretion of cortisol and its water-soluble metabolites. As a result, the serum half-life of cortisol becomes prolonged in advanced renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Both normal and elevated levels of serum cortisol have been reported in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Methodological problems may in part account for the conflicting results. As an example, compounds (including metabolites of cortisol) accumulate in renal disease that can interfere with the accurate measurement of cortisol by several commercially available assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Cortisol binding to corticosteroid-binding globulin remains normal, while binding to albumin is decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTS OF ADRENAL AND PITUITARY FUNCTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and metyrapone stimulation tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests designed to assess the secretory capacity of the adrenal gland are typically normal. Thus, the diurnal variation in cortisol release is well preserved, and circulating cortisol levels increase appropriately after an infusion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Cortisol levels also increase after the administration of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH); the expected rise in ACTH secretion is blunted in this setting, a response similar to that observed with chronic stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. For reasons that are unclear, the ACTH response to CRH is improved by recombinant human erythropoietin&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Stimulation of ACTH and cortisol secretion following insulin-induced hypoglycemia or the infusion of CRH is impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. ACTH and 11-deoxycortisol responses are also blunted following the standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> test dose (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This defect may be due to adrenal resistance to the blocking action of metyrapone in renal failure since the response can be normalized by the administration of higher doses.</p><p>Interpretation of these abnormalities may be complicated by the effect of hemodialysis on the plasma concentrations of CRH, ACTH, and cortisol. CRH levels fall during hemodialysis due to clearance across the dialysis membrane; despite this change, ACTH and cortisol levels increase in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dexamethasone suppression tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adrenal suppression tests, in comparison, have yielded conflicting results. In three different studies, low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (1 mg given the night before the measurement) produced normal suppression of the serum cortisol concentration; no suppression of cortisol or ACTH; and little or no suppression, but normal suppression of cortisol and ACTH following high-dose (3 mg) dexamethasone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4,5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,10</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that the frequent ineffectiveness of low-dose oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> may at least in part be secondary to decreased drug absorption or altered metabolism in patients with renal failure (see below). Low serum levels of dexamethasone have been noted in those patients who fail to suppress morning serum cortisol levels after administration of 1 mg of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, the administration of higher oral doses (2 to 8 mg) or intravenous dexamethasone failed in one study to normally suppress the serum cortisol concentration despite adequate serum levels of dexamethasone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cortisol as a marker for treatment outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A study of patients on maintenance hemodialysis found that an elevated predialysis serum cortisol concentration was predictive of increased morbidity, as defined by the need for hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, patients with a serum cortisol level above 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/L)</span> were more likely to have signs of malnutrition, such as hypoalbuminemia and decreased triceps skinfold thickness. It is unclear, however, if the high cortisol levels were markers of comorbid illness or were directly responsible for the catabolic state.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS OF EXOGENOUS STEROIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pharmacokinetics of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> are altered in patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cortisol-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is reduced plasma protein binding and increased clearance of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is reduced plasma protein binding but decreased clearance of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>. The fall in clearance may explain the apparently higher incidence of steroid-induced side effects when prednisolone is used in renal failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pharmacokinetics of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> are unaltered.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the aggregate, there does not appear to be an overt abnormality in the function of the hypophyseal-pituitary-adrenal axis intrinsic to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Nevertheless, findings such as spurious overestimation of plasma cortisol, altered cortisol binding to protein, decreased gastrointestinal absorption of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, and abnormal adrenal responses to dexamethasone make the diagnosis of Cushing's disease exceedingly difficult in this setting. One major difference between CKD and Cushing's disease is that the circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion is preserved in the former and lost in the latter. It is not known if subtle abnormalities in glucocorticoid metabolism contribute to some of the findings of the uremic syndrome, such as insulin resistance and negative nitrogen balance.
