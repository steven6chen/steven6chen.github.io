TM can occur as an independent entity, usually as a postinfectious complication, but TM also exists on a continuum of neuro-inflammatory disorders that includes acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, multiple sclerosis, and neuromyelitis optica. The clinical features, diagnostic work-up, and acute and chronic therapies differ between these forms of TM. It is important in the evaluation of patients with acute myelopathies to exclude compressive and noninflammatory causes of myelopathy as well as to distinguish various types of TM, since the prognosis, risk of recurrence, and treatment options may differ among these distinct entities.</p><p>This topic will review transverse myelitis. Related conditions are discussed elsewhere.

There is evidence of perivascular infiltration by monocytes and lymphocytes in the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Axonal degeneration is also reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This pathologic heterogeneity and the involvement of both gray and white matter suggest that TM is not a pure demyelinating disorder but rather a mixed inflammatory disorder that affects neurons, axons, and oligodendrocytes and myelin. Postvaccination TM has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], and autopsy reports have described lymphocytic infiltration with demyelination and axonal loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although these case reports describe TM occurring after vaccination, causation has not been established based on the timing and sequence of events alone. In a US database with 64 million vaccine doses administered among children and adults from 2007 through 2012, there were only seven subjects with TM who were vaccinated during the primary exposure interval of 5 to 28 days prior to TM onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Comparing each TM case with all matched subjects in the exposure interval who received the same vaccination, there was no association of TM with prior vaccination.</p><p>In 30 to 60 percent of the idiopathic TM cases, there is an antecedent respiratory, gastrointestinal, or systemic illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/6-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-12</a>]. In parainfectious TM, the injury may be associated with direct microbial infection of the central nervous system, or with the systemic response to infection by a variety of agents such as varicella zoster virus, herpes virus, and Listeria monocytogenes<em>. </em>Molecular mimicry and super antigen-mediated disease have also been described as potential mechanisms of autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Molecular mimicry in TM was postulated to be the cause of injury following infection with Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) in a patient who had elevated titers of cross-reacting antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Microbial super antigens such as staphylococcal enterotoxins A through I, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, and streptococcus pyogenes exotoxin, have also been purported to stimulate the immune system and are known to be capable of activating T-lymphocytes without costimulatory molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/4,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14-17</a>], thereby triggering autoimmune disease by activating auto-reactive T cell clones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>The diverse pathology of disease-associated TM is evident from studies showing that lupus-associated TM could be associated with central nervous system vasculitis or thrombotic infarction of the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/4,20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20-24</a>]. Other studies have also described the role of autoantibodies in patients with neuromyelitis optica and recurrent TM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. Autoantibodies have been implicated in activating other components of the immune system by crossing the blood-brain barrier. The high prevalence of various autoantibodies seen in such patients suggests polyclonal derangement of the immune system. It may also be that some autoantibodies initiate a direct and selective injury of neurons that express antigens that cross-react with antibodies directed against infectious pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202896339\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic TM usually occurs as a postinfectious complication that appears to result from an autoimmune process.

Idiopathic TM is defined by its occurrence without a definitive etiology despite a thorough work-up. Secondary (disease-associated) TM is most often related to a systemic inflammatory autoimmune condition.</p><p>Subtypes of TM are differentiated on the basis of the clinical severity and radiologic extent of the spinal cord lesion. These include acute partial TM, acute complete TM and longitudinally extensive TM (LETM).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute partial TM refers to spinal cord dysfunction that is mild or grossly asymmetric with an MRI lesion extending one to two vertebral segments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute complete TM refers to spinal cord dysfunction that causes symmetric, complete or near complete neurologic deficits (paresis, sensory loss, and autonomic dysfunction) below the level of the lesion with an MRI lesion extending one to two vertebral segments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) refers to complete or incomplete spinal cord dysfunction with a lesion on MRI that extends three or more vertebral segments.</p><p/><p>These subtypes of TM, while imperfect, imply distinct differential diagnoses and prognoses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689882\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although TM is a rare disorder, the reported incidence between one to eight new cases per million people per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] is probably an underestimate. These numbers would imply that approximately 1400 new cases occur in the United States per year and that about 34,000 people have chronic morbidity from TM at any time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. There is no gender or familial predisposition to TM, although women predominate among the cases that are associated with multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A bimodal peak between the ages of 10 to 19 years and 30 to 39 years has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Approximately 20 percent of cases are under the age of 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. One report found a bimodal distribution by age even among patients younger than 18 years of age, and a higher peak under the age of 3, with no gender predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In the 30 days prior to the onset of TM symptoms, there was a preceding illness in 47 percent of the children and vaccination in 28 percent. There were no patterns in the illness or vaccine history that correlated with the acute onset of disease.</p><p>In one series of 354 patients with TM, approximately 64 percent of cases were idiopathic and 36 percent were disease-associated (secondary TM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In other reports, idiopathic TM accounts for 15 to 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/39,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,43,44</a>]. These wide discrepancies in the frequency of idiopathic TM may reflect variation in catchment area populations, disease definitions, and the evolution of diagnostic methods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190496510\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of TM is characterized by acute or subacute development of neurologic signs and symptoms consistent with motor, sensory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autonomic dysfunction. Motor symptoms include a rapidly progressing paraparesis that can involve the upper extremities, with initial flaccidity followed by spasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/1,4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,10</a>]. Most patients have a sensory level. In one series of 170 patients with idiopathic TM, spinal MRI T2-weighted imaging showed a cervical signal abnormality in 44 percent and a thoracic signal abnormality in 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A thoracic clinical sensory level was identified in 63 percent of the patients. Typical sensory symptoms are pain, dysesthesia, and paresthesia, although paresthesia are uncommon in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/1,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,46</a>]. Autonomic symptoms include increased urinary urgency, bladder and bowel incontinence, difficulty or inability to void, incomplete evacuation and bowel constipation, and sexual dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/1,47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,47-49</a>]. The onset of urinary retention may be the first sign of myelitis and should always raise the possibility of a myelopathy.</p><p>In a series of 47 children with TM, the mean time to nadir from the onset of acute symptoms was about two days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Common symptoms included sensory loss or numbness, weakness, urinary dysfunction, and pain, as reported in 91, 89, 85, and 75 percent of children, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Most (89 percent) of the children were bed bound or wheelchair bound in the initial phase of TM. Also noted was the high proportion of children (53 percent) that had a thoracic clinical sensory level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>In an adult case series of 170 patients with idiopathic TM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], the rostral-caudal extent of the lesion ranged from one vertebral segment in many to the entire spinal cord in two patients. A similar pattern was seen in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], with the average lesion spanning six segments.</p><p>MRI of the spinal cord typically shows a gadolinium-enhancing signal abnormality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73197\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73197 \">image 1</a>), usually extending over one or more cord segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/6,42,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,42,50,51</a>]. The cord often appears swollen at the affected levels.</p><p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is abnormal in approximately one-half of patients, with a moderate lymphocytosis (typically <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> and an elevated protein level (usually 100 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. Glucose levels are normal. Oligoclonal bands are usually not present in isolated TM, and when present suggest a higher risk of subsequent MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/6,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,52</a>]. In a case series of 170 adult patients with idiopathic TM, the mean CSF white blood cell count was <span class=\"nowrap\">38/mm<sup>3</sup></span> and mean protein level was 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, higher levels were observed in a pediatric case series, where the mean white cell count was <span class=\"nowrap\">136/mm<sup>3</sup></span> and the mean protein level was 173 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.73 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689889\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of TM is suspected when there are acute or subacute signs and symptoms of motor, sensory, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autonomic dysfunction that localize to one or more contiguous spinal cord segments in patients with no evidence of a compressive cord lesion.

The first step is to determine from the history and examination (see <a href=\"#H190496510\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above) whether the condition is likely to be a myelopathy.</p><p>When myelopathy is suspected, emergent spinal imaging is warranted to exclude a compressive etiology.

Clinicians should remember that conditions that cause systemic inflammation can present with TM as an initial event.</p><p>The importance of defining whether the TM is idiopathic or disease-associated is that the prognosis, acute and chronic treatments, and risks of recurrence are different between those groups. As an example, TM associated with active systemic lupus erythematosus could be associated with antiphospholipid antibodies or active vasculitic lupus, requiring treatment with anticoagulation or immunosuppressive therapy, respectively.</p><p>Clinical and imaging evidence of multifocal involvement within the central nervous system raise suspicion for TM associated with multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65585 \">table 2</a>). Neuromyelitis optica involves primarily, though not exclusively, the optic nerve and the spinal cord; patients with neuromyelitis optica typically have longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167018386\"><span class=\"h2\">Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome) may also present with progressive sensory and motor dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, several clinical and paraclinical features may be used to rapidly discriminate patients with AIDP from those with acute myelopathies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F88912\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88912 \">table 5</a>). First, patients with AIDP often have both upper and lower extremity involvement, though the lower extremity involvement is usually more severe. By contrast, patients with myelopathy may have only lower extremity involvement if the myelopathy is thoracic, or equivalent upper and lower extremity involvement if the myelopathy is cervical. Similarly, autonomic involvement differs between patients with AIDP and myelopathy. Patients with myelopathy are more likely to have urinary or bowel urgency or retention, while those with AIDP are more likely to have cardiovascular instability. Every attempt should be made to determine a neuropathic versus myelopathic pattern of sensory loss, since a sensory level is often definable in patients with acute myelopathy but is never present in AIDP. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis in AIDP usually shows an elevated protein with few white cells (ie, cyto-albuminologic dissociation) whereas patients with TM may have an inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid with an elevated number of white blood cells and IgG index. Spinal MRI imaging often shows a discrete lesion in myelopathy, whereas spinal MRI is normal in AIDP. Finally, electrodiagnostic studies may show conduction block or slowed conduction of peripheral nerves in AIDP and are usually (though not always) normal in myelopathies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689924\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous glucocorticoids have long been considered the standard of care and first-line therapy in acute idiopathic TM. Even without placebo-controlled trials evaluating glucocorticoids specifically in TM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], there is good evidence that intravenous glucocorticoids are effective in acute inflammatory central nervous system diseases like TM, such as multiple sclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p>Therefore, we suggest high-dose intravenous glucocorticoid treatment for adult and adolescent patients with acute idiopathic TM. Our preferred regimens are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (1000 mg daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (200 mg daily) for three to five days. Continued treatment with glucocorticoids or more aggressive regimens is based upon the clinical course and radiologic parameters.</p><p>Plasma exchange may be effective for acute central nervous system demyelinating diseases that fail to respond to high-dose glucocorticoid treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. Thus, in addition to high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, we suggest treatment with plasma exchange for patients who have acute TM with motor impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Our preferred regimen is five treatments, each with exchanges of 1.1 to 1.5 plasma volumes, every other day for 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. For patients with significant deficits, waiting until glucocorticoid treatments are completed is not necessary. Clinical judgment must be used and some patients may benefit from earlier intervention with plasma exchange.</p><p>In the clinical experience of the authors, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (800 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> administered as a single pulse dose) for patients with aggressive TM has been associated with good outcomes. In a retrospective study, all 122 patients with idiopathic TM were treated with three to five days of intravenous methylprednisone, either alone (n = 66) or in combination with plasma exchange (n = 32), cyclophosphamide (n = 13), or both plasma exchange and cyclophosphamide (n = 11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In a subset of patients with systemic autoimmune disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus), the addition of cyclophosphamide to the treatment regimen improved outcomes. In the absence of systemic autoimmune disease, plasma exchange plus methylprednisone was superior to methylprednisone alone. Given the methodologic limitations of this small, uncontrolled observational study, these findings require confirmation in randomized controlled trials.</p><p>For patients with recurrent disease, chronic immunomodulatory therapy must be considered. We most commonly treat patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (150 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/daily),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week)</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> (2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">gm/daily),</span> though oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day) may also be used in patients with systemic inflammatory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Ultimately, it may be possible both to specifically and effectively modulate the inflammation causing TM and to provide neuroprotection against the immune-mediated assault that occurs with TM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201252335\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with idiopathic TM have at least a partial recovery, which usually begins within one to three months, and continues with exercise and rehabilitation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-myelitis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Secondary (disease-associated) TM is most often related to a systemic inflammatory autoimmune condition. Idiopathic TM usually occurs as a postinfectious complication and presumably results from an autoimmune process. Alternatively, TM can be associated with infectious, systemic inflammatory, or multifocal central nervous system disease. Acquired central nervous system demyelinating disorders that can cause TM include multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. (See <a href=\"#H202896339\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H201252316\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TM is rare, with an annual incidence of one to eight new cases per million.

Motor symptoms include a rapidly progressing paraparesis that can involve the upper extremities, with initial flaccidity followed by spasticity. In most patients, a sensory level can be identified. Sensory symptoms include pain, dysesthesia and paresthesia. Autonomic symptoms involve increased urinary urgency, bladder and bowel incontinence, difficulty or inability to void, incomplete evacuation and bowel constipation, and sexual dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H190496510\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of TM is suspected when there are acute or subacute signs and symptoms of motor, sensory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autonomic dysfunction that localize to one or more contiguous spinal cord segments in patients with no evidence of a compressive cord lesion. Thus, the diagnosis of TM requires exclusion of a compressive cord lesion, usually by MRI, and confirmation of inflammation by either gadolinium-enhanced MRI or lumbar puncture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F88920\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88920 \">algorithm 1</a>).
