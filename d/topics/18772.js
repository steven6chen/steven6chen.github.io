They usually occur during pregnancy and typically regress spontaneously within six weeks postpartum. They are rare in nulliparous women. When they occur in non-pregnant women, they generally present in the second or third decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis/pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar varicosities are dilated venous channels that probably develop from a combination of proximal venous obstruction and valvular incompetence, which results in increased venous pressure. Their anatomy has been defined by direct injection and surgical dissection of the varices.</p><p>The vascular drainage of the female external genitalia includes the dorsal superficial clitoral, bulbovestibular, profundus clitoral, and posterior labial veins. Because these perineal veins do not have valves, they are susceptible to the development of varices. Up to one-half of vulvar varicosities arise from an incompetent great saphenous vein, which drains the superficial and deep external pudendal veins and posteromedial tributaries. </p><p>Insufficiency of the internal iliac and ovarian veins may also contribute to development of varicose veins over the territories of their main tributaries (ie, the internal pudendal and obturator veins). Such varices can be large, have frequent anastomoses, and involve the vulva and posteromedial aspect of the thigh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Rarely, vulvar varices arise from the round ligament vein, mimicking varicocele in the male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p>Vulvar varicosities are most common in pregnant women because anatomic and physiologic changes associated with pregnancy result in pelvic venous congestion. Proposed mechanisms include (1) increased pelvic blood flow, which impairs venous return via the femoral veins and thus contributes to venous congestion in the lower limbs and pelvis, and (2) mechanical compression of the inferior vena <span class=\"nowrap\">cava/iliac</span> veins by the gravid uterus, which increases venous pressure distally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/6,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8-10</a>]. In addition, hormonal changes likely contribute by causing vasodilation.</p><p>Vulvar varices in nulliparous women are also caused by local venous insufficiency and incompetence; genetic factors likely play a role in predisposition to these venous changes. Rarely, vulvar varicosities can result from pelvic tumors that limit venous drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with vulvar varices are often asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Symptomatic women may describe vulvar discomfort, swelling, and pressure that are exacerbated by prolonged standing, exercise, and coitus. In nonpregnant women, symptoms may be aggravated by menses and may represent a manifestation of PCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/1,3,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,12-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of vulvar varicosities is based on physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F86312\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86312 \">picture 1</a>). Patients should be examined in both the supine and upright positions, since the latter enhances filling of the veins. The varicosities appear as purple-blue distensible folds in the vaginal mucosa and labia or as a grape-like cluster of veins (&quot;bag of worms&quot;) in the enlarged vulva (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76766\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76766 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/8,9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,16</a>]. They may be isolated or associated with varices of the buttocks, thigh, or lower leg.</p><p>There is no consensus on indications for imaging. Imaging is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis, which is evident on physical examination, but may be useful in therapeutic planning. For example, if surgery is planned for treatment of the varicosities, most vascular surgeons would obtain duplex ultrasound studies of the lower extremity veins (even in the absence of lower leg varicosities) to determine whether connections to the saphenous system are present, as these connections would alter the treatment approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of lower extremity chronic venous insufficiency&quot;, section on 'Duplex ultrasonography'</a>.)</p><p>Some clinicians perform magnetic resonance (MR) imaging or computed tomography (CT) to evaluate pelvic and gonadal veins in all patients with vulvar varicosities, and, if imaging is positive, they perform venography if an intervention such as coil embolization is planned.</p><p>Others perform pelvic venography in all patients prior to any invasive therapy since vulvar varicosities caused by incompetence of ovarian veins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> internal iliac veins may recur after local therapy, thus this information may change the primary or secondary treatment approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/1,3,4,6,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4,6,17-19</a>]. As an example, in a series of 25 women with vulvar varices (with and without PCS) who underwent transjugular venography, 15 women (60 percent) had left ovarian vein reflux and thus underwent coil embolization rather than local therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Theoretically, a laceration of large vulvovaginal varicosities could result in significant hemorrhage, but no such hemorrhages have been reported in the literature.

Conservative treatment with oral analgesics is usually effective but, local excision of the thrombus may be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Based on expert opinion, sclerotherapy is the preferred treatment for isolated vulvar varicosities with no evidence of great or small saphenous vein obstruction or reflux on lower extremity duplex ultrasonography. More commonly, there is evidence of saphenous venous insufficiency with duplex ultrasound and evidence of direct communication from the saphenofemoral junction to the vulvar varicosities. In these cases, the leg veins are generally treated first and the treatment response of the vulvar varices is assessed. Local sclerotherapy can be utilized as adjunctive therapy for vulvar varices, if necessary.

The pain varies in severity, but is usually described as a dull ache or heaviness that increases premenstrually; with prolonged standing, postural changes, walking, or activities that increase intraabdominal pressure; and after intercourse (postcoital ache). It is usually unilateral, but can be bilateral or shift from one side to the other. The patient may also complain of sharp exacerbations of pain, dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, and urinary urgency. Gluteal, vulvar, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thigh varices may also be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination PCS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient with characteristic symptoms, the diagnosis is supported by bimanual examination showing marked ovarian tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, and uterine tenderness with direct palpation. In an observational study including 57 women with pelvic pain, the combination of tenderness on abdominal examination over the adnexa and history of postcoital ache was 94 percent sensitive and 77 percent specific for discriminating PCS from other pelvic pathologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/13,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging PCS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging is performed to document the characteristic pelvic venous changes, which support the diagnosis. Although the absence of pelvic venous changes helps to exclude PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as incompetent and dilated ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. In one study, they were seen on computed tomography in 47 percent of asymptomatic multiparous women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In another study, 10 percent of 273 healthy female kidney donors who underwent preoperative abdominal aortography before left nephrectomy had retrograde flow in an incompetent left ovarian vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. About 40 percent of the women with ovarian varices did not have PCS symptoms.</p><p>In addition, although dilatation of the ovarian vein is necessary but not sufficient for diagnosis, there is no consensus on the optimum cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H731753452\"><span class=\"h4\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used, in part, to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilated pelvic veins in the adnexal regions or in the outer one-third of the myometrium (ie, arcuate veins) are common findings on pelvic sonograms.&nbsp;Dilated arcuate veins have no clinical significance, unless associated with other dilated pelvic veins in women with chronic pelvic pain.&nbsp;Focal dilation of these veins could be due to prior instrumentation, trauma, or complications of pregnancy.</p><p>If PCS is suspected, the ovarian veins should be examined as part of the examination. The diagnosis is supported by visualization of dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow, presence of tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F86201\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86201 \">image 1</a>), dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium, and variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva's maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/1,12,13,29,36,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,13,29,36,50,51</a>]. In one study, the mean diameters of the left ovarian vein in 32 patients with presumed PCS and 32 control subjects were 7.9 and 4.9 mm, respectively; the difference was statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Ultrasound may not detect venous changes in affected women because imaging is generally performed with the patient in the supine position when the veins are flaccid. Sensitivity is higher if the study is performed with the patient in the upright position or by asking her to Valsalva. Despite these maneuvers, there is still a poor correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H731753466\"><span class=\"h4\">Venography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many investigators recommend selective ovarian and internal iliac venography in patients with symptoms consistent with PCS, with or without vulvar varicosities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/1,3,4,6,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4,6,17-19</a>]. The procedure involves catheterization of the right and left ovarian veins via a percutaneous femoral or jugular approach. Ovarian venograms in patients with PCS usually demonstrate abnormally dilated ovarian veins (&gt;10 mm in diameter), sluggish blood flow, reflux causing retrograde fill and congestion of the ovarian venous plexus, tortuosity of venous plexuses, uterine venous engorgement, and filling of pelvic veins across the midline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73402\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73402 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/1,4,12,17,32,34,36,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,12,17,32,34,36,51,52</a>].</p><p>Venous reflux often occurs into the thigh with upright positioning and Valsalva. There also may be evidence of internal iliac vein dilatation and reflux. Depending on the population studied, as many as 80 percent of premenopausal women undergoing venography have pelvic varicosities and venous stasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/12,33,35,36,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,33,35,36,48</a>]. Some of these women are asymptomatic, while others have chronic pelvic pain with no other identifiable etiology for their symptoms.</p><p>Venography is probably more sensitive than ultrasonography since it can be performed in the upright or semi-upright position with a tilting table. The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the American Venous Forum (AVF) clinical practice guidelines recommend retrograde ovarian and internal iliac venography as the test of choice for the diagnosis of pelvic venous disorders. In addition to making the diagnosis, it provides an opportunity for concurrent therapeutic transcatheter embolization or sclerotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvovaginal-varicosities-and-pelvic-congestion-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Laparoscopy is less sensitive than venography for diagnosis of venous congestion. Venographic studies in women following normal laparoscopy for chronic pelvic pain have demonstrated dilatation of the major pelvic veins and congestion in the ovarian plexuses and broad ligaments in more than 80 percent. As with pelvic ultrasonography, diagnostic laparoscopy is generally utilized to exclude other causes of chronic pelvic pain.

They are caused by venous obstruction, increased pressure, and venous insufficiency and generally appear during pregnancy and regress postpartum. Hormonal and anatomic factors play a role in pathogenesis. They can arise in isolation, in association with <span class=\"nowrap\">leg/buttock</span> varices, or as part of pelvic congestion syndrome.

Patients should be examined in the supine as well as upright position, which enhances filling of the veins. There is no consensus on indications for imaging. Some clinicians perform magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography to evaluate pelvic and gonadal veins in all patients with vulvar varicosities and, if imaging is positive, they perform venography if an intervention such as coil embolization is planned.
