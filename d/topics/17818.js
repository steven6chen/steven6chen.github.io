As a result, patients with MDS are at risk for symptomatic anemia, infection, and bleeding, as well as progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is often refractory to treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with MDS, particularly those with lower risk MDS, die because of the consequences of bone marrow failure rather than transformation to AML. Thus, use of terms such as &quot;pre-leukemia&quot; or &quot;smoldering leukemia&quot; can be misleading if taken to imply that death or morbidity from MDS results only when AML develops. Indeed, the distinction between MDS and AML is itself arbitrary, as patients with 20 to 30 percent blasts are considered to have MDS by French-American-British (FAB) criteria, but AML by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. </p><p>For many years, transfusion with packed red blood cells and platelets, and the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents were the only available therapies. Subsequently, chemotherapy agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>), and immunosuppressive therapy (eg, antithymocyte globulin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>) were shown to be effective in subsets of patients with MDS. However, due to the advanced age of most patients, the chronicity of the disease, and its attendant morbidities, supportive care remains a central component of the management of all patients with MDS. Patients should be treated as needed with antibiotics for infection and with platelet transfusions for bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the complications of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no consensus regarding a standard treatment approach for patients with symptomatic MDS, and patients should be encouraged to enroll on clinical trials whenever available.

Asymptomatic patients may be followed expectantly with serial examinations and laboratory studies; immunizations should be updated and smoking ceased. Immediate treatment is indicated for patients with symptomatic cytopenias (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia with recurrent infections).

However, despite the increased availability of treatment guidelines, it is important to individualize care for the patient with MDS.</p><p>Treatment options for patients with MDS typically fall into one of three categories: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive care includes the use of antibiotics for infection and red cell and platelet transfusions in the setting of symptomatic anemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Prophylactic antibiotics are generally not helpful and this strategy may select for antibiotic resistance. Supportive care is an important adjunct to the management of all patients with MDS and can be considered as the sole treatment modality for a subset of asymptomatic patients with lower risk MDS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the complications of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low intensity therapies include hematopoietic growth factors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>, immunosuppressive therapy, and low intensity chemotherapy. These can be administered in the outpatient setting and have a low risk of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Low intensity treatments can improve symptoms and quality of life, but are not curative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High intensity therapies include combination chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). They require hospitalization and entail significant risk of treatment-related mortality. However, these treatments may improve blood counts more quickly than less intensive therapy, and although usually not curative they may lengthen survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>High intensity therapies are generally reserved for patients with high or very high IPSS-R scores. This allows for the avoidance of treatment-related morbidity and mortality in most patients with a relatively good prognosis, and allows for the aggressive treatment of disease in those with a poor prognosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519324\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a very low (&le;1.5 points) or low (&gt;1.5 to 3 points) IPSS-R score are primarily treated with supportive care, with or without the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>. This treatment approach may also be considered for patients with a WHO Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) score of very low, low, or intermediate risk or an original IPSS score of low or intermediate-1 risk. Patients with an intermediate-risk IPSS-R score may be treated with this approach or with those used for higher risk MDS. (See <a href=\"#H17341115\" class=\"local\">'Intermediate-risk IPSS-R'</a> below.) </p><p>Patients with a very low or low IPSS-R score have a low rate of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a median overall survival of greater than five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intermediate-low-or-very-low-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The main goals of therapy are to control symptoms due to cytopenias, improve quality of life, and minimize the toxicity of therapy. More intensive therapies (eg, hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT], induction therapy such as that used for AML) are generally avoided because this group has a relatively good expected median survival and a relatively low rate of transformation to AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intermediate-low-or-very-low-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Allogeneic HCT is the only treatment with the potential to cure MDS. Although there is a significant chance of cure after allogeneic HCT in low- and intermediate-risk patients (approximately 60 and 40 percent, respectively), transplant-related mortality and the relapse rate at five years are as high as 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intermediate-low-or-very-low-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

Since these drugs have not been directly compared, the choice should take into consideration the expected toxicities, comorbidities (eg, neuropathy), cost, and convenience of administration (eg, oral versus parenteral). In general, at least four months of azacitidine or decitabine should be administered before concluding a lack of efficacy, whereas earlier responses may be seen with lenalidomide (eg, six weeks).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with symptomatic thrombocytopenia or symptomatic neutropenia, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a>.

Both azacitidine and decitabine have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with MDS.

Treatment with these agents significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.85) and the combined endpoint of time to transformation to AML or death (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.58-0.82). However, given the generally poor prognosis of patients with MDS, the absolute improvement in survival is small. In a subgroup analysis by drug type, these benefits were seen for azacitidine, but not for decitabine. However, the data were not obtained in a randomized trial, and it is plausible that patients chosen to receive azacitidine or decitabine had inherently different prognoses despite similar IPSS scores, given the considerable heterogeneity in survival within low and intermediate-1 IPSS categories.</p><p>A phase II study randomly assigned 113 patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS or <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/myeloproliferative</span> neoplasm (MPN) to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a> (73 patients) versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a> (40 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intermediate-low-or-very-low-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

A concern with this study is that patients received lower than the approved doses of both decitabine (three days rather than five) and azacitidine (three days instead of seven); as a result, it is unclear whether the results may reflect effects of drug dosing rather than efficacy of the specific agent.
