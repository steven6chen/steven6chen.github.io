Vomiting is when you actually throw up. These 2 symptoms can happen together. But sometimes people feel nauseous without throwing up, and some people throw up without feeling nauseous first.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30481854\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes nausea and vomiting?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Food poisoning</strong> &ndash; This can happen if you eat food that has gone bad. It is basically an infection in your stomach. Infections like these often also cause diarrhea. Other kinds of infections that affect the stomach or intestines can also cause nausea and vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dizziness or motion sickness</strong> &ndash; This can happen if you're on a boat or in a car, or something else that moves. It can also happen if there's something wrong inside your ears that affects your balance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines</strong> &ndash; Lots of different medicines can cause nausea or vomiting. Some examples are antidepressants, antibiotics, vitamins, birth control pills, and pain medicines. People who are on chemotherapy for cancer treatment or who have been under anesthesia also often have nausea or vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> &ndash; Many women who are pregnant have nausea or vomiting. People sometimes call this &quot;morning sickness,&quot; but it can happen at any time of day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</strong> &ndash; GERD is condition that causes the juices that are in the stomach to leak back up into the esophagus, the tube that connects the throat to the stomach. It can sometimes cause nausea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Problems with the stomach or intestines</strong> &ndash; In some people, the stomach or intestines do not move food along the way that they are supposed to. In others, the intestines can get blocked. Both of these problems can cause nausea or vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Migraine headaches</strong> &ndash; Some people who get migraine headaches have nausea during their headaches.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alcohol</strong> &ndash; Drinking too much alcohol can cause nausea and vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30481861\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if your symptoms last longer than a day or 2, or you have severe symptoms. You should also call if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have chest or belly pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throw up blood or something that looks like coffee grounds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a bowel movement with blood, or a bowel movement that is black and looks like tar</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever higher than 101&ordm;F</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a severe headache or stiff neck</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel very tired or have trouble getting up</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Show signs of dehydration (meaning that your body has lost too much water). Signs of dehydration include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Being very thirsty or having a dry mouth or tongue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Muscle cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urine that is dark yellow, or not needing to urinate for more than 5 hours</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30481868\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink lots of fluids, if possible</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try eating, but start with foods that have a lot of fluid in them. Good examples are soup, Jell-O, and popsicles. If you do OK with those foods, you can try soft, bland foods, such as plain yogurt. Foods that are high in carbohydrates (&quot;carbs&quot;), like bread or saltine crackers, can help settle your stomach. Some people also find that ginger helps with nausea. You should avoid foods that have a lot of fat in them. They can make nausea worse. Call your doctor if your symptoms come back when you try to eat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid strong smells, such as the smell of perfume</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicines with meals, if possible. But check the bottle first, because some medicines must be taken on an empty stomach.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30481875\"><span class=\"h1\">How are nausea and vomiting treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have been vomiting a lot for more than a day, your doctor or nurse will ask you lots of questions to try to find out what might be causing your symptoms. He or she might also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you fluids through a thin tube that goes in a vein, called an &quot;IV&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you medicines that control nausea and vomiting.
