In some cases, it can cause severe trouble breathing. The virus, sometimes called &quot;EV-D68,&quot; tends to affect children, not adults.</p><p>Small numbers of EV-D68 infections have happened in the United States for many years. In 2014, there was an outbreak of EV-D68. During this outbreak, there were many more cases than usual in the United States, some of them serious.</p><p>When there is no outbreak going on, people who get sick with cold-like symptoms are not likely to have EV-D68.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18543759\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of EV-D68?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with EV-D68 can have regular cold symptoms, like a runny nose, fever, or cough. But they can also have trouble breathing. They might feel like they can't get enough air, or like they have to work harder than usual to breathe. They might also have wheezing (noisy breathing). Children who already have asthma might be more likely to have serious breathing problems if they get infected with EV-D68.</p><p>In rare cases, children with EV-D68 can have serious problems with their muscles. The muscles can become weak, or stop working (called &quot;paralysis&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18543772\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your child is having trouble breathing, or if you think he or she might have EV-D68, call his or her doctor or nurse. The doctor or nurse can tell you if you should go to the emergency department.</p><p>You should also call a doctor or nurse right away if your child refuses to drink anything for a long time, acts confused or extremely tired, or stops responding to you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18543785\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for EV-D68?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There is a test for the EV-D68 virus. But most hospitals are not able to run the test themselves. Instead, they have to send samples (of mucus or saliva) to government-run labs for testing. As a result, it might take a little while to know for sure what the results are.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18543798\"><span class=\"h1\">How is EV-D68 treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Usually, EV-D68 is treated like a regular cold, and goes away on its own. There is no specific medicine used to treat it, and antibiotics do not help. In serious cases where the child is having trouble breathing, he or she might need treatment in the hospital. This can include giving the child extra oxygen, or using machines to help him or her to breathe.</p><p>If your child has mild cold symptoms, keep him or her comfortable. Children who are in pain can take nonprescription pain medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin). Never give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> to a child younger than 18 years. In children, aspirin can cause a serious problem called Reye syndrome.</p><p>If your child is younger than 6 years, do <strong>not</strong> give him or her any cold medicines. These medicines are not safe for young children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18543811\"><span class=\"h1\">Can EV-D68 be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can do the following to help prevent the spread of this infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure your child washes his or her hands often with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your home clean and disinfect tabletops, toys, and other things that a child might touch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you think your child might have EV-D68 or another contagious illness, keep him or her away from other people. Teach your child to cover his or her sneezes and coughs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid touching people who are sick, and do not share cups or eating utensils.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your child has asthma, follow his or her doctor's instructions carefully. Be sure to give your child all the medicines the doctor prescribes. Children with asthma might be more likely to have breathing problems if they get infected with EV-D68.</p><p/><p>There is no vaccine to prevent enterovirus D68.</p><p>For more information about EV-D68, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website at: <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/ev-d68.html&amp;token=L3ay1+ys5VFfPuqNQdLV2ky+tpfe6KbZ3B+ygNrpW4KJygLH6+RAsLgxQxT5LWjjUI3ijv4BhFUbo/mmcMEKXq8AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=96986\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/EV-D68.html</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18543824\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-asthma-triggers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Avoiding asthma triggers (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
