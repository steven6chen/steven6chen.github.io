One retrospective series reported that among 899 patients with PE, approximately 1 percent developed CTEPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast, two prospective series reported that between 3.8 and 4.8 percent of patients developed CTEPH in a two-year period following the diagnosis of PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Another review of 16 studies suggested a prevalence of 0.5 percent in the general population that increases to 3 percent in survivors of PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].The development of CTEPH after two years is rare.</p><p>It is thought that CTEPH may represent the final manifestation of unresolved pulmonary embolism. With improved understanding of CTEPH, a population of patients has been identified with post-embolic exercise intolerance in the absence of resting pulmonary hypertension. This condition has variably been referred to as &quot;chronic thromboembolic disease (CTED)&quot; or &quot;post-PE syndrome.&quot; Exercise intolerance may be due to increased dead space ventilation related to pulmonary vascular obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limitation of maximal cardiac output with exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A lower threshold to look for CTEPH in this population is appropriate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is unknown why some patients with acute pulmonary embolism develop chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and others do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Several studies suggest that an underlying hypercoagulable state may be responsible in some patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor VIII: An observational study that included 122 patients with CTEPH and 82 healthy controls found that elevated levels of factor VIII (defined as &gt;230 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/dL)</span> were more common among patients with CTEPH than controls (41 versus 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The levels remained elevated after thromboendarterectomy. These findings were supported by a larger observational study that followed 360 patients with venous thromboembolism for a mean of 30 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>However, not all abnormalities associated with a hypercoagulable state have been associated with CTEPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activated protein C resistance seems to occur with similar frequency among patients with CTEPH and the general population</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less than 1 percent of patients with CTEPH have deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No defect in fibrinolytic activity has been consistently identified</p><p/><p>Alternative hypotheses also exist. One hypothesis postulates that patients who develop CTEPH represent those few patients with pulmonary emboli whose endogenous fibrinolytic mechanisms are overcome by the age, extent, or location of the obstructing embolus. Another hypothesis proposes that patients with CTEPH have fibrin variants that are resistant to plasmin-mediated lysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A final hypothesis suggests that pulmonary arteriopathy or in situ thrombosis may underlie many cases of this syndrome, instead of thromboembolic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This is based upon the recognition that animal models of CTEPH are difficult to produce by repeatedly embolizing thrombotic material and that most hypercoagulable states do not appear to confer risk for CTEPH. Most clinicians experienced in the management of CTEPH disagree with this hypothesis, instead favoring a thromboembolic basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21</a>].</p><p>Predictors for the development of CTEPH following acute pulmonary embolism (PE) are unknown. In one retrospective study, unprovoked PE, a diagnostic delay more than two weeks, right ventricular dysfunction, diabetes, and hypothyroidism were found to be independent predictors of CTEPH. None of the patients subject to reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy) were diagnosed with CTEPH. Neither did any of the patients ultimately diagnosed with CTEPH have evidence of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, in another study, approximately 3 percent of survivors developed CTEPH despite thrombolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Larger studies are required before these factors can be considered as reliable predictors of CTEPH development such that patients with PE should be followed clinically only. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9358410\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) usually present with progressive dyspnea and exercise intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Occasionally, a patient will have waited to seek medical attention despite these symptoms and will report additional symptoms and signs related to right ventricular dysfunction, such as peripheral edema, exertional chest pain, syncope, or near-syncope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with CTEPH have dyspnea. The dyspnea initially occurs during exertion only, but then progresses to occur at rest and becomes more severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Dyspnea and exercise intolerance are usually more troubling to patients who are active and, therefore, such patients tend to be evaluated earlier than patients who live a sedentary lifestyle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with dyspnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many patients provide a history consistent with an acute venous thromboembolic event (eg, pleuritic chest pain, lower extremity discomfort, or a prolonged atypical pneumonia) months to years prior to the onset of the dyspnea, although a documented history of venous thromboembolism may be absent in as many as 38 percent of patients with surgically-accessible CTEPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Alternatively, they may describe a hospitalization or surgical procedure from which they never fully recovered. The absence of a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism is not surprising since acute venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are frequently overlooked in the population at large [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The absence of a documented history of acute venous thromboembolism should not dissuade a clinician from considering the diagnosis of CTEPH in patients with unexplained dyspnea.</p><p>As the CTEPH progresses, patients may begin to report symptoms or signs related to progressive pulmonary hypertension complicated by right ventricular dysfunction. This may include lower extremity edema, exertional chest pain, near-syncope, or syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings on physical examination may be subtle early in the course of CTEPH. As an example, the only abnormalities may be narrowing of the aortic-pulmonic splitting of the second heart sound or subtle accentuation of the pulmonic component. </p><p>More obvious physical findings become apparent once significant right ventricular hypertrophy or overt right ventricular failure develops. Findings include a right ventricular lift, jugular venous distension, prominent A and V wave venous pulsations, fixed splitting of the second heart sound, a right ventricular S3, murmurs of tricuspid regurgitation or pulmonic insufficiency, hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema. The peripheral edema may be a result of chronic lower extremity venous outflow obstruction related to the venous thromboembolic disease or right ventricular failure related to the progressive pulmonary hypertension.</p><p>A unique physical finding in some patients with CTEPH is the presence of flow murmurs over the lung fields. These subtle bruits appear to originate from turbulent flow through partially obstructed or recanalized pulmonary arteries. They are high pitched and blowing in quality, heard over the lung fields rather than the precordium, accentuated during inspiration, and frequently heard only during periods of breath-holding. They have not been described in patients with other types of pulmonary hypertension. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10889851\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation of symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is not commonly suspected when a patient presents with progressive dyspnea and exercise intolerance. Therefore, the diagnosis of CTEPH is typically delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/22,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26,27</a>]. More often, common conditions are suspected (eg, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive airways disease, asthma, interstitial lung disease, or deconditioning) and the patient is evaluated with echocardiography, pulmonary function testing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest radiography. In patients with CTEPH, these studies often suggest pulmonary hypertension:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography &ndash; The tricuspid regurgitant velocity and estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure are usually increased. Right atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy with reduced systolic function may be apparent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82034\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82034 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. There may also be leftward displacement of the septum, which can impair left ventricular filling and performance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary function tests &ndash; Most patients have a reduction in the single breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), which is out of proportion to any abnormalities in spirometry. A mild restrictive or obstructive defect may be present, although spirometry is often normal. The restrictive defect may be related to parenchymal scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], while the obstructive defect may be due to mucosal hyperemia caused by bronchial arterial collateral circulation. For those patients who have an arterial blood gas performed as part of their pulmonary function tests, an increased alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient and a decline in the arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) with exercise are typical. The resting PaO<sub>2</sub> may be normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary function tests'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiography &ndash; Chest radiography may demonstrate abnormalities related to either pulmonary embolic disease or pulmonary hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69313\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69313 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/23,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,30</a>]. Pulmonary embolic disease may cause areas of hypoperfusion or hyperperfusion, as well as evidence of old unilateral or bilateral pleural disease. Pulmonary hypertension can cause enlargement of both main pulmonary arteries, asymmetry in the size of the central pulmonary arteries, right atrial enlargement, or right ventricular enlargement. Right ventricular enlargement is suggested by encroachment into the normally empty retrosternal space on a lateral radiograph. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Chest radiograph'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10889858\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of suspected pulmonary hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once pulmonary hypertension becomes suspected, CTEPH should always be considered, particularly among patients with a history of venous thromboembolic disease, symptoms consistent with venous thromboembolic disease, or risk factors for venous thromboembolic disease. </p><p>Although falling out of favor as a diagnostic technique for acute pulmonary embolism, ventilation-perfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> lung scanning represents the initial imaging procedure of choice in patients presenting with newly diagnosed pulmonary hypertension. It can differentiate proximal large vessel types of pulmonary hypertension (eg, CTEPH, pulmonary artery sarcoma) from distal small vessel types (eg, group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension), which are the most common competing diagnostic possibilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/22,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,31</a>]. Patients with CTEPH generally have at least one (usually several) segmental or larger mismatched ventilation-perfusion defects, while patients with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension usually have a normal or mottled perfusion scan characterized by subsegmental defects.</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> lung scanning is preferred over computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CT-PA) as the initial test because it detects CTEPH with greater sensitivity. In other words, patients with CTEPH are more likely to have an abnormal <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> lung scan than an abnormal CT-PA. This was illustrated by an observational study that included 227 patients with pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> lung scanning and CT-PA identified CTEPH with a sensitivity of 96 and 51 percent, respectively. </p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> lung scanning is imperfect, as it often understates the extent of central pulmonary vascular obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Channels through central obstructing lesions or partial flow around them (a result of complex patterns of recanalization and organization that follow an embolic event) allow the radioisotopic agent to reach the periphery of the lung. These areas may appear normal or as hypoperfused gray zones, depending upon the distribution of flow. In addition, there are pulmonary hypertensive disorders other than CTEPH that can also be associated with segmental or larger perfusion defects on <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> lung scanning, including pulmonary artery sarcoma, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, fibrosing mediastinitis, large vessel pulmonary vasculitides, and extrinsic pulmonary vascular compression (arterial or venous).</p><p>For those patients whose <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> lung scanning suggests CTEPH, an additional imaging study is required. CT-PA is capable of detecting competing diagnostic possibilities, such as fibrosing mediastinitis. Both right heart catheterization and pulmonary angiography are indicated to confirm pulmonary hypertension, quantify the degree of pulmonary hypertension, exclude competing diagnoses, define the surgical accessibility of the obstructing thrombotic lesions, and confirm that an acceptable component of the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is due to surgically accessible disease and not from distal obstruction, a secondary arteriopathy, or pulmonary venous hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right heart catheterization &ndash; In patients with CTEPH, hemodynamic measurements at rest may demonstrate only a modest degree of pulmonary hypertension. In this situation, the measurements should be repeated after a short period of exercise. Exercise-related increases in cardiac output are accompanied by a disproportionate elevation of the pulmonary artery pressure when the normal compensatory mechanisms of pulmonary artery distension and recruitment are overcome by the chronic thromboembolic obstruction. Thus, pulmonary artery hypertension that is elicited by exercise but not present at rest may be an early indication of CTEPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary angiography &ndash; The angiographic findings in chronic thromboembolic disease bear little resemblance to the sharply defined intraluminal defects seen with acute pulmonary embolism. Five angiographic patterns are associated with the presence of organized thromboembolic material during thromboendarterectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59507\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59507 \">image 3</a>): pouch defects, pulmonary artery webs or bands, intimal irregularities, abrupt narrowing of the major pulmonary arteries, and obstruction of lobar or segmental vessels at their origin, with complete absence of blood flow to the pulmonary segments that are normally perfused by those vessels. Biplanar angiography provides a second dimensional viewpoint; the addition of a lateral view to the anterior view improves visualization of the lobar and segmental branches of the pulmonary artery, thereby enhancing interpretation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53088\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53088 \">image 4</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients in whom balloon pulmonary angioplasty is being considered, some experts report greater success with balloon angioplasty for discrete ring-like stenosis or web-like lesions. These data need to be replicated before the angiographic appearance of CTEPH lesions can be routinely used to select patients or predict outcome from this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Many clinicians believe that the vasodilation induced by the contrast agent might induce hypotension. This was addressed in a study that measured pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics during pulmonary angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Multiple bolus injections of nonionic contrast media did not cause any major adverse hemodynamic effects, even in the presence of severe pulmonary hypertension. All of the patients received supplemental oxygen.</p><p/><p>While in the past, pulmonary angioscopy was used to confirm the presence of chronic thromboembolic obstruction and determine whether the obstruction was accessible to surgical intervention, advances in noninvasive imaging techniques have eliminated the need for angioscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10889872\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, patients can be diagnosed with presumed CTEPH and referred for surgical correction without right heart catheterization or pulmonary angiography. In such patients, the diagnosis of CTEPH is made on the basis of echocardiographic findings plus either CT-PA or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT-PA &ndash; A variety of abnormalities may be seen on CT-PA in patients with CTEPH. These include right ventricular enlargement, chronic thromboembolic material within dilated central pulmonary arteries, bronchial artery collateral flow, and mosaic attenuation of the pulmonary parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. CT-PA was compared to conventional pulmonary angiography in an observational study that evaluated 55 patients who were suspected of having CTEPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Central pulmonary emboli were detected with similar accuracy by CT-PA and conventional pulmonary angiography, although segmental disease was detected more reliably with conventional pulmonary angiography. The limitations of CT-PA include its poor sensitivity in detecting chronic thromboemboli at the segmental level and its inability to differentiate an intraluminal thrombus from a well endothelialized chronic thrombus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI &ndash; MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) have been used to visualize the pulmonary vascular system and assess right ventricular size and function in patients with CTEPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. One single center study of 78 patients with CTEPH underwent gadolinium-enhanced lung perfusion MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

These symptoms can be caused by many conditions including coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive airways disease, asthma, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and deconditioning. The precise cause of the symptoms can usually be determined by history, physical exam, and diagnostic testing, such as pulmonary function tests, echocardiography, electrocardiography, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac stress testing. More than one cause of dyspnea may present, in which case the clinician should try to determine the relative contribution of each. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-diagnostic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with interstitial lung disease: Diagnostic testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When the initial diagnostic evaluation indicates that the likely cause of the dyspnea and exercise intolerance is pulmonary hypertension, the various types of pulmonary hypertension become the alternative possible diagnoses. The exact cause of the pulmonary hypertension may be obvious based upon the previous evaluation. As an example, the patient may have known systemic sclerosis or congenital heart disease, suggesting that the pulmonary hypertension is a consequence of these conditions. If the cause of the pulmonary hypertension is not apparent, additional testing is indicated. This may include chest computed tomography, ventilation-perfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q</span> scanning), overnight oximetry, polysomnography, and laboratory testing (eg, HIV serology, liver function tests, and antinuclear antibodies). The diagnostic evaluation of pulmonary hypertension is described in detail separately.

However, a minority of patients develop chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) following a single or recurrent episode of acute pulmonary embolism. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CTEPH usually present with progressive dyspnea and exercise intolerance. Occasionally, a patient will have waited to seek medical attention despite these symptoms and will report additional symptoms and signs related to pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular dysfunction, such as peripheral edema, exertional chest pain, syncope, or near-syncope. Many patients provide a history consistent with an acute pulmonary embolic event (eg, pleuritic chest pain, lower extremity discomfort, or a prolonged atypical pneumonia) months to years prior to the onset of the dyspnea, although documentation of an acute episode of venous thromboembolism may be absent and should not dissuade a clinician from considering the diagnosis of CTEPH. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CTEPH is not commonly suspected when a patient initially presents with progressive dyspnea and exercise intolerance. More often, common conditions are suspected (eg, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive airways disease, asthma, interstitial lung disease, or deconditioning) and the patient is evaluated with echocardiography, pulmonary function testing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest radiography. In patients with CTEPH, these studies often suggest pulmonary hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9358616\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once pulmonary hypertension becomes suspected, CTEPH should always be considered. Ventilation-perfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> lung scanning represents the initial imaging procedure of choice when CTEPH is being considered; patients with CTEPH generally have at least one (usually several) segmental or larger mismatched ventilation-perfusion defects. For those patients with evidence of CTEPH on <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> lung scanning, right heart catheterization and pulmonary angiography are indicated to confirm pulmonary hypertension, quantify the degree of pulmonary hypertension, exclude competing diagnoses, define the surgical accessibility of the obstructing thrombotic lesions, and confirm that an acceptable component of the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is due to surgically accessible disease and not from distal obstruction or a secondary arteriopathy. On occasion, patients can be referred for surgery based upon echocardiographic findings in conjunction with either computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CT-PA) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CTEPH requires that both of the following criteria be confirmed (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulmonary hypertension, defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) &ge;25 mmHg at rest in the absence of an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (ie, PCWP is &le;15 mmHg).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thromboembolic occlusion of the proximal or distal pulmonary vasculature must exist and be the presumed cause of the pulmonary hypertension.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Dartevelle P, Fadel E, Mussot S, et al.
