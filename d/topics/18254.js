Cryptorchid testes may be absent or undescended.</p><p><strong>Absent testis</strong> &ndash; An absent testis may be due to agenesis or atrophy secondary to intrauterine vascular compromise (eg, prenatal testicular torsion), also known as the &quot;vanishing testis syndrome&quot; or testicular regression syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Boys who have bilaterally absent testes have anorchia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-testicular-torsion#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal testicular torsion&quot;, section on 'Prenatal'</a>.)</p><p><strong>Undescended testes</strong> &ndash; True undescended testes have stopped short along their normal path of descent into the scrotum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78798\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78798 \">figure 1</a>). They may remain in the abdominal cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89319\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89319 \">picture 2</a>) or they may be palpable in the inguinal canal (intracanalicular) or just outside the external ring (suprascrotal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89318\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89318 \">picture 3</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p><strong>Retractile testes</strong> &ndash; Retractile testes are normal testes that have been pulled into a suprascrotal position by the cremasteric reflex. These testes can be brought into a dependent scrotal position and will remain there if the cremasteric reflex is overcome (eg, by holding the testis in the scrotum for at least one minute) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The intra-abdominal phase of descent is thought to be androgen-independent and mediated by descendin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78798\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78798 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Passage through the inguinal canal, which begins in the 28<sup>th</sup> week of gestation, is believed to result from interaction between mechanical, hormonal, and neurotransmitter effects. Changes in abdominal pressure, patency of the processus vaginalis, gubernacular regression, androgens, gonadotropins, m&uuml;llerian inhibiting substance (MIS), and calcitonin gene-related peptide are all thought to play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/9-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-15</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of undescended testes is less well understood than that of normal testicular descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Alterations in any of the factors that contribute to normal testicular descent may theoretically result in undescended testes. Gonadotropin deficiency in utero, decreased MIS, and increased expression of estradiol in the placenta have been proposed as contributing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p>Absent testes can result from agenesis or, much more commonly, intrauterine vascular compromise (eg, prenatal testicular torsion).</p><p>Ascending testes probably represent testes that have enough laxity in the spermatic cord to reach the scrotum in early childhood but become tethered in place and pulled out of the scrotum as the child grows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/10,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,21</a>].

Most (approximately 70 percent) congenitally undescended testes descend spontaneously so that by one year of age the prevalence is approximately 1 percent, which is similar to that in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/22,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27,28</a>].

Most cryptorchid testes are undescended, but some are absent (due to agenesis or atrophy). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True undescended testes have stopped short along their normal path of descent into the scrotum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78798\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78798 \">figure 1</a>). They may remain in the abdominal cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89319\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89319 \">picture 2</a>) or they may be palpable in the inguinal canal (intracanalicular) or just outside the external ring (suprascrotal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89318\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89318 \">picture 3</a>)). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 2 and 5 percent of full-term and approximately 30 percent of premature male infants are born with an undescended testis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryptorchidism usually is an isolated finding. However, it may occur in association with endocrine disorders, genetic syndromes, and morphologic abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H12267954\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical features of cryptorchidism include an empty and hypoplastic or poorly rugated scrotum or hemiscrotum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51355\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51355 \">picture 1</a>). Inguinal fullness may be present. Most congenitally undescended testes descend spontaneously by six months of age. (See <a href=\"#H83325436\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some testes that have fully descended in infancy will, later in childhood (typically between the ages of four and eight years), ascend to an undescended position. (See <a href=\"#H83325436\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of cryptorchidism typically includes history and physical examination. Imaging and laboratory studies are not routinely warranted but may be necessary to exclude associated conditions. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic approach to cryptorchidism depends upon whether the testis is palpable or nonpalpable. (See <a href=\"#H425989631\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The diagnosis of a truly undescended testis can be made with history and examination if the testis is palpable in the inguinal canal or just outside the external ring, and has been in this position since birth. Unlike retractile testes, palpable undescended testes cannot be milked into a normal scrotal position <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> will not remain in a normal scrotal position if the cremasteric reflex is overcome. Palpable undescended testes are differentiated from ectopic testes by their position (intracanalicular or suprascrotal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89318\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89318 \">picture 3</a>) versus suprapubic, femoral canal, perineum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89320\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89320 \">picture 4</a>), or contralateral scrotal compartment). (See <a href=\"#H179825667\" class=\"local\">'Palpable cryptorchid testes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The major diagnostic considerations for a unilateral nonpalpable testis include true undescended testis, absent testis, and ectopic testis. Surgical exploration is usually necessary to distinguish among these possibilities. (See <a href=\"#H83332739\" class=\"local\">'Unilateral nonpalpable testis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-management#H170004\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Exploratory surgery'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The major diagnostic considerations for bilateral nonpalpable testes include disorders of sexual development, true undescended testes, anorchia, and bilateral testicular atrophy. The diagnostic evaluation differs depending on age. (See <a href=\"#H83332746\" class=\"local\">'Bilateral nonpalpable testes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phenotypically male newborn infants with bilateral nonpalpable testes, unilateral nonpalpable testis with hypospadias, or suspected disorder of sexual development (including congenital adrenal hyperplasia) should be immediately referred to a multidisciplinary team for evaluation and initial management of possible disorder of sexual development.
