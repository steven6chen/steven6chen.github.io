Increased clinician training, smaller diameter hysteroscopes, and increased emphasis on office-based procedures have led to a widespread use of this important technology.</p><p>A hysteroscope is a telescope that is inserted into the uterus via the vagina and cervix to visualize the endometrial cavity, as well as the tubal ostia, endocervical canal, cervix, and vagina. Hysteroscopy can be performed for diagnostic or therapeutic indications.</p><p>An overview of hysteroscopy is presented here. Vaginoscopy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysteroscopy is performed for evaluation or treatment of the endometrial cavity, tubal ostia, or endocervical canal in women with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal premenopausal or postmenopausal uterine bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrial thickening or polyps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Submucosal, and some intramural, fibroids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrauterine adhesions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M&uuml;llerian anomalies (eg, uterine septum)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retained intrauterine contraceptives or other foreign bodies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retained products of conception</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desire for sterilization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocervical lesions</p><p/><p>There are several approaches to evaluating women with abnormal uterine bleeding or intrauterine lesions (pelvic sonography, saline infusion sonography, endometrial sampling, hysterosalpingography). Using hysteroscopy for the initial evaluation offers the potential benefit of combining evaluation with treatment. Also, hysteroscopy avoids the risk of missing focal pathology, as may occur with blind endometrial sampling.</p><p>Alternatively, hysteroscopy can be used to further evaluate or treat lesions identified on imaging studies (eg, normal endometrial echo detected with transvaginal ultrasound), or to confirm the absence of disease when symptoms persist and initial diagnostic tests are normal (eg, blind endometrial sampling). Using hysteroscopy to follow-up abnormal imaging findings helps to rule out ovarian or tubal pathology that may contribute to abnormal uterine bleeding.</p><p>A detailed discussion of the choice between hysteroscopy and other methods of endometrial evaluation can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the endometrium for malignant or premalignant disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-sampling-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial sampling procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hysteroscopy cannot assess myometrial disease (eg, adenomyosis), tubal pathology, or the external uterine contour; thus, it is not sufficient for evaluation of these anatomic structures during an infertility evaluation. Additional procedures (eg, laparoscopy or hysterosalpingography) are necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraindications to hysteroscopy are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viable intrauterine pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active pelvic infection (including genital herpes infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Known cervical or uterine cancer</p><p/><p>While hysteroscopy should not be performed in a patient with a viable intrauterine pregnancy, postpartum or post-abortal hysteroscopy is sometimes useful for evaluation and treatment of retained products of conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Excessive uterine bleeding may limit visualization during hysteroscopy, but it is not a contraindication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Operative challenges'</a> below).</p><p>Medical comorbidities (eg, coronary heart disease, bleeding diathesis) are also potential contraindications to hysteroscopic surgery. However, since this is a minimally invasive procedure, it is rarely contraindicated in few women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-principles-of-medical-consultation-and-perioperative-medicine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the principles of medical consultation and perioperative medicine&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INSTRUMENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rigid hysteroscope includes an outer sheath which surrounds channels for the telescope, distending media inflow and outflow, and operative instruments. Additional equipment is needed for infusing and monitoring uterine distending media.</p><p>There are many different sizes and type of hysteroscopes. Some are better suited for diagnostic versus operative procedures, or for outpatient rather than operating room procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hysteroscopes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Outer diameter and working length</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outer diameter &mdash; The total outer diameter (OD) of a hysteroscope refers to the diameter of the sheath, a metal tube which houses the telescope and instruments. Sheath ODs range from 3.1 to 10 mm.<br/><br/>Smaller OD hysteroscopes cause less pain and decrease the need for mechanical dilation. Even reducing the sheath size from 5 to 3.3 mm can improve patient comfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In general, inserting a hysteroscope with &gt;5 mm OD will require mechanical cervical dilation; most patients will experience discomfort and will require analgesia (eg, paracervical block, peri-procedural nonsteroidal agents). In addition, analgesia is typically required for operative procedures. Diagnostic procedures performed with smaller OD sheaths can usually be performed without dilation and in the office.</p><p/><p>Both diagnostic and operative sheaths are fitted with stopcocks or ports for the instillation of distending media. To clear blood and thus improve visualization of the uterine cavity, some operative sheaths have dual ports that provide continuous laminar flow of distending media. In addition, some operative sheaths aspirate pieces of tissue from the uterine cavity (ie, to remove debris or retrieve specimens for pathologic evaluation). This allows removal of large debris while maintaining cervical dilation (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Distending media'</a> below).<br/><br/>Selected diagnostic hysteroscopes permit targeted biopsies and retrieval of foreign bodies, as well as limited intrauterine surgery (removal of filmy adhesions or small endometrial polyps).<br/><br/>Simple operative sheaths use the distending media channel for the insertion of instruments. Although this method is easy and allows one to use a small-diameter sheath, leaks of media are common.<br/><br/>Advanced operative sheaths may have three channels: two for operative instruments and one for instilling distending media.</p><p>Other operative sheaths contain permanently attached operative tools, such as biopsy instruments, forceps, or scissors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Working length &mdash; The working length of a hysteroscope measures from the eyepiece to the distal tip, and can range from 160 to 302 mm. A longer working element permits the hysteroscopist to be further away from the vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Rigid versus flexible</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most hysteroscopes are rigid, but narrow caliber scopes (&lt;5 mm) may also be semi-rigid or flexible. Rigid hysteroscopes cause more intraoperative pain, but offer better optical quality and are less costly. This was illustrated in a randomized trial that assigned 144 pre- and postmenopausal women undergoing outpatient diagnostic hysteroscopy to a 3.7 mm rigid or 3.6 mm flexible hysteroscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Both groups received topical cervical anesthesia. Compared with flexible hysteroscopes, use of a rigid hysteroscope was associated with significantly more pain, but better optical quality and ease of insertion.</p><p>Flexible hysteroscopy is especially useful for diagnostic or operative procedures in women with an irregularly shaped uterus, as the distal tip can be deflected upward or downward (eg, for tubal cannulation or lysis of adhesions near the tubal ostia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59639\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59639 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Optics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quality of visualization varies among hysteroscopic telescopes. In general, the higher quality cameras have larger ODs and are more costly. Thus, narrow caliber telescopes provide adequate quality for routine diagnostic procedures, while the high quality cameras are preferable for advanced operative hysteroscopy.</p><p>The telescope consists of three parts: the eyepiece, barrel, and objective lens. The image depends upon characteristics of these components. Hysteroscopes are monocular (single eyepiece), and thus, provide little depth perception. The surgeon can look directly through the eyepiece or view the image via a video monitoring system. Use of a video monitoring system allows other operating room personnel and the patient to view the procedure and also allows still photographs and video recordings for documentation.</p><p>Viewing angles range from zero to 70 degrees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58867\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58867 \">figure 1</a>). A zero degree hysteroscope provides a panoramic view in line with the sheath. Increasing viewing angles allow the surgeon to visualize areas to the left or right of midline without shifting the telescope from side to side (eg, to view the tubal ostia or a focal lesion in an irregularly shaped cavity).</p><p>There are two main hysteroscopic optical systems: direct optical and contact. The direct optical hysteroscope, derived from the cystoscope, provides the surgeon with a global view of the uterine cavity. A distending medium is used and the image is well-illuminated and has excellent contrast and resolution.</p><p>Conversely, contact hysteroscopes work without a distending medium and provide only a focal view of the endometrial cavity, since only tissue in direct contact with the scope can be viewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, unless the uterine cavity is explored in a slow, systematic fashion, significant pathology can be missed. This approach is rarely used.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light source &mdash; Illumination for hysteroscopy is provided by a light source connected to the hysteroscope by a fiberoptic cable. Fiberoptics allow transmission of bright light without the transmission of significant heat.<br/><br/>Most light sources are either halogen or xenon. Either type of lamp provides adequate illumination for operative procedures, photography, and videotaping; xenon lamps are more expensive than halogen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Operative instrumentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Operative hysteroscopes are used to remove endocervical or endometrial lesions (eg, submucosal myomas, endometrial polyps) or to perform an endometrial <span class=\"nowrap\">ablation/resection</span>. Some, but not all, operative hysteroscopes use electrosurgical cutting. Laser is rarely used in modern hysteroscopic procedures.</p><p>The three types of operative hysteroscopes are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operative sheath with instruments inserted through channels or fixed to the sheath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrosurgical resectoscope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysteroscopic morcellator</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1572821\"><span class=\"h3\">Operative sheaths</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An assortment of flexible, semirigid, and rigid instruments have been developed or adapted for hysteroscopic surgery.<br/><br/>Flexible and semirigid instruments range in diameter from 2 to 3 mm and are inserted through an operating channel in the sheath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These instruments include scissors, grasping forceps, biopsy forceps, and punctate electrodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82008%7EOBGYN%2F69759\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82008 graphicRef69759 \">picture 2A-B</a>). Semirigid or flexible instruments may be fragile, and must be handled with care to avoid damage.<br/><br/>Rigid instruments may also be inserted through a channel, or may be fixed to the end of the hysteroscope. Fixed instruments are not commonly used, since they must be inserted, removed, and manipulated along with the entire hysteroscope.<br/><br/>Some systems have sheaths which use suction to retrieve tissue fragments without removing the hysteroscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1572828\"><span class=\"h3\">Resectoscopes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resectoscopes typically consist of a 7 to 9 mm sheath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74123\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74123 \">picture 3</a>). They use radiofrequency electrical energy which may be either monopolar or bipolar. When a monopolar resectoscope is used, the patient must be grounded and a nonconducting (ie, nonelectrolyte), distending medium must be used. Bipolar resectoscopes are a newer development and can be used with electrolyte distending media, eg, saline or Ringer's lactate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Distending media'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electrosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electrosurgery&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Traditionally, radiofrequency tools for the resectoscope have included the loop (tissue cutting) and rollerball (coagulation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55853\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55853 \">picture 4</a>). Newer vaporizing electrodes (eg, VaporTrode, Versapoint) have been introduced that vaporize lesions and thus obviate the need to remove floating pieces of tissue. Of course, they are not appropriate for procedures in which a specimen is needed for histology.<br/><br/>Assembly of resectoscopes generally requires some practice and should be mastered before a surgical procedure is undertaken (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69544%7EOBGYN%2F50056%7EOBGYN%2F62804%7EOBGYN%2F75612\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69544 graphicRef50056 graphicRef62804 graphicRef75612 \">picture 5A-D</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1572835\"><span class=\"h3\">Hysteroscopic morcellator</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hysteroscopic morcellator consists of a rotary blade that cuts lesions; tissue is then aspirated through the morcellator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Morcellators, which are inserted through the working channel of hysteroscope, exist for use with 6 mm, 7 mm, and 9 mm hysteroscopes. The morcellator does not use radiofrequency electrical energy, and thus, is not able to coagulate bleeding vessels encountered during surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Distending media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysteroscopy is performed using a distending medium to provide a global view of the endometrial cavity.</p><p>The most commonly used distending media are low viscosity fluids and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is used for diagnostic procedures. The management of fluid and gaseous distending media is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopy: Managing fluid and gas distending media&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL PLANNING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing an operative setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outpatient settings are increasingly common for diagnostic and some operative hysteroscopy (eg, hysteroscopic sterilization, removal of small lesions or adhesions). Ambulatory settings are acceptable to patients, time-saving, and cost-effective compared with operating room procedures, and should be used, whenever feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach to outpatient hysteroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common reasons for failure to complete an outpatient hysteroscopy are pain, cervical stenosis, and poor visualization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

NSAID use has been associated with reduced post-hysteroscopy pain and can be used postoperatively as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].

Diagnostic hysteroscopy, particularly in the outpatient setting, relies upon a small outer diameter (OD) to minimize both the need for cervical dilation and patient discomfort.</p><p>For minor procedures performed in the outpatient setting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> under local anesthetic, it also makes sense to balance OD and optical quality. However, in general, a larger OD will be required to accommodate operative instruments compared with diagnostic hysteroscopy.</p><p>Advanced operative procedures require an operative hysteroscope with one or two channels for instruments and also a high quality telescope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing a distending medium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic procedures can be performed using either carbon dioxide or normal saline. For operative procedures that use monopolar electrosurgical instruments, a nonconductive fluid (eg, glycine) is required to avoid thermal injury.

Patients should be informed of possible need to abandon or prematurely stop a procedure due to fluid overload. Also, since uterine perforation is a possible complication, patients should consent to a possible laparoscopy or laparotomy if it becomes necessary to rule out visceral or vascular injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of preoperative evaluation and preparation for gynecologic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A medical history is taken, including: detailed questions regarding symptoms that relate to the indication for the procedure; obstetrical and surgical history; and medical comorbidities, medications, and allergies. A complete pelvic and general physical examination is performed, with particular attention to the size and mobility of the uterus and the patency of the cervix. Pregnancy testing is performed; cervical cultures are appropriate if cervicitis is suspected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing and endometrial preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For premenopausal women with regular menstrual cycles, the proliferative phase is best for visualization of the uterine cavity. During the secretory phase, the thick endometrium can mimic endometrial polyps and lead to inaccurate diagnoses. Also, during menstruation, blood may interfere with visualization.</p><p>In reproductive age women with irregular uterine bleeding, the ideal time for the procedure is unpredictable. Thus, patients should be counseled that a procedure may be attempted, but may need to be rescheduled if obscuring blood makes it impossible to evaluate the uterine cavity. Often, surgery is still feasible, because fluid pumps facilitate visualization by rapidly clearing debris and blood (see <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Operative challenges'</a> below).</p><p>Another approach is pharmacologic thinning of the endometrium. Thinning agents should be used only when the surgeon plans operative hysteroscopic resection of a leiomyoma or endometrial ablation. Thinning agents should not be used when diagnostic hysteroscopy alone is planned, as these hormones may influence the histology of the endometrium. The most commonly used agents are estrogen-progestin contraceptives or progestins alone (eg, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> 10 mg daily on cycle days 15 to 26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> are also effective, but are used infrequently due to adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. All of these agents require at least two months of therapy to effectively thin the endometrium. Regimens that require a shorter duration of therapy have been proposed (eg, desogestrel and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>For postmenopausal women, hysteroscopy may be performed at any time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical preparation and dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate cervical dilation is an important step in hysteroscopy, as nearly 50 percent of hysteroscopic complications are associated with difficult passage of the hysteroscope through the cervical canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Not all women will require cervical dilation for hysteroscopy, namely premenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopy with a narrow caliber (&lt;5 mm) or flexible hysteroscope. Women who benefit from cervical dilation include those having procedures with larger hysteroscopes (&ge;5 mm), women with a history of cervical stenosis or cervical surgery, and postmenopausal women. </p><p>Cervical dilation can be done mechanically at the time of the procedure (dilators) or done preoperatively with cervical ripening agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dinoprostone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dinoprostone</a>) or vaginal osmotic dilators (laminaria). Preoperative dilation is generally preferred because it avoids or reduces the need for mechanical dilation and the associated risks of pain, uterine perforation, and false track creation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/12,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilation-and-curettage#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dilation and curettage&quot;, section on 'Cervical dilation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilation-and-curettage#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dilation and curettage&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.) </p><p>In our practice, for women expected to need cervical dilation for hysteroscopy, we pretreat with 200 to 400 mcg of vaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> 12 to 24 hours prior to hysteroscopy. In a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 trials addressing preoperative cervical ripening prior to operative hysteroscopy, pre- and postmenopausal women treated with misoprostol were much less likely to require additional mechanical dilation than women treated with placebo or no intervention (odds ratio [OR] 0.08, 95% CI 0.04-0.16) or women treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dinoprostone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dinoprostone</a> (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.34-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. As an illustration of this effect, if mechanical dilation would normally be needed in 80 percent of untreated women undergoing hysteroscopy, the use of misoprostol would reduce the need for mechanical dilation to between 14 and 39 percent of women based on this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis also reported that women receiving misoprostol pretreatment had fewer complications than those treated with placebo (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.77) or those treated with dinoprostone (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.83). The side effects of misoprostol included mild abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and increased body temperature. </p><p>Although prior trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> in postmenopausal women had reported conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>], the meta-analysis above, which only included two trials in the analysis of postmenopausal women, did demonstrate a benefit of misoprostol in this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, pretreatment of postmenopausal women with vaginal estrogen (25 mcg daily) for two weeks before surgery may augment the cervical dilation caused by misoprostol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The optimal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> pretreatment dose, route, and timing have not been determined; most studies have used 200 to 400 mcg. While trials comparing oral versus vaginal administration of misoprostol have reported conflicting results regarding superiority, both routes of administration appear to improve pre-operative cervical dilation and ease of procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In another study that compared 400 mcg of misoprostol inserted vaginally either 12 or 3 hours prior to the procedure, the women in the 12-hour group had easier insertion of the hysteroscope and reported less pain than the women in the 3-hour group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Thus, we ask women to self-administer misoprostol (200 to 400 mcg) vaginally the night before the procedure. For women who cannot or prefer not to use a vaginal medication, oral dosing is a reasonable alternative. &#160; &#160;</p><p>Another option for preoperative cervical dilation is osmotic dilation (eg, laminaria). However, we do not use laminaria as they are typically inserted in the office on the day prior to the procedure and therefore require an additional visit for the patient. Although a meta-analysis (one trial, 110 women) and a separate trial of 150 women both reported a reduced need for intraoperative cervical dilation after laminaria pretreatment compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> pretreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/31,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,40</a>], we do not believe this difference warrants the extra time and cost of an additional office visit because the intraoperative complication rates were the same between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Some women find uterine biopsy to be the most painful part of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Managing pain or discomfort encompasses not just medication, but also patient counseling, complimentary treatments (eg, guided visualization or listening to music [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]), and selection of the type of procedure and instruments.

The benefits of not using anesthesia include no adverse medication reactions, reduced procedure time and cost, and avoidance of a pain-inducing paracervical block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/43,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,47</a>]. Not using anesthesia appears particularly appropriate for diagnostic procedures using a hysteroscope that is &lt;4 mm in diameter. In a trial of over 350 postmenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopy, women who underwent hysteroscopy with a 3.5 mm hysteroscope and no anesthetic had significantly less pain than women who had the procedure with a 5 mm hysteroscope, even when a paracervical block was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. &#160;</p><p>For women undergoing simple operative hysteroscopy (eg, IUD removal) or hysteroscopy with a hysteroscope 4 mm or larger, we prefer a paracervical block because it is low cost, well tolerated, and reduces some aspects of pain.

The cervix should not be dilated beyond the size of the hysteroscope, since this may cause leakage of distending medium.</p><p>A removable obturator (rod within the sheath) is especially helpful for introduction of the sheath into the uterine cavity when entry is difficult. However, it is generally advisable to introduce the hysteroscope under direct visualization to be able to navigate through the cervical canal.</p><p>Once the hysteroscope has been inserted, it is helpful to remove the speculum; using a bivalve speculum (open on one side) makes this possible. Insert the hysteroscope through the cervical os under direct endoscopic vision and remove the speculum.</p><p>Some experts advocate an alternative approach to the classic initial entry (particularly for diagnostic procedures) technique, the vaginoscopic technique, which avoids the use of a speculum or tenaculum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginoscopic technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vaginoscopic, or &quot;no touch,&quot; technique is performed without a speculum or tenaculum and without anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Women with cervical stenosis are not candidates for this approach. A meta-analysis of six randomized trials found that use of the vaginoscopic versus traditional technique was associated with a significant decrease in operative pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Failed procedures were infrequent for both techniques. Some, but not all, randomized trials have found that operative time was shorter for the vaginoscopic technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>].</p><p>To perform the vaginoscopic technique, perform a bimanual pelvic examination with the patient in the dorsal lithotomy position. Prepare the vaginal introitus with saline or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Without using a speculum, introduce a rigid or semi-rigid, narrow caliber (&lt;4 mm) hysteroscope into the vaginal introitus. Infuse normal saline at a pressure of 150 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Close the labia minora manually if needed to contain the distending medium.

The entire cavity is inspected, including the tubal ostia and any pathology. It is often helpful to take photographs for documentation and communication with the patient.</p><p>Whether using a gaseous or fluid medium, after initial uterine distension, deflate the endometrial cavity. This will prevent &quot;negative hysteroscopic view&quot; (ie, flattening of lesions by the pressure of distension, thereby making them difficult to see).</p><p>In general, 1 to 3 percent of benign or malignant endometrial lesions are missed on hysteroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. To avoid missing uterine pathology, endometrial sampling (hysteroscopic biopsies or blind sampling) should be performed in patients with global endometrial pathology or with persistent bleeding and no hysteroscopic findings.</p><p>Women with focal pathology should undergo hysteroscopically directed removal of lesions.

When these symptoms occur, useful measures are: stopping the procedure, placing the patient in supine position with her legs raised or in the Trendelenburg position, and administering intravenous fluid. Some patients may require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> (0.5 to 1 mg IV every five minutes, not to exceed a total of 3 mg or 0.04 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> or &quot;smelling salts&quot; (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aromatic-ammonia-spirit-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aromatic ammonia spirit</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">OPERATIVE CHALLENGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several reasons for hysteroscopic failure. As noted above, in the office setting, pain, cervical stenosis, and poor visualization are the most common reasons for terminating a procedure. In addition, advanced operative hysteroscopy may need to be halted due to excessive fluid absorption or uterine perforation (which precludes adequate uterine distension). In a systematic review of over 26,000 procedures, the overall rate of failure was 3.6 percent, and was similar in ambulatory and hospitalized patients and pre- and postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pre-procedure cervical ripening with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> and small diameter instruments can reduce the frequency of procedure failure due to cervical stenosis. In postmenopausal women with cervical stenosis, one option is to treat with two to four weeks or more of vaginal estrogen prior to the procedure to soften the cervix and thereby facilitate the action of misoprostol, although the efficacy of this approach has not been proven (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Cervical preparation and dilation'</a> above).</p><p>When dilation of the cervix is difficult, a flexible hysteroscope may be passed more easily than a rigid dilator or sound. Also, the direct view helps to navigate the canal.</p><p>For women who fail these measures, intracervical injection of dilute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> (4 units per 80 mL normal saline) has been reported to facilitate cervical dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Although generally well tolerated, vasopressin injection must be performed with caution (by aspirating and confirming the absence of blood in the syringe prior to each injection), since intravascular injection or absorption has been associated with profound hypertension, bradycardia, and intraoperative mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>If a small dilator cannot be easily inserted, hysteroscopy can be performed under ultrasound guidance to confirm correct passage of the dilator into the endometrial cavity and make sure a false passage is not created.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine malposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extreme uterine retroversion or anteversion may be congenital or may be due to pelvic adhesions. Such malposition may limit the ability to introduce the hysteroscope. Traction with a tenaculum on the anterior lip of the cervix will often straighten the uterine axis. Also, use of a flexible hysteroscope may be helpful. Of note, malposition may increase the risk of uterine perforation.</p><p>When the uterus is severely angulated, the tubal ostia must be visualized to confirm that the entire uterine cavity has been evaluated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Difficult uterine distention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the cervix has been dilated, it is unusual to have difficulty instilling a distention medium.

When lavage is not possible, then dilation and curettage can be performed to remove endometrial debris and clots.

Women with diffuse bleeding should be evaluated for coagulopathy.</p><p>If coagulation testing is normal and diffuse bleeding continues, it can be treated by placing a Foley catheter in the uterine cavity and then distending the bulb with 15 to 30 mL of water. In one series of 216 resectoscope procedures, four women (1.9 percent) developed postoperative uterine bleeding and were successfully treated with this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Postoperative bleeding (with no suspicion of uterine perforation), can also be managed with this technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrosurgical injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thermal effects of radiofrequency or laser energy can cause injuries to the uterine cavity, as well as bowel, urinary bladder, and large pelvic vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In particular, a significant risk of bowel injury has been reported from hysteroscopic coagulation of the tubal cornua for sterilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. One must be cautious if coagulating in the tubal recesses.</p><p>The risk of thermal injury can be minimized by always moving the electrical instrument when it is activated because the temperature of the uterine serosal surface does not rise appreciably if the instrument is not held stationary during coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Vaginal thermal injury may result from overdilation of the cervix or activation of current when the external sheath is less than 2 cms past the external cervical os [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Electrode insulation defects can also cause thermal injury.</p><p>Sepsis generally results from unrecognized thermal bowel injury; fistulae or urinary ascites can occur from an unrecognized bladder injury.

Studies of 2000 or more procedures report postoperative incidences of 0.1 to 0.9 percent incidence for endometritis and 0.6 percent for urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hysteroscopy/abstract/63,64,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64,72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46\"><span class=\"h2\">Dissemination of tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concerns regarding the dissemination of malignant cells during hysteroscopy are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysteroscopy in outpatient settings is increasingly common. Advances in instrumentation, including narrow caliber hysteroscopes, decrease patient discomfort and have facilitated use of local anesthetic and ambulatory procedures. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Hysteroscopes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During hysteroscopy, the uterus is distended with a gas or fluid medium. Each medium has benefits and risks, including fluid overload or gas embolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopy: Managing fluid and gas distending media&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most women will need cervical dilation to undergo hysteroscopy. Preoperative cervical ripening can reduce the need for mechanical dilation at the time of hysteroscopy and its attendant risks. We suggest preoperative cervical ripening with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> rather than no preoperative treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We prescribe misoprostol 200 mcg to be inserted into the posterior vaginal fornix the night prior to the procedure. Premenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopy with a flexible or narrow (&lt;5 mm) scope may not require dilation at all and thus not benefit from cervical ripening. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Cervical preparation and dilation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely administered during hysteroscopy since posthysteroscopy infection is rare. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most diagnostic and brief or minor operative procedures can be performed without anesthetic or with a local anesthetic. Regional or general anesthesia is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate a procedure under local anesthesia, extensive operative procedures, or patients with comorbidities that necessitate intensive monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women undergoing hysteroscopy under local anesthetic, we suggest a paracervical block over other methods of administering local anesthesia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vaginoscopic technique for hysteroscopy avoids the use of a speculum and tenaculum. This may decrease patient discomfort in some procedures. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Vaginoscopic technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysteroscopic complications are infrequent. Major complications include: uterine perforation, fluid overload, and gas embolism.
