The goal of therapy in an acute gout attack is prompt and safe termination of pain and disability. Without therapy, acute gouty arthritis usually resolves completely within a few days to several weeks, particularly in early disease. However, symptoms improve more quickly with administration of any of a broad array of antiinflammatory drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;, section on 'Gout flares'</a>.)</p><p>Upon resolution of an acute attack, the patient is said to have entered a symptom-free (interval, intercritical, or between attacks) period. However, flares of acute gout recur in the great majority of patients; with more frequent episodes, attacks may be more severe and prolonged, with consequent shortening of asymptomatic periods. Patients with recurrent flares and those who develop chronic arthritis can benefit from long-term prophylactic therapy with a urate-lowering agent to prevent further recurrences of acute gout and chronic tophaceous disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy and treatment of tophi in patients with gout&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout#H56519131\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;, section on 'Intercritical gout and recurrent gout flares'</a>.)</p><p>The management of acute gouty arthritis will be reviewed here. The approach to asymptomatic hyperuricemia; the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of gout; and the prevention of recurrent gout after resolution of the acute attack are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asymptomatic-hyperuricemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asymptomatic hyperuricemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of gout&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy and treatment of tophi in patients with gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11160517\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL THERAPEUTIC PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several classes of antiinflammatory agents are effective for the treatment of acute gout, including systemic and intraarticular glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, and biologic agents that inhibit the action of interleukin (IL)-1 beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. A set of general principles is important in the effective management of acute gout, regardless of the specific antiinflammatory agent used. These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early treatment</strong> &ndash; Treatment should start as soon as possible after the patient perceives the beginning of an attack, preferably within several hours of symptom onset. More rapid and complete resolution of symptoms occurs the earlier that treatment is introduced, especially if treatment is initiated at the full recommended dose of the chosen antiinflammatory agent. Patients should be continued on treatment for the duration of the attack, usually at reduced doses once a significant reduction in symptoms is achieved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Duration of therapy</strong> &ndash; Complete cessation of treatment for the acute flare can usually be safely done within two to three days of complete resolution of the attack; however, in the case of oral glucocorticoids, we taper more slowly to lower the risk of a recurrent (&quot;rebound&quot;) attack. (See <a href=\"#H599999754\" class=\"local\">'Oral glucocorticoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12718805\" class=\"local\">'Administration of NSAIDs'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3146384137\" class=\"local\">'Administration of colchicine'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The duration of therapy for the acute attack may range from only a few days (eg, in a patient treated within hours of symptom onset) to several weeks (eg, in a patient begun on treatment after four or five days of symptoms). Many patients require antiinflammatory treatment for an acute attack for no more than five to seven days if begun on therapy within 12 to 36 hours of symptom onset.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gout flare prophylaxis</strong> &ndash; Low-dose antiinflammatory therapy should generally be continued during the early months of urate-lowering treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. The intent of this treatment, called antiinflammatory gout flare prophylaxis, is to reduce the risk of additional flares, which are common early in the course of urate-lowering treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy and treatment of tophi in patients with gout&quot;, section on 'Prophylaxis during initiation of urate-lowering therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Continuing urate-lowering therapy during attacks</strong> &ndash; In patients already receiving urate-lowering pharmacotherapy at the time of an acute flare (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febuxostat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">febuxostat</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">probenecid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lesinurad-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lesinurad</a>, benzbromarone, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegloticase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pegloticase</a>), the urate-lowering medication should be continued without interruption. There is no benefit to temporary discontinuation, and subsequent reintroduction after a period off the agent may predispose to another attack.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, urate-lowering therapies are of no direct benefit in the treatment of an acute gout attack, and whether to initiate a urate-lowering agent along with antiinflammatory therapy during a flare is controversial, as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy and treatment of tophi in patients with gout&quot;, section on 'Initiation and duration of urate-lowering pharmacotherapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Therapeutic recommendations for acute gout attacks in patients receiving urate-lowering agents are the same as those for patients not taking such therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy and treatment of tophi in patients with gout&quot;, section on 'Initiation and duration of urate-lowering pharmacotherapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tophaceous gout</strong> &ndash; Treatment of acute gout attacks does not differ substantially in patients with or without clinically apparent tophi, although the presence of tophi is an indication for the initiation of long-term urate-lowering pharmacotherapy either during or following resolution of the acute attack to prevent or reverse chronic gouty arthropathy. Urate-lowering therapy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy and treatment of tophi in patients with gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Comorbidities</strong> &ndash; Important comorbidities (and their ongoing therapies) that are frequent among gout patients may affect antiinflammatory drug safety or effectiveness, especially in older patients (see <a href=\"#H12719033\" class=\"local\">'Older adults'</a> below); consideration of these disorders is critical in the choice of antiinflammatory treatment for acute gout. The following factors are of particular importance in selecting an agent:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renal function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, poorly controlled hypertension, and coronary artery disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gastrointestinal disease, including peptic ulcer disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Concurrent medication use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diabetes mellitus, especially if poorly controlled</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drug allergy or intolerance</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adjunctive measures</strong> &ndash; Adjunctive measures, none of which are of proven efficacy, are often administered for symptom relief and include icing the affected joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], resting the joint that is involved, and administering analgesic medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or opioids). These measures do not substitute for effective antiinflammatory treatment of the acute gout attack.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85444272\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several different therapies, including systemic and intraarticular glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, are each effective for the treatment of acute gout; there is no single best agent for all patients experiencing an acute flare of gout. The availability of multiple classes of agents and approaches likely to provide treatment benefit permits the opportunity to choose which therapy, based upon an assessment of specific features of the individual patient and the flare history, is most likely to achieve benefit and minimize the risk of adverse therapeutic consequences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1764187732\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors affecting drug choice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors that may influence the choice of medication include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient-related medical factors</strong> &ndash; These include patient comorbidities (nature, number, and current clinical status), past medical history, concomitant medication use, allergies, and childbearing status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The patient's gout history</strong> &ndash; In patients with a previously established diagnosis of gout (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout#H87541850\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>), these include total flare number, recent rate of flare occurrence, and patient prior flare experience with specific therapies (antiinflammatory agent tolerability and effectiveness).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Differential diagnosis of flare symptoms</strong> &ndash; In patients in whom the current flare is atypical for the patient's prior gout flares, the diagnosis of gout has not been established, or the flare occurs in a high-risk setting, particular attention should be directed to the likelihood of an alternative or an accompanying cause of acute inflammatory arthritis (eg, infection). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout#H3404322\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis of a gout flare'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Characteristics of the acute flare</strong> &ndash; Variables that may influence the choice of agent and route of therapy with respect to the current flare include the duration of flare from symptom onset to therapeutic assessment, the number of affected joints and the injection accessibility of the inflamed joint(s), and the clinical setting in which the flare is occurring (eg, during initiation of urate-lowering, during a postoperative period, or when the patient is unable to take medications by mouth).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Logistic factors</strong> &ndash; These include issues such as drug availability and cost, the location of the patient (eg, home or clinic), and clinician expertise in arthrocentesis and joint injection.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H425622375\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We take the following approach to patients with an acute gout flare, which depends upon knowledge of the contextual medical and other factors that influence the relative safety and efficacy of each agent in individual patients (see <a href=\"#H1764187732\" class=\"local\">'Factors affecting drug choice'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral therapies</strong> &ndash; In patients with established gout experiencing a gout flare typical of prior attacks and able to take oral medications, we suggest oral glucocorticoids or NSAIDs; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> is a safe and effective alternative for some patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Oral glucocorticoids</strong> &ndash; We use oral glucocorticoids in many patients, particularly those who are not candidates for intraarticular glucocorticoid injection and those who have contraindications to use of NSAIDs. The initial dose is 30 to 40 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> given once daily or in a divided twice-daily dose; the duration of therapy depends upon several factors. (See <a href=\"#H599999754\" class=\"local\">'Oral glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Glucocorticoids are similar in efficacy to other agents and have no greater risk of adverse effects in most patients, although other options may be preferred in patients with concomitant infection, prior glucocorticoid intolerance, brittle diabetes, and those who are in a postoperative period in whom glucocorticoids may increase risk of impaired wound healing. In addition, NSAIDs or low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> may be preferred over glucocorticoids in patients with frequently recurrent attacks to avoid excessive total glucocorticoid dosing over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Caution in the initiation of oral glucocorticoid acute flare therapy is also called for when either a first or recurrent acute attack is accompanied by fever, chills, or other systemic symptoms or clinical signs suggesting intercurrent infection; the attack is not typical of the patient's prior attacks (if any); or the diagnosis of gout is not supported by prior urate crystal demonstration in a synovial fluid or tophus aspirate or by application of a &quot;diagnostic rule&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>] utilizing a set of clinical, historic, and laboratory criteria (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout#H678545251\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of a gout flare'</a>). In these circumstances, we perform arthrocentesis and synovial fluid analysis and culture, if feasible. We avoid oral (as well as intraarticular) glucocorticoid administration for flare mitigation until the results of these studies are available, but these conditions would not preclude initiation of antiinflammatory treatment with an NSAID or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>NSAIDs</strong> &ndash; A reasonable alternative to oral glucocorticoids is a potent oral NSAID, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> (500 mg twice daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> (50 mg three times daily). NSAIDs are a particularly appropriate alternative in younger patients (less than 60 years old) who lack renal, cardiovascular, or active gastrointestinal disease. Different NSAIDs appear comparably effective, and the ready availability of several NSAIDs without a prescription may favor their use in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H11842408\" class=\"local\">'NSAID therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Colchicine</strong> &ndash; Another reasonable alternative to glucocorticoids or NSAIDs is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, which is at least comparably effective to the other agents when taken within 24 hours of onset of an acute attack. Colchicine should be administered in a total dose on day 1 not to exceed 1.8 mg, either taken as 0.6 mg three times on the first day or by taking 1.2 mg for the first dose followed by 0.6 mg an hour later; on subsequent days colchicine is taken once or twice daily until flare resolution. In some countries, colchicine is available as a 0.5 mg rather than as a 0.6 mg pill. (See <a href=\"#H85444343\" class=\"local\">'Colchicine therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Colchicine</a> is a particularly convenient agent for patients already taking this medication for prophylaxis and for patients who have the drug available at home for use only at the onset of an acute flare. Colchicine should be avoided in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment and in patients on certain medications that may adversely interact with it. (See <a href=\"#H3146384137\" class=\"local\">'Administration of colchicine'</a> below and <a href=\"#H351173490\" class=\"local\">'Safety of colchicine'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Parenteral glucocorticoids</strong> &ndash; In patients with established gout who present with a typical flare limited to one or two joints, flare reduction can usually be accomplished with parenteral glucocorticoids:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Candidates for arthrocentesis and joint injection</strong> &ndash; Glucocorticoid intraarticular injection is an alternative to the use of orally administered glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> in patients with only one or two actively inflamed joints and whose clinical evaluation suggests a low risk for joint infection (see <a href=\"#H3581389594\" class=\"local\">'Intraarticular glucocorticoids'</a> below). Patients unable to take oral medications but otherwise fitting this clinical profile are also candidates for this approach, which requires ready access to a clinician with expertise in joint aspiration and injection. (See <a href=\"#H3581389594\" class=\"local\">'Intraarticular glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Not candidates for arthrocentesis and injection</strong> &ndash; In the rare patient with established gout, a flare affecting more than two joints (or joints inaccessible to injection), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unable to take oral medication, we suggest treatment with intravenous or intramuscular glucocorticoids. The choice of glucocorticoid and the route of administration depend upon the clinical context. (See <a href=\"#H1752774819\" class=\"local\">'Parenteral glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Concomitant anticoagulation therapy</strong> &ndash; In patients receiving anticoagulation, the treatment options include low-dose oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, which is most effective when taken within 24 hours of attack onset, and intraarticular, intravenous, or oral glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H17640260\" class=\"local\">'Patients on anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Persistent symptoms</strong> &ndash; The management of patients with persistent symptoms due to a confirmed acute flare of gout depends upon the prior therapy and upon patient comorbidities. Useful interventions include more prolonged treatment courses than usual, switching or combining agents, and the use of interleukin (IL)-1 inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Resistant disease or unable to take other therapies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12719329\" class=\"local\">'Investigational therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Despite widespread use in the treatment of acute gout attacks, the various classes of antiinflammatory agents had, until about 2002 to 2005, only infrequently been compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>] or with one another in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/4,7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,14</a>]. The results of efforts to obtain more evidence of the relative efficacy of these agents are reflected in the guidelines of the major professional groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>], which state that a glucocorticoid (given orally, by intraarticular injection, or parenterally), an oral NSAID, and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> in a low-dose regimen each have substantial efficacy in reducing or preventing full expression of the symptoms and signs of an acute gout flare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/15-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-26</a>].</p><p>Our approach to the patient with acute gout is based upon the available data and our clinical experience; this approach is generally consistent with that recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), the American College of Physicians (ACP), and the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/4-8,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3970600843\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530693919\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration and choice of glucocorticoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids are highly effective as rapidly acting antiinflammatory agents. The chosen route of administration depends upon several factors, including the number of involved joints, patient preference, the timely availability of the patient and the clinician, the experience of the clinician with joint injection techniques, and the need in some patients for parenteral rather than orally administered glucocorticoid therapy. Joint aspiration and injection are commonly used in rheumatology and orthopedic practice but, except for knee injection, are much less frequently done in primary care practice because of the experience required of the clinician and the need for direct patient-clinician interaction. For these reasons, as well as the generally favorable <span class=\"nowrap\">benefit/risk</span> profile of oral glucocorticoid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/22-24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24,26</a>], glucocorticoids are administered orally much more commonly in practice than by parenteral routes. (See <a href=\"#H599999754\" class=\"local\">'Oral glucocorticoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3581389594\" class=\"local\">'Intraarticular glucocorticoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1752774819\" class=\"local\">'Parenteral glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p>Glucocorticoids should be used with caution and close monitoring in patients with heart failure, poorly controlled hypertension, or glucose intolerance, but they may be used in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency.</p><p>Several randomized trials comparing oral glucocorticoid (or, in one case, intramuscular glucocorticoid) with NSAID therapy for acute gout flare indicate that glucocorticoids are at least as efficacious as NSAID therapy and may have fewer serious adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/22-24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24,26</a>]. Glucocorticoid treatment also offers routes of administration appropriate for some patients who are either not candidates for oral antiinflammatory drug therapy or who might benefit from intraarticular glucocorticoid therapy. For these reasons, as well as the ready availability and modest cost, glucocorticoid therapy is increasingly favored by most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], expert guideline panels for first-line gout flare treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H599999754\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest oral glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>) for most patients with acute gout flare, particularly for those who are not candidates for intraarticular glucocorticoid injection because of polyarticular disease or who do not have ready access to a clinician with expertise in arthrocentesis and injection. We use prednisone (or an equivalent glucocorticoid) in doses of 30 to 40 mg once daily or in two divided doses until flare resolution begins, and we then taper the dose of glucocorticoids, usually over 7 to 10 days.</p><p>Rebound attacks are relatively common once glucocorticoids are withdrawn, especially in patients who have previously suffered a number of prior attacks, whose intercritical periods have progressively shortened, and who are not receiving antiinflammatory flare prophylaxis; in these groups of patients, slower tapering of the glucocorticoid dose with extension of the duration of the taper to 10 to 14 or even 21 days is advisable.</p><p>In the rare patient who keeps flaring during oral glucocorticoid tapering, and in whom urate-lowering therapy has never been initiated, urate-lowering therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>) can often be successfully initiated with concomitant antiinflammatory treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Symptoms will usually resolve without therapy within a few days to several weeks but improve more quickly with administration of one of several classes of antiinflammatory drugs. More rapid and complete resolution of symptoms occurs the earlier that treatment is introduced. Initiation of treatment with urate-lowering pharmacotherapies is of no direct benefit in treating an acute gout flare, but ongoing urate-lowering therapy should not be interrupted in patients on such therapy at the time of an acute attack. (See <a href=\"#H11160517\" class=\"local\">'General therapeutic principles'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy and treatment of tophi in patients with gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of therapy for an acute gout flare depends upon an individual patient assessment of multiple factors, including patient age, comorbidities, and associated medical therapies; flare characteristics and past responses to therapy; the number of affected joints and their accessibility to arthrocentesis and injection; and patient and clinician preferences. (See <a href=\"#H85444272\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients who can take oral medications, we suggest oral glucocorticoids or NSAIDs for the treatment of acute gout flares. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Colchicine</a> is a safe and effective alternative for some patients. All three of these antiinflammatory agents are effective; the choice depends upon multiple individual factors (see <a href=\"#H425622375\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We use oral glucocorticoids in many patients, particularly for those who are not candidates for intraarticular glucocorticoid injection and those who have contraindications to use of NSAIDs: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, at an initial dose of 30 to 40 mg once daily or in a divided twice-daily dose until flare resolution begins, then we taper the dose, usually over 7 to 10 days. Because rebound flares occur more frequently with glucocorticoids than with alternative agents, especially among patients with multiple recent flares, we extend the course of glucocorticoid tapering to 14 to 21 days in such individuals. (See <a href=\"#H599999754\" class=\"local\">'Oral glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Other options (eg, NSAIDs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>) may be preferred in patients with concomitant infection, prior glucocorticoid intolerance, brittle diabetes, and those who are in a postoperative period in whom glucocorticoids may increase risk of impaired wound healing. NSAIDs or low-dose colchicine may also be preferred over glucocorticoids in patients with frequently recurrent attacks to avoid excessive total glucocorticoid dosing over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A reasonable alternative to oral glucocorticoids for an acute gout flare is a potent oral NSAID, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> (500 mg twice daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> (50 mg three times daily). NSAIDs are particularly appropriate in younger patients (less than 60 years old) who lack renal, cardiovascular, or active gastrointestinal disease. (See <a href=\"#H11842408\" class=\"local\">'NSAID therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">NSAIDs are most effective when treatment is initiated within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. The NSAID can be discontinued one or two days after clinical signs have completely resolved. Typically, the total duration of NSAID therapy for an acute attack is five to seven days. It is likely to be shorter in patients who are treated within the first 24 hours of symptom onset and may be longer in patients in whom treatment is not begun until several days later. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> is not used for the treatment of acute gout flares because of the paradoxical effects of salicylates on serum urate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Another reasonable alternative to glucocorticoids or NSAIDs is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, which is at least comparably effective to the other agents when taken within 24 hours of onset of an acute attack. Colchicine should be administered in a total dose on day 1 not to exceed 1.8 mg, either taken as 0.6 mg three times on the first day or by taking 1.2 mg for the first dose followed by 0.6 mg an hour later; most patients will not achieve complete resolution of pain within 24 hours but will respond further over several days of continued dosing at 0.6 mg once or twice daily, as tolerated, with reduction in the dose as the flare gradually resolves (at which time the acute flare treatment can be discontinued). In some countries, colchicine is available as a 0.5 mg rather than as a 0.6 mg pill. (See <a href=\"#H85444343\" class=\"local\">'Colchicine therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Colchicine</a> is a particularly convenient agent for patients already taking this medication for flare prophylaxis and for patients who have the drug available at home for use only at the onset of an acute flare. Patients already receiving colchicine gout flare prophylaxis should resume the prophylaxis dose after the first day of acute flare therapy. Particular attention should be given to avoidance of colchicine administration in patients with moderate to severe renal or hepatic disease receiving inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 system component CYP3A4 or inhibitors of the membrane P-glycoprotein multidrug resistance transporter (P-gp). (See <a href=\"#H85444343\" class=\"local\">'Colchicine therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H351173490\" class=\"local\">'Safety of colchicine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who are unable to take oral medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who have only one or two actively inflamed joints (and in whom infection has been excluded), we suggest arthrocentesis and intraarticular injection of glucocorticoids. We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide (40 mg for a large joint [eg, knee], 30 mg for a medium joint [eg, wrist, ankle, elbow], and 10 mg for a small joint) or equivalent doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> acetate. (See <a href=\"#H3581389594\" class=\"local\">'Intraarticular glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with polyarticular involvement who are unable to take oral medications, have existing or easily established intravenous access, and have no contraindications to glucocorticoids, we suggest systemic administration of an intravenous glucocorticoid. The dose and frequency depend upon the agent chosen. A typical dose is 20 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> twice daily, with stepwise reduction to half of each dose when improvement begins and with maintenance of at least 4 mg twice daily (or oral equivalent) for at least five days. For patients with no intravenous access, intramuscular glucocorticoids may be used. (See <a href=\"#H1752774819\" class=\"local\">'Parenteral glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are unresponsive to any other available approach and who have frequent recurrent attacks, an additional option is an interleukin (IL)-1 inhibitor, such as anakinra or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a>. The benefits of these agents for symptomatic relief need to be balanced with the potential for increased risk for serious infections. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Resistant disease or unable to take other therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who are anticoagulated, we use low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> or oral glucocorticoids. We use intraarticular glucocorticoids for the treatment of acute attacks if oral agents are contraindicated. We generally treat acute gout in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) or with end-stage renal disease requiring maintenance dialysis with intraarticular, oral, or systemic glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H17640260\" class=\"local\">'Patients on anticoagulation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H74454777\" class=\"local\">'End-stage renal disease and transplantation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gout-flares/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Neogi T.
