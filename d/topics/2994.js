CHH is sometimes also referred to as immunodeficiency with short-limbed dwarfism. It is caused by mutations in the ribonuclease mitochondrial RNA-processing (<em>RMRP</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Common features of the disorder include short stature, fine sparse hair, varying degrees of immunodeficiency, Hirschsprung disease (HD), and a susceptibility to hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Individuals with CHH have normal intelligence and achieve normal developmental milestones throughout childhood.</p><p>CHH is diagnosed clinically by observing fine and often sparse hair in an individual with short stature with disproportionally short limbs. Genetic analysis of the <em>RMRP</em> gene confirms the diagnosis. Immune-related complications (immunodeficiency, malignancy, and autoimmune disease) lead many to medical attention early in life and are a major cause of early mortality.</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of CHH. Other syndromic immunodeficiencies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromic-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromic immunodeficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CHH is a rare disorder in the general population but exists with greater prevalence among the Old Order Amish and Finnish populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, any person with short stature and immunodeficiency with Amish or Finnish inheritance should be evaluated for CHH.</p><p>One Finnish study estimated an incidence of 1:23,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The carrier frequency of a point mutation in the ribonuclease mitochondrial RNA-processing gene (<em>RMRP</em> 70 A&gt;G) is estimated to be as high as 1 in 19 among the Old Order Amish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The Old Order Amish are members of a larger Anabaptist group, which also included the Old Order Mennonites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The Anabaptists fled religious persecution in Europe and eventually immigrated to America in the late 1600s. Members of the Old Order Amish sect are widely distributed throughout the United States, but approximately 70 percent are concentrated in four counties: Lancaster County, Pennsylvania; Holmes and Geauga Counties of Ohio; and LaGrange County, Indiana.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CHH is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ribonuclease mitochondrial RNA-processing (<em>RMRP</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. This gene encodes for the untranslated (long noncoding [lnc]) RNA component of a mitochondrial RNA-processing endonuclease (RNase mitochondrial RNA processing [MRP]), a protein-RNA complex that plays a role in nucleolar processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), cleavage of mitochondrial RNA (mRNA) in mitochondrial DNA synthesis, and cleavage of cyclin B2 mRNA in cell cycle control.</p><p>The <em>RMRP</em> gene product functions as a nuclear reservoir for a group of lnc-RNAs with gene silencing activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Gene targets of lnc-RNAs include those with functions related to bone and cartilage growth. The <em>RMRP</em> gene product is also associated with a DDX5-RORyt complex with RNA-helicase function that regulates T helper cell type 17 (Th17) development and effector function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This mechanistic insight illuminates a role for RMRP in host defense and inflammation control.</p><p>The <em>RMRP</em> 70 A&gt;G mutation occurs in 30 to 48 percent of patients with CHH but is more common in the genetically isolated Amish and Finnish populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/1,4,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,10-12</a>]. Numerous other mutations in the <em>RMRP</em> promoter region and gene have been identified in patients with CHH.</p><p>Phenotypic heterogeneity is great, even among patients homozygous for the <em>RMRP</em> 70 A&gt;G mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/3,7,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,13,14</a>]. <em>RMRP</em> mutations that reduce rRNA cleavage are associated with bone dysplasia, whereas defects that decrease mRNA cleavage are associated with hair hypoplasia, immunodeficiency, and hematologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The degree of reduced rRNA or mRNA cleavage correlates with the degree of phenotypic severity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CHH is a diverse disorder with varied clinical manifestations. Originally thought to be achondroplasia, CHH was first described as a distinct clinical entity among the Old Order Amish of Pennsylvania by Victor McKusick [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Somatic growth and musculoskeletal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The musculoskeletal system is most consistently affected in CHH. Short stature and short limbs with increased carrying angle at the elbow are universally found in persons with CHH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77453\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77453 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63666\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63666 \">picture 2</a>). Increased lumbar lordosis, ligamentous laxity, and scoliosis are common and age dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/2,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16-18</a>].</p><p>Metaphyseal dysplasia, with scalloped, flared, and sclerotic metaphyses, most frequently affects the lower extremities. The degree of metaphyseal abnormality correlates with growth velocity and final height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>One detailed radiographic study of 82 patients with CHH showed that long bone growth was particularly abnormal and progressive in CHH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the same study, scoliosis was noted in 25 percent of patients overall and in 44 percent of adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Another series of 100 patients with CHH showed that relative limb growth rates declined rapidly in early childhood and the pubertal growth spurt was minimal to absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Appendicular skeletal growth was particularly abnormal, but axial skeletal dimensions were also affected among persons with CHH, indicating the global dysfunction of skeletal growth in this syndrome.</p><p>Analysis of the Finnish and Amish (unpublished observation) CHH cohorts showed that most individuals were short at birth but of normal weight for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Median adult heights were 131 cm (51.6 in) and 122.5 cm (48.2 in) for males and females, respectively, in the Finnish cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Growth velocity is generally normal for weight and length. However, most persons with CHH do not plot along &quot;normal&quot; percentiles. Head circumference is an exception in that normal measurements and growth velocity are the rule. Head measurements below the third percentile or those who do not follow a normal growth percentile should prompt further evaluations in a person with CHH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microcephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microcephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Postnatal evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Many individuals with CHH suffer arthralgias and progressive arthritis due to the metaphyseal abnormalities intrinsic to the disorder. However, the degree of metaphyseal abnormality does not appear to correlate with severity of symptomatic joint disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Some individuals benefit from joint replacement surgery or arthroscopy, although a comprehensive analysis of these interventions and their benefit for CHH is lacking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal anomalies in CHH range from classic Hirschsprung disease (HD), to long segment disease, to total colonic aganglionosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Enterocolitis is commonly associated with HD in the setting of CHH. It is a potentially lethal complication due to the severity of the inflammation and the risk of bacterial translocation into the bloodstream with subsequent sepsis in an individual with immunodeficiency. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Immunodeficiency'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hair abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal hair morphology is a hallmark of the CHH phenotype. Hair is fine but may vary in texture from patient to patient and even appear normal on gross inspection. However, hair shaft diameter in CHH is 50 to 67 percent smaller than normal hair when viewed under magnification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. CHH hair is more fragile than normal hair and weaker when subjected to tensile strength testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, amino acid analysis reveals no difference in sulfur-containing amino acid composition compared with controls (disulfide bonds and sulfhydryl groups are major components of keratin in hair).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunodeficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impairment of immune function is the greatest health risk among persons with CHH and represents the most common cause of premature death in this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. All persons with CHH are at risk for severe, frequent, and unusual infections irrespective of their laboratory findings.</p><p>Various host defense abnormalities are described in persons with CHH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/3,17,26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17,26-32</a>]. Cell-mediated immunodeficiency (combined immunodeficiency) is most commonly reported. In a series of 108 patients with CHH from Finland, 88 percent of patients had in vitro evidence of abnormal cellular immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. More than one-half had an increased susceptibility to infection, and 6 percent died of primary infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=combined-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Combined immunodeficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fatal varicella infection has been described in a number of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, many individuals from the Amish cohort have developed native immunity to varicella without serious sequelae. Patients may develop infections with organisms that signify a severe T cell defect, such a <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em> (<em>P. jirovecii</em>) pneumonia, cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, or severe oropharyngeal candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is known to occur in the setting of CHH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. SCID may present in classic fashion with alymphocytosis and severe humoral defects, with severe T and B cell functional defects, but quantifiable cell counts, or with an Omenn syndrome phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/3,7,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-specific-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): Specific defects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sinopulmonary infections suggestive of humoral immune deficiency are also common in CHH. In the Finnish cohort, 35 percent (7 of 20) of patients prospectively evaluated had defective humoral immunity, most frequently immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency. Some individuals have hypogammaglobulinemia requiring immunoglobulin replacement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-humoral-immunodeficiencies-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary humoral immunodeficiencies: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Discrimination between severe and more moderate forms of immunodeficiency in CHH is difficult and often not discernible with routine laboratory methods. However, individuals with CHH who have severe lymphopenia and immunoglobulin defects should be considered as high risk for infection susceptibility. An additional confounding feature of CHH is that many patients with lymphopenia do not suffer recurrent infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mortality in CHH is increased primarily owing to greater infection susceptibility in children and a higher incidence of hematologic malignancy among adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/25,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,37,38</a>]. Extended follow-up of a Finnish cohort of 123 patients revealed 14 cases of cancer, with an expected incidence of two based upon population-based data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Half of the malignancies were of B cell origin. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma was most common (n = 9), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (n = 3), leukemia (n = 1), and Hodgkin's disease (n = 1). Nine of the 14 cases occurred in patients between the ages of 15 and 44 years. Multiple malignancies have also been reported in CHH patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/28,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with CHH also display a unique predisposition to the development of basal cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/28,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,38</a>]. In the same Finnish cohort described above, an additional 10 patients had basal cell carcinoma of the skin, with an expected number of 0.3 cases for the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Patients with bronchiectasis more often have a humoral immunodeficiency and worse growth failure.

All four patients had infiltrative skin lesions, and one also had visceral organ involvement. One patient had spontaneous resolution of granulomas at 17 years of age. The other three patients had partial regression of lesions with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy in addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. However, one of these patients died from viral progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The granulomatous inflammation resolved completely in another of these patients after undergoing successful hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Other features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dramatic clinical heterogeneity is observed within CHH sibships. This phenotype diversity within families makes presymptomatic diagnosis of immunodeficiency challenging, even when a previous sibling had immune problems. Similar findings are noted in other populations with different ribonuclease mitochondrial RNA-processing (<em>RMRP</em>) mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all persons with CHH will have some abnormal immune studies. However, there is not a clear pattern of immunodeficiency among people with CHH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/3,14,23,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,23,42-44</a>]. Absolute lymphocyte counts and T cell counts for age are generally low, delayed-type hypersensitivity responses are often impaired, and neutropenia is also reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens is generally suboptimal compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, abnormal in vitro proliferation and lymphopenia do not necessarily indicate that a given individual will have a severe immunodeficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antibody defects are also common in CHH persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/3,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,45</a>]. Hypogammaglobulinemia may be transient or persist throughout life. Selective immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency is described in some individuals and may be a marker for severe immunodeficiency in CHH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. An individual with more than one immunoglobulin isotype deficiency should be considered high risk for infectious complications. Humoral immune defects may occur alone or in combination with cellular defects. In the latter case, the provisional diagnosis is severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) until proven otherwise.

Surveillance for immunodeficiency, malignancy, and autoimmune disease is important for all people with CHH and should be part of every clinical visit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2842801767\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants should be evaluated for immunodeficiency and have close surveillance for infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50065\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50065 \">algorithm 1</a>). Administration of live, attenuated vaccines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F112956\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112956 \">table 1</a>) is <strong>not</strong> recommended without first demonstrating normal T cell responses. However, lymphocyte subset values and other immunologic parameters for age (such as lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens and antigens, specific immunoglobulin G [IgG] titers, and quantitative immunoglobulins) are typically abnormally low in patients with CHH, even in those not subsequently identified with an immunodeficiency.</p><p>It is the author&rsquo;s opinion that clear cutoff values cannot reliably distinguish the immunocompetent individual with CHH within the first six months of life, although patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) can be identified. Live vaccines should <strong>not</strong> be administered to patients with suspected SCID. The author follows all infants with CHH and no evidence of SCID until at least one year of age to confirm that there is no clear evidence of a combined immunodeficiency or T cell dysfunction (ie, the patient is immunocompetent) before administering live, attenuated virus vaccines. Other routine vaccinations are recommended for individuals with CHH according to the standard schedule.

HCT is curative for SCID in the setting of CHH, and associated autoimmunity also resolves after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/3,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,49-51</a>]. However, HCT does not improve the musculoskeletal or growth features of the syndrome. Risk stratification for serious immunodeficiency is difficult unless the patient has alymphocytosis and classic SCID presentation. Thus, determining who will benefit from HCT is not always clear. Transplantation before the development of serious infections, significant organ damage, or malignancy improves survival for those patients who clearly have combined immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Hirschsprung disease (HD) is common in CHH. Some patients with CHH present outside of the newborn period with only mild constipation, with the diagnosis of HD established near six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Any bloody stools in an infant with CHH should prompt an evaluation for HD and associated enterocolitis because enterocolitis may be the heralding sign of HD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Growth monitoring in CHH is essential. CHH specific growth charts are not readily available, but monitoring with standard growth charts is still useful to ensure steady progress. Delayed or diminished head growth is not typical in CHH and warrants further evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microcephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microcephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Postnatal evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal growth patterns in infants and prepubertal children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of growth'</a>.)</p><p>Because adults may present with severe bronchiectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], we recommend routine surveillance for obstructive lung disease with periodic spirometry <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary function testing. Any chronic pulmonary infections or significant abnormalities of pulmonary function warrant further investigation with computed tomography (CT) of the chest.</p><p>Surveillance for musculoskeletal disease, such as scoliosis, symptomatic genu and ankle varus, and arthritides later in life, should be part of routine evaluations of CHH patients. Surgical correction may be needed for symptomatic scoliosis or large joint arthritis.

Lifespan can be shortened in patients with CHH secondary to a significant immunodeficiency in childhood or lymphoma and leukemia in adulthood. Severe bronchiectasis may also dramatically shorten lifespan of persons with CHH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Analysis of 120 Finnish CHH patients between 1971 and 1995 revealed a standardized mortality ratio (SMR, the ratio of observed to expected deaths) of 380 for infectious complications in childhood (less than age 14 years) and an SMR of 52 for hematologic malignancies among persons older than 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cartilage-hair-hypoplasia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].
