It is also called a &quot;D and C&quot; or &quot;D&amp;C.&quot;</p><p>During a D and C, a doctor first opens (dilates) the cervix (this is the bottom part or the &quot;neck&quot; of the uterus). Then he or she puts a surgical tool called a &quot;curette&quot; through the vagina and cervix, and up into the uterus. He or she uses the curette to scrape and remove tissue from the uterus.</p><p>A D and C is done in an operating room in a hospital or clinic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31710067\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my doctor do a D and C?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might do a D and C to figure out the cause of a symptom or problem. During a D and C, a doctor gets a sample of tissue from your uterus that can be checked for abnormal cells, cancer, or other problems.</p><p>Women might have a D and C:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To figure out why they have abnormal bleeding from their uterus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If they had an abnormal result from another test, such as a test for uterine cancer</p><p/><p>Doctors can also do a D and C to treat a medical problem or condition. In pregnant or recently pregnant women, a doctor can do a D and C to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove any pregnancy tissue that is left in the uterus after a miscarriage &ndash; A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the baby can live outside the womb.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove any pregnancy tissue that is left in the uterus after a birth</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove an abnormal growth called a &quot;molar pregnancy&quot; that has formed in the uterus of a pregnant woman</p><p/><p>In women who are not pregnant, a doctor can do a D and C to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop severe vaginal bleeding. For example, a woman might have a D and C if her period is too heavy or if she keeps bleeding too much after giving birth.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31710074\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do before a D and C?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will give you instructions about what to do before a D and C. He or she will probably tell you not to eat or drink anything starting the night before the procedure.</p><p>Your doctor might give you a device or a medicine to put inside your vagina near your cervix the day before your D and C. The device or medicine can soften the cervix or start to dilate it. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any trouble getting ready for your D and C.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31710081\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during a D and C?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will have thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV,&quot; put in your arm or hand. Your doctor or nurse will give you fluids and medicines through the IV. Some of these medicines will make you feel relaxed, sleepy, or numb during the procedure.</p><p>When a doctor does a D and C to find out why a woman is having symptoms, he or she might do another test called a hysteroscopy at the same time. During a hysteroscopy, a doctor puts a small camera inside the uterus to look for problems that could be causing the symptoms. If a woman has a growth in her uterus, a doctor might do a procedure during the D and C to remove it.</p><p>When a doctor does a D and C to treat a problem or condition, he or she will remove everything inside the uterus. He or she might also scrape away some of the lining of the uterus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31710088\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after a D and C?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a D and C, your doctor or nurse will watch you for a few hours to make sure you don't have any problems. Another person should drive you home from the hospital.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will tell you when you can do your usual activities again. He or she will also tell you when you can have sex and put things, such as tampons, in your vagina.</p><p>Most women get their monthly period within 4 to 6 weeks after a D and C.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31710095\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the side effects of a D and C?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effects are mild cramping and slight bleeding from the vagina (called spotting). These can last for a few days. If you have pain, you can take a pain-reliever.</p><p>Other side effects are not as common but can occur after a D and C. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tear in the uterus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury to the cervix</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Areas of scar tissue that form in the uterus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31710102\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if you have any of the following problems after your D and C:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cramps that last more than 2 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain that gets worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavy vaginal bleeding, or vaginal bleeding that lasts more than 2 weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal discharge that is green or smells bad</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31710109\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=miscarriage-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Miscarriage (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abortion-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Abortion (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heavy-periods-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heavy periods (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-ablation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Endometrial ablation (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilation-and-curettage-d-and-c-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dilation and curettage (D and C) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Abnormal uterine bleeding (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=miscarriage-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Miscarriage (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
