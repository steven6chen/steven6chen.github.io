Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP) are diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, of which IPF is the most common type of fibrotic lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>The histopathologic pattern associated with the clinical diagnosis of IPF is referred to as &quot;usual interstitial pneumonia&quot; (UIP). UIP can also be seen in other fibrotic lung diseases associated with connective tissue disorders, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and asbestosis.

Fibroblast foci are clusters of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts that lie in continuity with the established fibrosis and are a characteristic histologic feature of UIP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58242 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/1,3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-6</a>]. These abnormalities are typically associated with a mild, patchy chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate.</p><p>The end result of the fibrotic process is a complex reticulum that is highly interconnected and extends from pleura into the underlying parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71960\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71960 \">image 1</a>). The pathology of UIP in comparison with other interstitial pneumonias is discussed in greater detail separately.

Unfortunately, animal models of lung fibrosis do not translate perfectly to human IPF because most animal models have a prominent inflammatory cellular component as a tissue response to injury. By comparison, usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which is the characteristic histological pattern of human IPF, lacks inflammatory cells in the fibrotic lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Subepithelial fibroblast foci, the histological hallmark of UIP, are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58242 \">picture 1</a>) absent in most animal models of pulmonary fibrosis. Nevertheless, there are sufficient similarities between some animal models and human disease to be able to develop a number of insights and hypotheses about IPF pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The precise factors that initiate the histopathologic processes observed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are unknown. Certain risk factors are associated with IPF, including cigarette smoking, viral infection, environmental pollutants, chronic aspiration, genetic predisposition, and drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, none of these risk factors adequately explains the extensive remodeling and progressive nature of IPF, or the increase in incidence of fibrosis with advancing age.</p><p>It is possible that nonspecific injury to the epithelial barrier and pulmonary parenchyma, such as might be inflicted by these risk factors, initiates the disease process of IPF in susceptible individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic predisposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A genetic predisposition to pulmonary fibrosis is suggested by reports of families with several affected members (familial pulmonary fibrosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/3,10,12-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,12-25</a>]. However, the precise genetic and host susceptibility factor(s) that determine the phenotypic expression and clinical manifestations of sporadic IPF remain unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Investigations have identified several gene mutations that may play a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/16-24,26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-24,26-30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in surfactant proteins A2 (SP-A2) and C (SFTPC) have been identified in several families with IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Mutations in the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette A3 (<em>ABCA3</em>) gene may affect the course of SFTPC-related IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A genome-wide linkage scan identified a risk locus for IPF on chromosome 11, and further fine mapping of that locus found a common variant in the promoter of the gene encoding mucin 5B (<em>MUC5B</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This variant was present in 34 percent of subjects with familial pulmonary fibrosis, 38 percent of those with IPF, and 9 percent of controls. In a separate study, a <em>MUC5B</em> promotor single nucleotide polymorphism was significantly associated with IPF, but not lung fibrosis in sarcoidosis or systemic sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Furthermore, this same genetic variant is associated with interstitial lung abnormalities on chest computed tomography (CT) in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. MUC5B expression in lung tissue is 14 times higher in subjects with IPF, compared with unaffected subjects. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telomerase gene (eg, <em>TERT, TERC, DKC1, TINF2</em>) mutations, which cause shortened telomeres, have been identified in about 25 percent of sporadic IPF and in about 15 percent of families with familial pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/21-25,27,31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25,27,31-34</a>]. However, the relationship between IPF, telomerase activity, and telomere length appears complex. Patients with sporadic IPF and telomere shortening do not necessarily have mutations in the telomerase genes, and telomerase activity is induced in a greater proportion of lung fibroblasts from patients with IPF than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

In addition, the study identified seven new association loci <em>FAM13A</em> (4q22), <em>DSP</em> (6p24), <em>OBFC1</em> (10q24), <em>ATP11A</em> (13q34), <em>DPP9</em> (19p13), and chromosomal regions 7q22 and 15q14-15. An additional GWAS comparing subjects with IPF to healthy controls identified additional novel variants in <em>TOLLIP</em> and <em>SPPL2C</em> associated with disease susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. While <em>TOLLIP</em> sits in close proximity to <em>MUC5B</em> on chromosome 11p, the association appears independent as these alleles were not frequently inherited together based on linkage disequilibrium. Thus, genes involved in host defense, cell-cell adhesion, and DNA repair appear to contribute to the risk of developing fibrotic interstitial lung disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 25 kindreds of familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP), nine loss-of-function, rare variants were identified in the gene that encodes the regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. RTEL1 is a DNA helicase that regulates telomere replication and stability. The rare variants identified in this study segregate with FIP and are associated with very short telomeres in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In 163 additional FIP kindreds, heterozygous variants of RTEL1 were found in eight families (approximately 5 percent). These observations further support the role of genes affecting telomeres in FIP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relationship between genetic variants associated with disease susceptibility versus disease progression is complex. While the <em>MUC5B</em> promoter polymorphism is associated with risk for disease, it is also associated with survival in IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Additionally, the protective <em>TOLLIP</em> single nucleotide polymorphism for disease development is associated with increased mortality from IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Not identified as a risk allele for disease susceptibility, a genetic polymorphism in <em>TLR3</em> has been associated with disease progression in IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It was previously postulated that inflammation preceded fibrosis in IPF, based upon the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In animal models, inflammation precedes the development of a fibrotic response, and suppression of the inflammatory alveolitis attenuates the subsequent fibrotic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologically, the alveolitis of early pulmonary fibrosis in animal models is dominated by inflammatory cells, including alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. Increased numbers of basophils and mast cells also have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Presumably, an inflammatory phase preceded the fibrotic phase.</p><p/><p>The alveolar macrophage was proposed to play a pivotal role in the genesis of IPF due to its ability to secrete proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines that affect mesenchymal cell proliferation and promote collagen deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>].</p><p>The above postulate that lung inflammation is necessary and sufficient to produce fibrosis in IPF has been questioned for several reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation is generally minimal in patients with IPF, and there is no evidence that patients with early disease have more prominent inflammatory changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrosis can be induced in laboratory animals in the absence of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiinflammatory therapy with systemic glucocorticoids has failed to alter the natural history of IPF.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibroblast and epithelial cell dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another theory is that IPF results from aberrant fibroblast and epithelial cell function and abnormal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions with little or no inflammatory component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This view is supported by the presence of fibrotic foci in areas of disrupted basement membrane directly beneath areas of damaged epithelium without the presence of a significant inflammatory cell infiltrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Initiation and perpetuation of this fibrotic response may depend upon genetic factors, environmental triggers, and imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants; imbalance of Th1 and Th2 cell-derived cytokines may also be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of fibrosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PERPETUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A critical element in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the unremitting fibrotic response; many patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IPF/usual</span> interstitial pneumonia (UIP) have moderate to advanced fibrotic disease at the time of diagnosis without histologic evidence of cellular inflammation in the pulmonary parenchyma. This differs from inflammatory pulmonary conditions such as bacterial pneumonia, in which massive pulmonary inflammation is followed by recovery with minimal long-term effects on lung structure and function. The stimulus that promotes pulmonary fibrosis instead of repair is unknown. If inflammation is an essential component of IPF, the mechanisms involved in the clearance of acute inflammation may be impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/47,48,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48,50</a>].</p><p>In some animal models of pulmonary fibrosis, inflammation is followed by recovery, and fibrosis does not progress. For example, following intratracheal instillation of the fifth component of complement, there is a massive influx of neutrophils and monocytes within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Similarly, intratracheal instillation of the anti-neoplastic antibiotic, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, leads to an initial injury to the alveolar epithelium and an influx of activated macrophages and neutrophils into alveoli that resolves in two to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/48,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50,51</a>]. However, monocytes persist in alveolar walls up to eight weeks after exposure, at which time the histology is predominantly fibrotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another characteristic feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is that the fibrotic process is progressive. Once initiated at the epithelial barrier of the alveoli, the injury to epithelial cells and basement membrane results in complex cell and cytokine interactions that extend the fibrotic process to involve the alveolar walls, alveolar lumen, and then adjacent areas of lung parenchyma.</p><p>An early consequence of injury to the epithelium is development of an intraalveolar exudate. Organization of the intraalveolar exudate leads to alveolar collapse with apposition of the denuded alveolar walls and loss of surfactant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Both epithelial and basement membrane injury appear necessary for the development of intraluminal fibrosis. In the normal lung, the alveolar epithelium is comprised predominantly of type I epithelial cells, with a relatively small number of type II epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Following injury, type II cells proliferate and differentiate into type I cells, and are normally responsible for reepithelialization of injured alveoli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>In IPF, loss of epithelial type I cells and marked proliferation of epithelial type II cells are noted; however, these cells do not appear to reepithelialize the alveolar space in IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. This may be due to continued abnormalities of the basement membrane, which has microscopic alterations including duplication and fragmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. These basement membrane abnormalities in turn permit the migration of mesenchymal cells from the interstitium to the alveolar regions of the injured lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Excessive deposition of collagen by mesenchymal cells appears to prevent reexpansion of the collapsed airspace. The pattern of these changes suggests that chronic or recurrent injury to the alveolar epithelium may result in the progressive nature of intraalveolar exudates, fibrosis, and remodeling. </p><p>It is also possible that an initial injury and release of cytokines leads to long lasting effects on fibroblasts. For example, in an experimental model of IPF the release of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) from alveolar epithelial cells for 4 days led to induction of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, which was sequestered in the fibroblast matrix and led to an altered fibroblast phenotype with continued proliferation long after the exposure to TGF-beta1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>In patients with IPF, serum concentrations of lung surfactant proteins (SP-A and SP-D) and Kerbs von Lungren 6 antigen (KL-6) are increased, and changes in serum concentration of KL-6 may be a marker for disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2), which promotes collagen cross-linking, is detectable in serum from IPF patients and is associated with disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF FIBROSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of fibrosis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains elusive; however, a number of likely contributors have been identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64611\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64611 \">figure 1</a>). It is possible that multiple microinjuries to alveolar epithelial cells induce a fibrotic environment, and that growth factors secreted by the injured epithelial cells recruit fibroblasts that differentiate into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are cells that express features of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, and are identified by their expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. After being recruited to the lungs or differentiated from resident fibroblasts, myofibroblasts secrete collagen, which accumulates due to imbalance between interstitial collagenases and their tissue inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>While recurrent microinjuries to the alveolar wall and distal airways seem to be necessary for the initiation of fibrosis, specific extrinsic factors that might contribute to epithelial injury have not been identified. Since 90 percent of patients with IPF have physiologically detectable gastroesophageal reflux, often in the absence of symptoms, it is conceivable that microaspiration of acid into the distal lungs could be one cause of recurrent insults to epithelial barrier, altered epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and subsequent fibrosis in genetically predisposed individuals. Further studies are required to determine if a causal relationship exists between gastroesophageal reflux and IPF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Altered reepithelialization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A considerable body of evidence suggests a critical role for alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) in the pathogenesis of IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/45,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,60</a>]. Electron microscope studies demonstrate that resident mesenchymal cells are located in the space between the alveolar epithelium and the capillary endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The close proximity of mesenchymal cells to epithelial cells may contribute to the regulation of cell proliferation and connective tissue synthesis by fibrogenic cytokines released from epithelial cells. The current hypothesis suggests that repeated subclinical injury to the lung injures the alveolar epithelial, the subepithelial, and adjacent endothelial basement membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This injury permits entry into the alveoli of cells of the mesenchymal lineage, and also other cells and cytokines. Eventually, based on a complex integrated process that is poorly understood, there is the emergence of a phenotype of fibroblasts that are highly, active, proliferative and contractile.</p><p>In IPF, there is loss of type I epithelial cells and proliferation of type II cells; orderly reepithelialization followed by differentiation of the type II cells to type I AECs does not occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. This lack of normal reepithelialization may, in part, be due to an aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway following to lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The Wnt proteins inhibit phosphorylation of beta-catenin by glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b), and prevent its translocation to nucleus and activation of the lymphoid enhancing <span class=\"nowrap\">factor/T-cell</span> factor <span class=\"nowrap\">(LEF/TCF)</span> transcription factors; this is believed to activate proliferation of type II cells and inhibit their differentiation, with eventual triggering of divergent epithelial regeneration at bronchoalveolar junctions and possibly leading to epithelial-mesenchymal transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Another possible abnormality of the alveolar epithelium in IPF patients is impaired regenerative capacity of the epithelium. In some IPF patients the impaired regeneration could be genetic or age related. For example, in a cohort of familial IPF patients there is dysfunctional telomerase shortening, which may lead to cellular senescence and poor reepithelialization, either after an injury or after natural cell turn-over. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Genetic predisposition'</a> above.) It then follows that IPF patients maybe a subset of genetically susceptible individuals, in whom epithelial regeneration may become impaired with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. This speculation fits with observation of increase in incidence and prevalence of IPF with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Another well recognized aberrancy of the AEC in IPF patients may be the overproduction and release of fibrogenic cytokines and growth factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokines, growth factors, and other molecules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the exact nature of the initiating injury and the subsequent cascade of mechanistic events needs to be elucidated, it is now clear that the interaction of growth factors, cytokines, and other mediators with cells resident in the lung is important to the evolution of the fibrotic response in IPF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64611\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64611 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-67</a>]. Resident epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells within the lung produce an array of cytokines and growth factors that stimulate fibroblast proliferation and matrix synthesis. Following epithelial injury, fibrosis is believed to progress due to an imbalance between many groups of molecules that include proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines, fibrogenic and antifibrogenic polypeptides, oxidants-antioxidants, and angiogenic and angiostatic molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/65,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,68</a>].</p><p>Unlike bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from normal controls, BAL from patients with IPF contains increased amounts of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), including the active form TGF-beta1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. TGF-beta1 is one of the most potent regulators of connective tissue synthesis due to its ability to increase connective tissue synthesis, down-regulate connective tissue proteases, and increase the inhibitors of connective tissue proteases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/69,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,71</a>]. TGF-beta1 can also induce a number of growth factors and cytokines that participate in fibrosis, including connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and interleukins (ILs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/65,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,72</a>]. The role of TGF-beta in IPF is supported by inhibition of fibrosis in experimental animals by reducing its expression, signaling, and activity.</p><p>CTGF is a downstream mediator of TGF-beta1; it influences connective tissue synthesis by fibroblasts and functions as a mitogen for cells independently or in association with other mediators. CTGF expression is increased in BAL of patients with IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].</p><p>Another cytokine implicated in IPF is tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha expression is increased in IPF, but its specific role is not clear. TNF-alpha has the ability to increase production of TGF-beta1 and other peptide mediators, stimulate fibroblast proliferation, and induce collagen synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. In mice with established fibrosis, TNF-alpha reduced the fibrotic burden and improved lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Among individuals with TNF-alpha gene polymorphisms, there is an increased risk of developing IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>In contrast, expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), an inhibitor of fibroblast proliferation and connective tissue synthesis, appears to be deficient in lungs from patients with IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/78-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-81</a>]. IFN-gamma also suppresses the Th2-type inflammatory response. While these observations suggested a potential therapeutic role for IFN-gamma, treatment with subcutaneous humanized interferon gamma-1b did not reduce mortality among patients with IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>In IPF, there is also an overexpression of fibrotic cytokines. The putative role of chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) in the recruitment of IPF cells is becoming increasingly recognized. TGF-beta, CTGF, IL-4, IL-13, FGF-2, IGF-1, PDGF and GM-CSF are fibrogenic and IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17 are anti-fibrogenic molecules. Evolution of fibrosis appears to involve the activator protein (AP)-1 transcription factor and the fos-related protein Fra-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>Additional proteins that may contribute to pathogenesis or reflect disease activity of IPF have been identified using gene expression profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/84-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-89</a>]. As an example, genes over expressed in lung tissue and blood from patients with IPF include matrix metalloprotein (MMP)-7, MMP-1, surfactant protein A1, cyclin A2 (CCNA2), and alpha-defensins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-88</a>]. Comparing gene expression profiles from IPF lungs with profiles of genes associated with lung development may provide insight into the pathogenic mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. Furthermore, a signature of increased MMP-7 and MMP-1 has been noted in the peripheral blood of patients with IPF and levels of these proteins may correlate with disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibrotic foci</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrotic foci are now recognized as the characteristic histological feature of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58242 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. Following the induction of fibroblast activity by epithelial injury, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts appear to organize into fibrotic foci that precede the appearance of end-stage fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These fibroblast foci are situated adjacent to sites of epithelial cell and basement membrane damage, and consist of aggregates of actively proliferating fibroblasts and myofibroblasts.</p><p>The persistence of fibroblasts and formation of fibroblast foci may be regulated by inhibition of apoptosis of fibroblasts. For example, IL-4 has been shown to induce macrophage derived insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and inhibit IPF fibroblast apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. In another study, pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a 50 kDa protein, was expressed in fibroblasts of IPF lungs, indicating its possible role in apoptosis and maintenance of fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. These cells also express different intermediate filaments than fibroblasts; however, the pattern of expression varies in different tissues and under different pathological conditions.</p><p>Fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts under the influence of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), which results in expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (SMA), increased collagen production, and decreased synthesis of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/92-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">92-94</a>]. Fibrotic foci can be identified by the presence of proliferating myofibroblasts that are actively synthesizing collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/3,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,92</a>].</p><p>Soluble mediators secreted by alveolar epithelial cells and other cells in the surrounding milieu are believed to induce leukocyte influx, stimulate fibroblast activity, and promote fibrosis. Important among these are TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-8. TGF-beta is produced by activated epithelial cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells, and is the most crucial mediator in the development of pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/69,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,71</a>]. It is elevated both in patients with IPF and following intratracheal instillation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> in the murine model of IPF. In addition, fibrosis is attenuated by the inhibition of TGF-beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>]. Specific polymorphisms of the gene encoding TGF-beta appear to increase the risk of disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Mesenchymal cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mesenchymal cell population at the site of fibrotic foci (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58242 \">picture 1</a>) includes fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and undifferentiated cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fibroblasts at these foci could be derived from four sources: interstitial peribronchiolar and perivascular adventitial fibroblasts, epithelial cells, circulating fibrocytes, and bone marrow-derived marrow stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

As an example, one study found that IPF lungs demonstrated a 1.8-fold increase in the proportion of parenchymal cells that were mesenchymal in origin, and that these cells proliferated at a faster rate in the IPF lung than in the normal lung. These alterations were most pronounced in the fibroblast populations with altered phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/90,92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,92,93</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibroblast subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IPF is characterized by fibroblast subpopulations that differ in their behavior when compared to fibroblasts isolated from normal lungs.

Whether these differences occur as a primary phenomenon, or are secondary to prolonged exposure to an inflammatory milieu, is presently unclear. It appears that these changes are important in transforming the fibroblast from a relatively passive cell into an important factor in the pathogenesis of IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

In contrast, the receptor for the C1q-collagen domain is produced largely by the LF fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. These studies support the belief that lung fibroblast subtypes have varying rates of proliferation and collagen synthesis, and that these population differences may have relevance to the pathogenesis of fibroproliferative lung disease in general.</p><p>More definitive evidence that fibroblast subtypes can be identified at the gene level was obtained by the isolation of mRNA, which is expressed at high levels in HF fibroblasts, and only marginally in LF cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].

Circulating fibrocytes are believed to bind to CCR7 and CXCR4 receptors in injured lung tissue under the influence of chemokines CCL21 and CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12). When cultured, the fibrocytes express connective tissue proteins and can differentiate into myofibroblasts, suggesting that fibrocytes could differentiate into myofibroblasts in IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/110,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,111</a>].</p><p>Evidence for potential involvement of circulating fibrocytes in IPF includes induction of chemokines CCL21 and CXCL12 in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].

One type of mesenchymal cell was located within areas of active fibrosis and demonstrated expression of alpha-SMA, desmin, and procollagen mRNA. The other was predominantly localized within fibrotic submesothelial areas, and expressed only SMA and procollagen mRNA. Using colocalization of SMA and procollagen alpha1(I) mRNA expression, lung myofibroblasts were found to be responsible for the vast majority of collagen synthesis. A similar conclusion regarding the major role of the myofibroblast in collagen accumulation in human fibrotic lung disease was drawn from immunohistochemical analysis of lung biopsy specimens from patients with IPF, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (also known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. </p><p>In a bleomycin-fibrosis model, overexpression of the gene hyaluronan synthase (produces the extracellular matrix component hyaluronan) and its cognate receptor CD44 promoted the conversion of myofibroblasts into an aggressive and invasive phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p>The contractile property of myofibroblasts has been demonstrated in vitro using strips of fibrotic lung that contract in response to epinephrine and other agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. In addition, the increased proportion of myofibroblast-like cells correlated with greater contractile properties when cultured on collagen gels. Of note, the cells isolated from bleomycin-treated lung also expressed more mRNA for TGF-beta1, and reverted to the phenotype isolated from normal lung when treated with anti-TGF-beta antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. As mentioned above, TGF-beta plays a significant role in the proliferation of the myofibroblast phenotype since it induces expression of SMA in lung fibroblasts in culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. A temporal in vivo correlation also has been described between epithelial type II cell TGF-beta 1 expression and SMA expression in lung mesenchymal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p>Using microRNA arrays on IPF lungs some interesting observations have been made. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules that contain approximately 22 nucleotides and function to inhibit or promote the degradation of specific target mRNAs. Aberrant expression of the microRNA family miR-21 has been demonstrated in myofibroblasts from IPF lungs, but not from normal controls. The miR-21 has been shown to function like an oncogene and in this manner prevents myofibroblast senescence and promotes proliferation and differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. In contrast to miR-21, there is diminished expression of miR-29, which inhibits fibrogenic proteins; the diminished expression of miR-29 in IPF lung fibroblasts may result in excessive connective tissue synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. Other microRNAs with pro-fibrotic function (miR-145, miR-154, miR-199a-5p) or anti-fibrotic effects (miR-326, miR-17~92) are differentially expressed in IPF lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/130-134\" class=\"abstract_t\">130-134</a>]. Taken together these observations suggest that aberrant post-transcriptional gene regulation in fibroblasts of IPF patients may result in a unique phenotype of fibroblasts that proliferate excessively and synthesize connective tissue proteins without control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">COLLAGEN DEPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), excess collagen is produced by myofibroblasts and deposited in a disorganized manner within the extracellular matrix.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal lungs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Collagen is the predominant type of protein in the extracellular matrix of the lung, constituting 20 percent of the dry weight of normal lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>].

Following DNA transcription, collagen mRNA is translated into procollagen alpha chains, which are then modified by the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues. The pro-alpha chains are subsequently glycosylated and disulfide bonds formed, and then the chains are assembled into the triple helix characteristic of mature collagen. Finally, these collagen molecules are proteolytically cleaved to form fibrillar collagens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>].</p><p>In normal lungs, collagen is produced and degraded continuously; this process is tightly regulated to preserve the normal lung structure. Lung fibroblasts synthesize type I and II collagens and may degrade as much as 40 percent of all newly synthesized collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/139,140\" class=\"abstract_t\">139,140</a>]. The initial degradation process is accomplished intracellularly, and may take less than 15 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>].</p><p>Collagen is also degraded extracellularly by a family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that includes collagenases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>].

These fibroblasts, found in clusters, form the characteristic fibrotic foci located in the subepithelial areas of injured lung. These foci are surrounded by residual areas of basal lamina, indicating that they are located on the airspace side of the injured alveoli. In lungs of patients with IPF, but not in normal controls, these sites contain fibroblasts synthesizing collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>].</p><p>Conflicting data have been obtained regarding the source of increased collagen deposition in pulmonary fibrosis. Increased numbers of collagen-synthesizing cells and increased collagen production have been noted in lung biopsies from patients with IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. However, fibroblasts isolated from the lungs of patients with IPF and systemic sclerosis were found to synthesize a similar amount of collagen compared with control cell lines, although the rate of collagen degradation was less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/145,146\" class=\"abstract_t\">145,146</a>]. Observations evaluating the expression of collagen type I and procollagen type I mRNA using in situ hybridization have helped to reconcile these observations, demonstrating increased expression of type I collagen within fibroblast foci, without evidence of increased type I procollagen mRNA expression in other areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Therefore, it appears that the widely variable collagen secretion observed in IPF could be due to a focal, rather than a generalized, increase in fibroblast activation.</p><p>In addition to increased synthesis and deposition of collagen, decreased collagenolytic activity could theoretically contribute to excess collagen deposition in IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>]. By analogy, human gingival fibroblasts isolated from fibrotic lesions appear to have a decreased phagocytic activity (for collagen) compared with those isolated from normal gingiva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>].

Further studies are necessary to clarify the role of collagen degradation in the pathogenesis of IPF.</p><p>While improved understanding of the distribution and composition of collagen in the fibrotic lung has led to insights in the pathobiology of IPF, there is no convincing evidence to date to support use of biomarkers of collagen metabolism for routine clinical use or therapeutic interventions.

In some (but not all) series, a high profusion of fibroblastic foci has been a marker for an increased risk of subsequent mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/152-155\" class=\"abstract_t\">152-155</a>]. A higher profusion of fibroblastic foci has also been associated with a decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) over 6 and 12 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. Although agreement is reasonable between various scoring systems for fibroblastic foci and between pathologists with expertise in lung histopathology, the agreement between community pathologists is likely to be lower and the utility of detailed scoring systems in the clinical management of patients with IPF has not been evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/154,156\" class=\"abstract_t\">154,156</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is now best conceptualized as a predominantly fibrotic disease that likely results from recurrent injury to the alveolar epithelium; once initiated, the abnormal fibrotic response to injury extends from the epithelium to the interstitial space. The identity and nature of the stimuli that trigger the initiating process in IPF are not understood, and in most cases cannot be recognized because patients generally seek help after the onset of symptoms, when the fibrotic process is already well established.</p><p>This inability to identify the initiating inflammatory process in human IPF (if there is one) may explain the failure of traditional antiinflammatory modalities, such as glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/1,157-159\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,157-159</a>]. As noted above, there is usually little or no evidence of inflammation at the time of diagnosis, which is when these agents have been used. As a result, it is not surprising that treatment with antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive agents has been largely ineffective. Monotherapy with N-acetylcysteine, a glutathione precursor and antioxidant, was also ineffective as it failed to decrease the rate of disease progression in IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With increasing recognition of the pathogenic role of fibroblast proliferation and fibrotic foci, treatment strategies have shifted towards antifibrotic agents. The rationale for the use of these agents rests upon the large amount of basic science data demonstrating an imbalance of cytokines, increased fibroblast proliferation, and excessive extracellular matrix deposition in the lungs of IPF patients. It is hoped that antifibrotic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pirfenidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pirfenidone</a>, monoclonal antibodies against profibrogenic cytokines [such as connective tissue growth factor(CTGF), lysyl oxidase, integrins], inhibitors of TGF-beta1, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, regulators of microRNAs) can interrupt the fibrotic process after it has been initiated and can improve outcomes, that are clinically meaningful for patients with IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/67,161-164\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,161-164</a>]. After clinical trials documented positive results in patients with IPF treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nintedanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nintedanib</a>, an intracellular inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, this medication has now been approved for treatment in IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/162,165\" class=\"abstract_t\">162,165</a>].

One hypothesis is that abnormal gastroesophageal reflux (GER) may contribute to lung injury and that prevention of microaspiration through adequate control of reflux may decrease the rate of progression of fibrosis. In this regard, there is increasing evidence to support this concept [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/170\" class=\"abstract_t\">170</a>]. A prospective study documented a significantly decreased rate of disease progression with anti-acid treatment in patients with well-defined IPF participating in three clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/171\" class=\"abstract_t\">171</a>].

It is possible that multiple microinjuries to alveolar epithelial cells induce a fibrotic environment, and that growth factors secreted by the injured epithelial cells activate and recruit fibroblasts.
