Macroscopically, there is a scarred appearance with fibrous or fibro-fatty replacement of myocardium. Multiple reports have historically characterized these pathologic changes as the &quot;triangle of dysplasia&quot; involving the inflow tract, outflow tract, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> apex of the right ventricle (RV). However, more recent data have noted involvement of the posterolateral left ventricle (LV) with sparing of the RV apex early in the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The RV myocardial scarring initially produces typical regional wall motion abnormalities but later may involve the free wall and become global, producing RV dilation. The tissue replacement can also involve areas of the LV with relative sparing of the septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Clinical perspectives of ARVC primarily arise from experience with patients who present with arrhythmias of RV origin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sudden death. However, additional information has been learned regarding the clinical features and clinical course of subjects identified based on electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and by cascade family screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Presentation is most common between the ages of 10 and 50 years, with a mean age at diagnosis of approximately 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. The disease is virtually never diagnosed in infants or toddlers and uncommonly before the age of 10. The diagnosis of ARVC requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and frequently multiple diagnostic tests or procedures.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of ARVC will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, genetics, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, and evaluation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-pathogenesis-and-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Pathogenesis and genetics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Anatomy, histology, and clinical manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Diagnostic evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">General therapeutic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the management of patients with ARVC, the overarching goal of therapy is the prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and to slow the rate of disease progression. Additionally, for symptomatic patients such as those with symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapies, an additional goal of treatment is to reduce the burden of VAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Our general approach to management is as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F117309\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef117309 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F116517\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116517 \">algorithm 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirm the diagnosis &ndash; Patients with suspected ARVC should have the diagnosis confirmed whenever possible and undergo relevant genetic testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Diagnostic evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activity restriction &ndash; Patients with ARVC should be restricted from endurance and competitive sports because of the strong links between exercise and the development of ARVC and the risk of VAs and heart failure (HF). (See <a href=\"#H2903240139\" class=\"local\">'Activity restriction'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of SCD risk and consideration for ICD placement &ndash; An ICD is indicated in patients who have been resuscitated from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), those who have experienced sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), and in those with multiple high-risk markers. These high-risk markers include arrhythmic syncope, severity of electrical manifestations of the disease (including the extent of T-wave inversion, the presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia [NSVT], a high ventricular premature beat [VPB] frequency, and a positive electrophysiologic [EP] study), and the severity of structural heart disease (ie, moderate to severe right ventricular [RV] or left ventricular [LV] dysfunction). Other variables that impact risk include proband status (risk greater in probands than family members), male gender, plan to continue endurance or competitive sports, presence of multiple mutations, and younger age. The more of these risk markers that are present, the higher the risk. However, it is difficult to give a specific cutoff as to the number of risk factors that need to be present to advise an ICD. Some risk factors, such as recent arrhythmic syncope, have a greater weight than other risk factors. As with all decisions to implant an ICD, the patient's preferences and values are paramount. (See <a href=\"#H3485252314\" class=\"local\">'Variables that impact sudden death risk in ARVC'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1717857965\" class=\"local\">'ICDs to prevent SCD'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockers &ndash; Patients with a prior history of SCA or documented ventricular tachyarrhythmias should receive a beta blocker, and prophylactic beta-blocker therapy is suggested for most patients with ARVC, even those without arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"#H2040310717\" class=\"local\">'Beta blockers'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjunctive therapy for VT &ndash; Patients who continue to experience ICD shocks despite beta-blocker therapy usually require additional therapy with either antiarrhythmic drug therapy or radiofrequency catheter ablation to reduce arrhythmia burden and ICD shocks. (See <a href=\"#H4206890877\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of recurrent or refractory ventricular arrhythmias'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who progress to severe RV or biventricular HF should receive standard therapy for HF, and those with an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) &le;35 percent should receive an ICD. On rare occasions, cardiac transplantation may be indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2862697489\" class=\"local\">'Management to prevent disease progression'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3136360912\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirmation of the diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the management of a patient with suspected ARVC is to confirm that the diagnosis is correct and perform genetic testing. The approach to making the diagnosis of ARVC and appropriate genetic testing is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H1211313735\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Diagnostic evaluation and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H3321285997\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Diagnostic evaluation and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Genetic testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2903240139\"><span class=\"h2\">Activity restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the risk of disease progression and the association between exercise and the development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, patients with ARVC should <strong>not</strong> participate in competitive or endurance sports, with the possible exception of those of low intensity (class IA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105651 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-19</a>]. Similarly, patients with ARVC should not participate in high-intensity noncompetitive sports, including basketball, ice hockey, sprinting, and singles tennis. Additionally, any activity, competitive or not, that causes symptoms of palpitation, presyncope, or syncope should be avoided. Specific activity recommendations are detailed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Athletes: Risk of sudden cardiac death&quot;, section on 'Arrhythmogenic (right and/or left) ventricular cardiomyopathy'</a>.)</p><p>There is mounting evidence that endurance and competitive exercise increase the likelihood of developing ARVC in gene carriers for an ARVC-related mutation. There is also considerable evidence that exercise increases arrhythmia risk and also the risk of developing HF and requiring cardiac transplantation. For this reason, we recommend that individuals diagnosed with ARVC restrict exercise. Exercise restriction should also be considered for gene carriers without clinical evidence of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16,18,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3485252314\"><span class=\"h2\">Variables that impact sudden death risk in ARVC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The next step in management involves an assessment of the patient's risk for SCD and the important decision as to whether placement of an ICD is warranted.

Twelve patients (46 percent) developed symptomatic arrhythmias, and the annual cardiac and sudden death mortalities were 3 and 2.3 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-pathogenesis-and-genetics#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Pathogenesis and genetics&quot;, section on 'Autosomal recessive disease and Naxos disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717857965\"><span class=\"h2\">ICDs to prevent SCD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sustained VAs are common in patients with ARVC, and ICD therapy (both antitachycardia pacing [ATP] and shocks) is effective for both primary and secondary prevention of SCD. While randomized trials have proven the efficacy of ICD implantation in preventing SCD in other clinical settings, there are no randomized trials comparing ICDs with medical therapy in patients with ARVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7,23,24,26,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,23,24,26,29-31</a>]. Patients with ARVC, who tend to be younger and otherwise relatively healthy, are known to have high rates of VT requiring ICD therapies. In a 2013 meta-analysis of 610 patients with ARVC from 18 cohorts with ICDs for either primary or secondary prevention (mean age 40 years, 42 percent women, mean follow-up 3.8 years), the annualized rate of appropriate ICD therapies was 9.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>These high rates of appropriate ICD discharge (7 to 10 percent per year) are consistent across major centers and continents, which we feel justifies the current recommendations for ICD use in high-risk patients with ARVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,22</a>]. Sudden death rates from the pre-ICD era are not available in equivalent numbers of patients; however, they appear much lower (less than 1 percent per year), a discrepancy that cannot be explained solely by the recognition that not all appropriate ICD discharges would have been lethal. The experience from one German center with expertise and longstanding experience in the management of ARVC contributes to these data, with mortality rates in the pharmacologic therapy era of less than 0.5 percent per year versus 7 percent per year in the ICD era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/29,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951745133\"><span class=\"h3\">ICDs for secondary prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who have been resuscitated from SCA, patients who have experienced sustained VT, and patients who have documented syncope with VT, we recommend ICD implantation for the secondary prevention of SCD. Beta-blocker therapy is also recommended in all of these patients. (See <a href=\"#H2040310717\" class=\"local\">'Beta blockers'</a> below.)</p><p>In a cohort of 312 patients with definite ARVC with ICDs (177 [57 percent] placed for secondary prevention), which was published after the 2013 meta-analysis, 186 patients (60 percent) experienced an appropriate ICD therapy over an average follow-up of 8.8 years, including 58 patients (19 percent) with ventricular fibrillation (VF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Over the same period, 64 patients (21 percent) experienced an inappropriate ICD intervention, primarily related to supraventricular tachycardia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1278066988\"><span class=\"h3\">ICDs for primary prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients without a history of SCA or sustained VT, but who have arrhythmic syncope or are considered at high risk due to evidence of moderate to severe structural heart disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> moderate to severe electrical manifestations of the disease (including T-wave inversion V1 to V3 and beyond), frequent VPBs, NSVT, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a positive EP study, we suggest ICD implantation for primary prevention of SCD. While event rates for patients with ARVC receiving an ICD for primary prevention are lower than for secondary prevention patients, they remain significant (approximately 5 percent per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,22</a>]. It is also important to recognize that, unlike in many cardiomyopathies, a family history of SCD in relatives with ARVC is not considered a marker of increased SCD risk for that individual. (See <a href=\"#H3485252314\" class=\"local\">'Variables that impact sudden death risk in ARVC'</a> above.)</p><p>In a multicenter series of 105 patients with ARVC who received an ICD for primary prevention based on risk factors such as syncope, NSVT, familial sudden death, and inducibility at programmed ventricular stimulation and were followed for an average of 58 months, 24 percent had an appropriate ICD intervention, and 16 percent had shocks for VF or ventricular flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. History of syncope was a significant predictor of appropriate ICD interventions and shocks for <span class=\"nowrap\">VF/ventricular</span> flutter, while none of 27 asymptomatic patients who received an ICD solely because of family history of sudden death had appropriate ICD therapy. Programmed ventricular stimulation had low predictive accuracy for ICD therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H1521893822\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Diagnostic evaluation and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Electrophysiologic testing and electroanatomic mapping'</a>.) </p><p>In selected circumstances, genotyping may help to select those patients and families at highest risk of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,26</a>]. Patients with multiple mutations and patients with Naxos disease (characterized by palmoplantar keratosis and woolly hair), other recessive forms of ARVC, and patients from Newfoundland with the <em>TMEM43</em> mutation are at an increased risk of SCD and may be candidates for implantation of an ICD for primary prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,34</a>]. In a retrospective case-control study that included 197 patients identified as at risk based upon clinical history, DNA haplotyping, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pedigree position, 48 had an ICD implanted (13 for secondary prevention) and were compared with an age-matched control group of 58 other high-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The five-year mortality for males in the control group was 28 percent, compared with 0 percent in the patients treated with an ICD. In general, however, neither family history nor other specific desmosomal variants help inform decisions regarding ICD implantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-pathogenesis-and-genetics#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Pathogenesis and genetics&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>ICD therapy should not be advised in patients who do not meet diagnostic criteria for ARVC unless they have experienced a sustained VA (ie, secondary prevention). In this regard, it is important to note that family members of the proband who are subsequently diagnosed with ARVC are generally at a reduced risk of life-threatening VAs as compared with probands. A history of SCD in a family member is not a risk marker for sudden death in other members of the family. Because of the long-term risks associated with ICD implantation, ICD implantation is only advised in patients who are at increased risk for SCD based on the ARVC diagnostic criteria described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>ICD therapy is also not recommended in persons who are genotype <span class=\"nowrap\">positive/phenotype</span> negative (so called healthy gene carriers). However, this population should undergo regular screening examinations to observe for the development of any phenotypic evidence of ARVC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-diagnostic-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Diagnostic evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3473384857\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of device and programming</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with ARVC in whom ICDs are contemplated are young and will likely require multiple ICD generator changes and possibly lead replacements over their lifetime. Thus, their lifetime risks of procedural- and device-related complications are greater than many patients treated with ICDs for other indications, emphasizing the importance of optimal device choice and programming in this population. General discussions of ICD programming and complications are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-optimal-programming\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators: Optimal programming&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac implantable electronic devices: Peri-procedural complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac implantable electronic devices: Long-term complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are two unique concerns related to ICD use in patients with ARVC that may contribute to the higher rate of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: thin areas of the RV myocardium that can be perforated during placement of the RV leads and fibrofatty changes in the RV that may interfere with adequate lead positioning and sensing of arrhythmias. In an effort to minimize lead-related complications, a single-chamber system is most often recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Additionally, there is a nontrivial risk of inappropriate ICD shocks. In a 2013 meta-analysis of 610 patients from 18 cohorts with ICDs for either primary or secondary prevention (mean age 40 years, 42 percent women, mean follow-up 3.8 years), the annualized rate of inappropriate ICD therapies was 3.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>ATP appears highly efficacious in terminating ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the ARVC population. In a prospective cohort study of 108 patients with ARVC and an ICD followed for an average of 3.3 years, 450 episodes of sustained monomorphic VT were treated with ATP, with successful termination of the VT in 412 episodes (92 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,30</a>].</p><p>Subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) systems, which do not require transvenous insertion of a lead into the RV, are an emerging option for some patients. The S-ICD alternative obviates the potential adverse effects of the leads to be both proarrhythmic and contribute to disease progression in a disease where the fundamental pathology involves integrity of the cell-to-cell junction. One major drawback of the S-ICD system, however, is its inability to deliver any pacing therapy, and hence, no ATP can be attempted as a means to terminate VT without a shock.

This is generally accomplished by prescription of a beta blocker and restriction of endurance and competitive sports. Antiarrhythmic therapy with a membrane-active drug is generally not considered in the absence of an ICD being implanted.

Eighteen patients with ARVC followed at a single center from 1995 to 2009 underwent successful cardiac transplantation (11 males, average age 40 years at time of transplant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Thirteen of the 18 underwent transplantation because of predominantly HF symptoms, while five had a transplant primarily for VT. Both short-term and long-term survival following transplantation were excellent (94 and 88 percent survival at one and six years, respectively). In a separate analysis of data from the UNOS database, which identified 73 patients with ARVC who underwent cardiac transplantation, survival at one and 10 years (87 and 77 percent, respectively) was not significantly different from the patients without ARVC who underwent transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Cardiac transplantation rates are much higher in those referral centers in which ablation and ICD use are most prevalent. The potential negative long-term effects of these therapies, however, have not been systematically evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and contraindications for cardiac transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ARVC usually present during the second to fifth decade of life with a variety of symptoms including palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, or uncommonly with sudden cardiac death (SCD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6,9,19,47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,19,47-49</a>]. It is extremely rare for patients with ARVC to have clinical signs or symptoms of ARVC prior to 10 to 12 years of age. It is also uncommon to first develop signs or symptoms of ARVC after the age of 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Symptoms are largely due to the presence of ventricular arrhythmias (VA). Heart failure (HF) is a late manifestation of the disease. </p><p>In a transatlantic study that included 439 probands with ARVC (mean age at presentation was 36 years), 48 index patients (11 percent) presented with cardiac arrest (median age 25 years at time of arrest), of whom 25 were resuscitated and 23 died, and the diagnosis was established at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. An additional 220 patients (50 percent) presented with a sustained VA, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted in 212 (87 percent) of the 245 patients with sustained VA or resuscitated SCD as compared with 139 (81 percent) of the 171 patients presenting without a sustained VA. A sustained VA was seen during follow-up in more than two-thirds of the entire group of patients (n = 301, 72 percent). Of the 65 patients without an ICD, 31 (48 percent) experienced a sustained VA during follow-up, and 11 died (17 percent) during a median follow-up of five years, 10 as a result of a cardiac arrest and one of HF. The incidence of SCD was 16 percent in patients without an ICD as compared with 0.6 percent among those with an ICD. During long-term follow-up, 54 patients (13 percent) developed symptomatic HF, and 18 (4 percent) had cardiac transplantation. Overall, 391 of the 416 patients (94 percent) who presented alive were living at last follow-up. </p><p>The clinical course of ARVC may be impacted by the number and type of mutations. ARVC is most commonly caused by mutations in desmosomal genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with variable penetrance and expressivity. In a study of 577 patients that included 22 patients (4 percent) with multiple mutations, patients with multiple mutations had significantly earlier occurrence (mean age 28 years compared with 35 years for the entire cohort) of sustained ventricular tachycardia <span class=\"nowrap\">(VT)/ventricular</span> fibrillation (VF), lower <span class=\"nowrap\">VT-/VF-free</span> survival, and more frequent left ventricular dysfunction (29 percent), HF (19 percent), and cardiac transplantation (9 percent) as compared with those with only one mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. <em>DSP</em> mutation carriers had a more than fourfold increased occurrence of left ventricular dysfunction (40 percent) and HF (13 percent) than <em>PKP2</em> carriers.
