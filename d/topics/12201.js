Patients often point toward the cervical region when asked to identify the site of their symptoms. Other common complaints include coughing, choking, drooling, and regurgitation when swallowing liquids or solid food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients may have a history of aspiration pneumonia and weight loss.</p><p>Patients often reposition their body to optimize alignment of the bolus for presentation to the pharynx. As an example, patients may report extending their arms and neck during swallowing, and will often use their finger to move food into proper position. Many patients will have made significant adjustments in their diet prior to seeking medical attention. In extreme cases, patients may sustain themselves entirely on a liquid diet before presenting to their physician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93725277\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of oropharyngeal dysphagia is based on a history of difficulty transferring food from the mouth to the pharynx and report a feeling of an obstruction in the neck. These symptoms also help exclude alternative diagnoses (eg, esophageal dysphagia, globus sensation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70866\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70866 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H93725271\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Esophageal dysphagia </strong>&ndash; Similar to patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, dysphagia related to distal esophageal disease, such as a peptic stricture, may sometimes be felt in the suprasternal notch. However, patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia have difficulty initiating a swallow and may have nasopharyngeal regurgitation, aspiration, and a sensation of residual food remaining in the pharynx. In contrast, esophageal dysphagia is characterized by difficulty swallowing several seconds after initiating a swallow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70866\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70866 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Globus sensation is defined as a persistent or intermittent nonpainful sensation of a lump or foreign body in the throat with the occurrence of the sensation between meals and the <strong>absence</strong> of dysphagia, odynophagia, an esophageal motility disorder, or gastroesophageal reflux as the cause of symptoms. These criteria must be fulfilled for the last three months with symptom onset at least six months before a diagnosis of globus sensation can be made. In contrast with patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia whose symptoms occur with swallowing, patients with a globus sensation report the sensation of a lump or foreign body independent of swallowing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=globus-sensation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Globus sensation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H244155913\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINING THE ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a diagnosis of oropharyngeal dysphagia, evaluation should be performed to determine the underlying etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52707\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52707 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54485\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54485 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93725999\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of associated symptoms and risk factors for oropharyngeal dysphagia can help determine the underlying etiology:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oropharyngeal dysphagia in an older patient, particularly with a history of alcohol abuse, smoking, blood in the mouth, or weight loss, should raise concern about a malignant cause. Referred pain, such as otalgia (ear pain), may indicate a hypopharyngeal lesion or cancer of the larynx, pharynx, and base of the tongue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of dry mouth or eyes may indicate inadequate salivary production. In such cases, it is particularly important to obtain a detailed review of medications that can reduce salivary flow (eg, anticholinergics, antihistamines, antihypertensive agents), a history of radiation therapy to the head and neck, or Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in speech suggest the presence of neuromuscular dysfunction. Hoarseness or a weak cough may represent vocal cord paralysis. Slurred speech may indicate weakness or incoordination of muscles involved in articulation and swallowing. Dysarthria (abnormal articulation), and nasal speech or regurgitation of food into the nose may represent weakness of the soft palate or pharyngeal constrictors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The combination of hoarseness, dysphonia (difficulty or pain in speaking), and nasal speech accompanying dysphagia is associated with a muscular dystrophy.

In addition, patients with a Zenker's diverticulum sometimes report coughing several minutes to hours after ingestion of a meal, which occurs during emptying of the diverticulum. Patients with intrinsic dysfunction of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), which consists of the cricopharyngeus muscle, inferior pharyngeal constrictor, and the cervical esophagus, may also present with frequent food impaction or aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The neurologic examination may also detect disorders with more subtle physical findings. As an example, decreased proximal strength may indicate dermatomyositis or polymyositis. Hoarseness of the voice may indicate the presence of vocal cord paresis or paralysis. Bilateral ptosis, muscle weakness, or repetitive efforts at swallowing are other signs suggestive of muscle disease. The presence of cogwheeling, rigidity, or a shuffling gait may indicate Parkinson disease. Motor and sensory abnormalities should raise the suspicion for multiple sclerosis, which is frequently associated with oropharyngeal dysphagia, but usually in the setting of longer disease duration and significant motor disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In addition to identifying the underlying etiology, the evaluation also serves to assess the severity of oropharyngeal dysfunction and degree of aspiration.</p><p>For patients with a history of or suspected neuromuscular disease, we perform videofluoroscopy with modified <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow and esophageal manometry to permit a detailed analysis of swallowing mechanics and pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/6,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11-13</a>].</p><p>For patients with no evidence of a systemic disease, we begin with fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (nasoendoscopy) and perform videofluoroscopy with modified <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow and manometry if no etiology is found.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Videofluoroscopic modified barium swallow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Videofluoroscopy with modified <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow permits functional evaluation of swallowing by visualization and analysis of the rapid sequence of events that make up a swallow. Videofluoroscopy serves to detect oropharyngeal dysfunction and to assess the degree of dysfunction and severity of aspiration. This technique allows for a more accurate assessment of laryngeal penetration.</p><p>In contrast with a standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow that involves ingestion of a thick barium solution while obtaining a sequence of x-rays at fixed points in time, in videofluoroscopy, video taken from both anteroposterior and lateral directions can be replayed at much slower speeds or even frame-by-frame to facilitate accurate analysis. In addition, the effects of different barium consistencies and positions can be tested (eg, thick or solid boluses in patients who primarily complain of solid food dysphagia). Videofluoroscopy is ideal for viewing the elevation of the hyoid and larynx, the relaxation of the UES, and contraction of the pharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>]. Videofluoroscopy can be used to analyze the movement of anatomic structures, muscle activity, and determine exact oral and pharyngeal transit times. It can also identify abnormal movement of a bolus, and identify aspiration and pooling in pharyngeal recesses.</p><p>However, videofluoroscopy has some limitations. The examination is limited to the cervical esophagus. In addition, parameters assessed by videofluoroscopy have not been standardized, thereby limiting its interobserver reliability. A study of 51 consecutive dysphagic patients referred for videofluoroscopy found the interobserver reliability to be high only for <span class=\"nowrap\">penetration/aspiration</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175893746\"><span class=\"h3\">Nasopharyngeal laryngoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasopharyngolaryngoscopy allows for a detailed examination of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and proximal esophagus to rule out a structural lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The vallecula, piriform sinuses, and perilaryngeal regions can also be inspected for pooled secretions or food material. This procedure is usually performed at the bedside by an otolaryngologist, and is associated with minimal discomfort to the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175893752\"><span class=\"h3\">Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) or nasoendoscopy is based upon nasopharyngoscopy with the addition of functional assessment. FEES provides the same view as one obtains with nasopharyngoscopy and is therefore the optimal method of identifying structural abnormalities in the oropharynx. It can also be used to obtain biopsies if needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54485\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54485 \">algorithm 1</a>). FEES involves passing a flexible fiberoptic endoscope transnasally to visualize the laryngeal and pharyngeal structures. Food and liquid boluses are then given to the patient so that both oropharyngeal structure and function can be evaluated during the pharyngeal phase of swallowing. Sensory testing can also be performed by administering pulses of air at sequentially increased pressures to elicit the laryngeal adductor reflex.</p><p>While there is good correlation between FEES and videofluoroscopy, <span class=\"nowrap\">penetration/aspiration</span> risk is perceived to be more severe on FEES as compared with videofluoroscopy assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Whether this difference in FEES and videofluoroscopic prediction of the likelihood of aspiration is of clinical significance is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. FEES has the advantage that it is safe, portable, and can be performed at the patient&rsquo;s bedside. In addition, it provides visualization of pharyngeal secretions that cannot be detected during videofluoroscopy. FEES can also help determine if pooled secretions are due to a decrease in swallowing frequency or dysphagia or both. However, FEES has the disadvantage that it requires specialized training in both swallow physiology and flexible endoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Manometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manometry of the UES provides quantitative evaluation of the pressures and relative timing involved in the pharyngeal contraction and deglutitive UES relaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/12,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20</a>]. Although manometry rarely leads to alteration in management of patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, it may help identify the underlying etiology and is useful in identifying patients who may benefit from surgical myotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19110537\" class=\"local\">'Cricopharyngeal myotomy'</a> below.)</p><p>An abnormality of the UES should be suspected if the pharyngeal wave does not occur within the period of UES relaxation.

Elevated resting pressures can occur as a primary disorder or, more commonly, may be associated with underlying gastroesophageal reflux. Reflux into the esophagus can result in reflexive UES contraction, which is primarily due to esophageal distension, although acid may also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormally low resting pressures of the UES (cricopharyngeal hypotonia) have been described in a variety of neuromuscular disorders (eg, myasthenia gravis, motor neuron disease [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis], and myotonic dystrophy). Dysphagia in such patients usually results from concomitant weakness of the pharyngeal musculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Incomplete relaxation of the UES can be seen in cases of cricopharyngeal bars and Zenker's diverticulum. Delayed UES relaxation is observed in patients with Riley-Day syndrome or familial dysautonomia and in patients with primary cricopharyngeal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Primary cricopharyngeal dysfunction is a rare functional disorder that is characterized by inadequate pharyngeal contraction, lack of coordination between the pharynx and the UES, or inadequate UES <span class=\"nowrap\">relaxation/reduced</span> muscular compliance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies&quot;, section on 'HSAN3 (Familial dysautonomia)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oropharyngeal-dysphagia-etiology-and-pathogenesis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Etiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Disorders of the pharyngeal phase'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Complete failure of UES relaxation (cricopharyngeal achalasia) is unusual.

Although failure of UES relaxation has been used to describe functional obstruction of the UES seen by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> studies, in such cases, poor opening of the UES is due to pharyngeal muscle weakness, poor elevation of the hyoid or decreased elasticity of the UES, rather than failure of its relaxation. Similarly, patients with a cricopharyngeal bar seen on barium studies (a defect in the upper esophagus at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle) usually have reduced muscle compliance of the cricopharyngeus rather than hypertension or failure of relaxation of the UES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p>High resolution manometry allows for more accurate analysis of the deglutitive UES relaxation as compared with standard manometry (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57536\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57536 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Patients often point toward the cervical region when asked to identify the site of their symptoms. Other common complaints include coughing, choking, drooling, and regurgitation when swallowing liquids or solid food. Patients may have a history of aspiration pneumonia and weight loss. (See <a href=\"#H244156078\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oropharyngeal dysphagia is an alarm symptom that warrants urgent evaluation. It is important to determine the underlying etiology and to assess the severity of oropharyngeal dysfunction prior to initiating treatment. A careful history can distinguish between an esophageal and oropharyngeal cause of dysphagia and globus sensation and may help identify the underlying etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70866\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70866 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52707\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52707 \">table 1</a>).

For patients with a history of or suspected neuromuscular disease, we perform videofluoroscopy and esophageal manometry to permit a detailed analysis of swallowing mechanics and pressures. For patients with no evidence of a systemic disease, we begin with fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (nasoendoscopy) and perform videofluoroscopy and manometry if no etiology is found. In patients in whom there is no known etiology despite fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, videofluoroscopy, and manometry, we perform a nasopharyngeal laryngoscopy to rule out a lesion in the oropharynx.

The approach depends in part upon the cause of the dysphagia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54485\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54485 \">algorithm 1</a>). In patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia following a stroke, head or neck trauma, surgery, or degenerative neurologic diseases, we suggest swallow rehabilitation to facilitate oral intake (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In patients with primary cricopharyngeal dysfunction, we suggest surgical myotomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
