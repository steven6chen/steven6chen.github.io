There are nonskeletal considerations with raloxifene that may play an important role in the selection of postmenopausal women for therapy: a reduction in breast cancer risk, but an increase in thromboembolic events and hot flashes, and no apparent effect on heart disease or the endometrium. Raloxifene inhibits bone resorption and reduces the risk of vertebral fracture, and it is our selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) of choice because it has eight-year safety and efficacy data and also reduces the risk of breast cancer. Raloxifene is usually chosen for osteoporosis prevention when there is an independent need for breast cancer prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bazedoxifene (available in Europe and Japan) has similar efficacy as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> in preventing and treating postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, there are few long-term safety data, and it has not been adequately studied for breast cancer prevention.</p><p>Bazedoxifene-conjugated equine estrogen is a combination drug available in some countries for the treatment of hot flashes and the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus. Although this combination is an option for menopausal women who have bothersome hot flashes (prohibiting the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> and bazedoxifene) and who are not candidates for or are intolerant of bisphosphonates, the absence of long-term fracture and safety data tempers our enthusiasm for bazedoxifene-conjugated equine estrogen. In addition, the effect of bazedoxifene-conjugated equine estrogen on breast cancer risk is unknown.</p><p>We favor bisphosphonates over SERMs for the <strong>treatment</strong> of osteoporosis because they have greater efficacy than SERMs in reducing nonspine and hip fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Raloxifene</a> is a reasonable alternative to bisphosphonates for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (low bone mineral density [BMD, T score &lt;-2.5] and no fragility fractures) who cannot tolerate or are not candidates for any bisphosphonates or for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are also at high risk for invasive breast cancer. We prefer raloxifene to bazedoxifene because it has long-term safety and efficacy data and because it has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer.
