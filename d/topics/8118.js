Despite the frequency of the condition, we lack a clear understanding of its pathogenesis. Nevertheless, decades of experience have suggested that an increase in ammonia concentration is implicated and that there may be a role for inhibitory neurotransmission through gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the central nervous system and changes in central neurotransmitters and circulating amino acids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Currently available therapies for hepatic encephalopathy are based on these hypotheses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64629\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64629 \">table 1</a>). Some treatments are based on clinical observations, some on extrapolation of experimental data obtained in animal models of hepatic encephalopathy, and a smaller number on randomized trials. However, there are a number of problems that interfere with the interpretation of data from these studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common problem is the variety of clinical conditions that are summarized under the term &quot;hepatic encephalopathy.&quot; The clinical features of hepatic encephalopathy include a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms ranging from minor, not readily discernible signs of altered brain function (minimal hepatic encephalopathy), to overt psychiatric <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic symptoms, to deep coma. As a result, the methods to quantify treatment effects and endpoints are highly variable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not known if data regarding treatment in patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy can be extrapolated to minimal hepatic encephalopathy and vice versa. However, many studies included patients both with overt and minimal hepatic encephalopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another important variable is the treatment of control groups. Very few studies use a placebo; in most cases, the new drug was compared with &quot;standard treatment&quot; (which by itself may be highly effective) or specifically to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sample size of most published studies was small.</p><p/><p>This topic will review the management of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver disease. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy and the approach to patients with hepatic encephalopathy in the setting of acute liver failure are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Hepatic encephalopathy'</a>.)</p><p>The management of hepatic encephalopathy has also been addressed in a 2014 joint guideline from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

Whether to admit a patient with grade II encephalopathy to the hospital will depend on the degree of lethargy and confusion. If there is any concern that a patient may not be able to adhere to treatment or if caregivers are not available who can monitor the patient, the patient should be admitted to the hospital for care. Patients with more severe hepatic encephalopathy (grades III to IV) require hospital admission for treatment, typically to an intensive care unit. In addition, consideration should be given to intubating such patients for airway protection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H152814304\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Categorization and grading'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65805031\"><span class=\"h3\">General supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General supportive care for patients with hepatic encephalopathy includes providing appropriate nutritional support, avoiding dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities, and providing a safe environment. Precautions to prevent falls should be instituted for patients who are disoriented. </p><p>Patients hospitalized with hepatic encephalopathy may be agitated. Agitation often resolves with treatment of the hepatic encephalopathy; however, patients may represent a hazard to themselves and their caregivers until treatment takes effect. Management may include judicious use of restraints, which may be a safer option than pharmacologic treatment, since patients with advanced liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy may be particularly vulnerable to oversedation with medications. Should medications be required, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> is a safer option than benzodiazepines based mainly on clinical experience and some limited data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients with advanced cirrhosis may be particularly sensitive to benzodiazepines because of an increased concentration of benzodiazepine receptor ligands in the brain. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Flumazenil'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H250645391\"><span class=\"h3\">Protein restriction and nutritional support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritional support should include maintaining an energy intake of 35 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day,</span> with a protein intake of 1.2 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span>. Patients with cirrhosis are often malnourished and protein restrictions are associated with increased mortality, so patients with hepatic encephalopathy should generally not have their protein intake restricted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-treatment/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Patients with mild to moderate hepatic encephalopathy can typically take nutrition orally. Patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy usually do not receive oral nutrition. As soon as they improve, a standard diet can be given. Patients should be instructed to eat small meals throughout the day with a late-night snack of complex carbohydrates because fasting results in the production of glucose from amino acids, with resultant ammonia production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Another alternative for patients intolerant to protein is the addition of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) to a low protein diet. BCAA supplementation is indicated only in severely protein-intolerant patients. As a general rule, only patients who have had a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or surgical portosystemic shunt have hepatic encephalopathy severe enough to warrant use of vegetable protein or protein restriction with BCAA supplementation.

Polyethylene glycol is also being studied for the treatment of acute hepatic encephalopathy and appears to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It is important to note that an elevated serum ammonia level in the absence of clinical signs of hepatic encephalopathy is not an indication for ammonia-lowering therapy.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Commonly used treatments'</a> below and <a href=\"#H250645391\" class=\"local\">'Protein restriction and nutritional support'</a> above.)</p><p>Drug therapy is the mainstay of treatment to lower the blood ammonia concentration. Our approach to drug therapy is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest initiating drug therapy for acute hepatic encephalopathy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a> or lactitol (available in some countries outside of the United States). Lactulose and lactitol act through a variety of mechanisms that lead to decreased absorption of ammonia from the gastrointestinal tract. The dose of lactulose (30 to 45 mL [20 to 30 g] given two to four times per day) should be titrated to achieve two to three soft stools per day. An equivalent dose of lactitol is approximately 67 to 100 grams lactitol powder, diluted in 100 mL of water. Lactulose or lactitol enemas can be given if the patient cannot take lactulose orally. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Lactulose and lactitol'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ornithine-aspartate, which stimulates the metabolism of ammonia, is an alternative for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, but it is not available in the United States.

The dose of rifaximin is 400 mg orally three times daily or 550 mg orally two times daily. As a general rule, antibiotics are added to, rather than substituted for, lactulose or lactitol.

Three studies suggested lower mortality in BCAA-treated patients, while two others suggested that BCAA-treatment increased mortality. The studies included in this meta-analysis differed with respect to the amino acid solutions used, the study protocols, patient selection, and the duration of treatment, and therefore cannot be compared directly.

The addition of BCAA to the diet enabled the daily protein intake to be increased to up to 80 g without worsening cerebral function; by comparison, many control patients (receiving casein as a protein source) deteriorated after increasing dietary protein intake. No benefit of BCAA supplementation was observed in protein-tolerant patients. A subsequent randomized trial of 116 patients who had a prior episode of hepatic encephalopathy found no benefit of BCAA on recurrent encephalopathy, although supplementation appeared to improve minimal hepatic encephalopathy and muscle mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-treatment/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

This complex, in the postsynaptic membrane, is the principal inhibitory network in the central nervous system. It consists of a GABA-binding site, a chloride channel, and barbiturate and benzodiazepine receptor sites. GABAergic transmission may interact with ammonia in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-treatment/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Increases in transmission could be caused by increases in ligands for any of the three receptors.
