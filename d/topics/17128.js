Overall, the prevalence is higher in individuals who are 60 years and older as compared with younger adults and is higher in non-Hispanic blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F66935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66935 \">figure 1</a>). The prevalence of hypertension in children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It remains unclear why non-Hispanic blacks are more likely to become hypertensive. Both genetic and environmental factors are probably important, one of which may be a greater likelihood of low birth weight, which appears to predict higher pressures in adulthood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=possible-role-of-low-birth-weight-in-the-pathogenesis-of-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Possible role of low birth weight in the pathogenesis of primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in blacks&quot;</a>.)</p><p>NHANES data from 2011 to 2014 demonstrated that 46 percent of adults 18 years and older in the United States had hypertension (defined as patient report of taking antihypertensive medication or a systolic pressure &ge;130 mmHg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a diastolic pressure &ge;80 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-prevalence-and-control-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Based upon the size of the adult population, this translates into 103 million adults with hypertension. Prior to the redefinition of hypertension by the 2017 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guidelines, the prevalence of hypertension (defined as taking antihypertensive medication or a systolic pressure &ge;140 mmHg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a diastolic pressure &ge;90 mmHg) was 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-prevalence-and-control-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and had remained relatively constant since 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-prevalence-and-control-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>Using the prior definition of hypertension, prevalence estimates among adults from 90 countries worldwide (approximately 31 percent in 2010) were similar to those in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-prevalence-and-control-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In surveys similar to NHANES that were performed in Canada and Europe, the age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of hypertension (defined as <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg or higher) ranged from 20 to 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-prevalence-and-control-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A population-based screening study in China of 1.7 million adults aged 35 to 75 years found a prevalence of hypertension of 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-prevalence-and-control-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The estimated global prevalence of hypertension is increasing. In a review, pooled data suggested that 26 percent of the world's adult population (972 million) had hypertension, using the prior definition, in the year 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-prevalence-and-control-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In 2010, this estimate increased to 31 percent of the global population, or 1.39 billion people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-prevalence-and-control-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Rates were higher in low- and middle-income (31.5 percent) than in high-income (28.5 percent) countries. Long-term projections suggest that, by 2025, 29 percent of adults worldwide would have hypertension (ie, 1.56 billion people globally) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-prevalence-and-control-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTROL OF HYPERTENSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worldwide, hypertension is not adequately controlled, and control is worse in lower-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-prevalence-and-control-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In 2010, control of hypertension (defined, at the time, as <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;140/&lt;90</span> mmHg) was estimated to be 28 percent in high-income and 8 percent in middle- and low-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-prevalence-and-control-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>].
