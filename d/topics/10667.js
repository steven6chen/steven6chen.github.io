With partial venous obstruction, the condition can be asymptomatic, but progression with symptoms related to chronic venous hypertension or venous occlusion can occur, with or without venous thrombosis. It is important to keep this condition in mind whenever a patient presents acutely with lower extremity swelling or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), particularly young women. </p><p>The approach to diagnosis and treatment depends upon whether venous thrombosis is present. When the diagnosis is highly suspected based upon clinical features or noninvasive vascular imaging, a definitive diagnosis is established using intravascular ultrasound (after removal of thrombus, if necessary). Minimally invasive treatment (angioplasty and stenting) of the venous lesion relieves outflow obstruction and provides immediate relief of symptoms with good long-term patency rates. For those with venous thrombosis, rates of post-thrombotic syndrome are reduced with endovascular treatment.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of MTS are reviewed here. General considerations for the diagnosis and management of venous thromboembolism are reviewed separately.

MTS is also referred to as iliocaval venous compression syndrome, iliac vein compression syndrome, Cockett's syndrome, and venous spur. The most common variant of MTS is due to compression of the left iliac vein between the overlying right common iliac artery and the fifth lumbar vertebrae, but others exist. </p><p>In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, it was observed that deep vein thrombosis was five times more likely to occur in the left leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, left iliac vein compression as a cause of isolated left lower extremity swelling was not described until 1908 and not fully understood until the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In approximately 22 percent of 430 cadavers, May and Thurner noted intraluminal thickening (&quot;venous spurs&quot;), which appeared to be directly and most commonly related to external compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery against the fifth lumbar vertebra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. They suggested that the chronic pulsation of the right common iliac artery initiated a &quot;spur&quot; and caused venous outflow <span class=\"nowrap\">obstruction/stenosis</span> and venous hypertension in the ipsilateral limb. They described three histologic types of spurs: central, lateral, and fenestrated. The relationship between iliac vein compression and post-thrombotic syndrome was later illustrated by Cockett in 1967 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>The majority of cases follow the classic left-sided description, but other variants have been reported, such as right-sided MTS and compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC) by the right common iliac artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2075458281\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact incidence and prevalence of MTS are unknown but are likely underestimated given that most individuals with MTS anatomy do not have symptoms and require no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. The prevalence of hemodynamically significant lesions (ie, &gt;50 percent stenosis) was approximately 25 percent in a study that reviewed 50 abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans performed for abdominal pain but without suggestive left lower extremity symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The mean patient age was 50 years. </p><p>Among patients who present with a symptomatic lower extremity venous disorder, MTS is estimated to be the etiology in 2 to 5 percent of patients, although some retrospective reviews have reported much higher rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/1,3,8,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,8,14-16</a>]. In a study of mechanical thrombectomy for proximal deep vein thrombosis, an underlying lesion responsible for the occlusion was uncovered in 59 percent (10 of 17 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71631947\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for MTS are listed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/8,11,18-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,18-24</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1497304080\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Swelling usually involves the entire limb. With unilateral presentations, a size discrepancy between the limbs is usually noticeable. Over the course of the day, venous outflow restriction causes venous hypertension that escalates throughout the day, particularly after prolonged sitting or standing, causing significant limb swelling and tenderness. Lower extremity swelling may or may not be associated with venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, less commonly pulmonary embolism).

Others suggest limiting the evaluation to only those with the highest risk for MTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. As noted above, the prevalence of MTS is increased in young women. </p><p>In general: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients suspected of having MTS, but without the presence of concomitant DVT on initial studies, additional noninvasive venous imaging (duplex ultrasound, computed tomographic [CT] or magnetic resonance [MR] venography) should be obtained first in an effort to identify the lesion. If these are inconclusive and suspicion remains high (ie, presence of one or more of the features listed below), invasive venous imaging may be warranted.

Although venous ultrasound has high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of proximal DVT using B-Mode using compressibility criterion, the deep location of the proximal iliac vein along with other factors (eg, obesity, overlying gas) may limit ultrasound for making an accurate diagnosis of MTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. </p><p>We use the ultrasound parameters previously described to diagnose iliocaval stenosis, including poststenotic turbulence as indicated by the mosaic appearance (noisy signal), an abnormal Doppler signal at the area of stenosis, and sluggish <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> no spontaneous flow as well as very poor augmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The contralateral vasculature serves as a control if inferior vena cava <span class=\"nowrap\">thrombosis/occlusion</span> is not present. </p><p>The angle of insonation should be kept at &lt;60&deg;, and a 4- to 7-MHz linear array transducer is commonly used to evaluate the common femoral vein, while 2 to 3 MHz should be used to evaluate iliac and caval vessels. B-mode will help to compare vein diameter reduction at the smallest lumen area to that of normal vein diameter. Peak vein velocity (PVV) is measured in the poststenotic and compared to the prestenotic segment; a PVV gradient &gt;2.0 is considered significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2507930308\"><span class=\"h3\">CT/MR venography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cross-sectional imaging (eg, CT scan with venous phase, or MR venography) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111782\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111782 \">image 2</a>) is sensitive for estimating the location and degree of stenosis in nonthrombosed veins, identifying venous collaterals, and identifying other anatomic variations. </p><p>Both CT and MR venograms have &gt;95 percent sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing MTS, but these imaging modalities require adequate technical protocols for imaging acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>]. </p><p>CT venography may be better at identifying more severely stenotic lesions and has the advantage of identifying other causes of extrinsic venous compression; however, a nondiagnostic test can result from technical issues such as suboptimal contrast opacification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/39,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,43</a>]. MR venography provides better imaging of the pelvic and spinal structures including lumbar vertebral degeneration, bulging or protruding intervertebral discs, osteophytes, or spondylolisthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/38,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2468546918\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive venous imaging</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1924990428\"><span class=\"h3\">Catheter-based venography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheter-based venography is warranted if there is a sufficient level of clinical suspicion for MTS in a patient with acute symptoms or if the patient has advanced clinical manifestations of chronic venous disease (CEAP [Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology] Clinical Class 4 to 6, or CEAP Class 3 with massive edema). </p><p>Although less invasive imaging is useful for identifying thrombus and evaluating for other possible causes of venous compression, it is important to remember that an occlusive iliac vein lesion cannot be excluded with certainty using noninvasive assessments. </p><p>Catheter-based contrast venography, particularly with the added use of transvenous pressure measurements, has long been considered the gold-standard diagnostic test for MTS; however, because the study is invasive, it typically is not performed unless there is diagnostic uncertainty or treatment is expected. The other modalities described above are more frequently used initially to establish the diagnosis. Venography can provide insight toward chronicity of lesions as well as variable congenital features that may be associated, such as duplicated or rudimentary venous systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p>Contrast venography may fail to provide an accurate diagnosis, but a few steps can be taken to improve accuracy. Obtaining two or three projections during the injection phase is important since a &quot;pancaked&quot; vein (ie, externally compressed in the anteroposterior [AP] plane) will not exhibit diameter narrowing in the AP view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Some clinicians feel that it is equally effective to perform hand-injection venography through the access sheath rather than using a power injector.</p><p>A specific diameter threshold defining a stenotic lesion has not been validated for the venous system. Although no study has identified what degree of stenosis will to lead to symptoms, some have suggested that relief of symptoms is more likely with correction of stenosis greater than 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. However, determining the degree of stenosis can be difficult. Veins are compliant and affected by factors (eg, volume status) that determine the degree of vein collapse or distention. Veins can also appear stenotic in one dimension when there is no decrease in the actual lumen surface area compared with more rounded segments of the vessel. </p><p>Invasive hemodynamic pressure measurements are a valuable adjunct for confirming the presence of the venous stenotic lesion associated with MTS. Simultaneous pressure measurements from both iliac veins can be obtained and compared; normally there should be no difference. An iliac vein pressure gradient more than 2 mmHg at rest is considered important when evaluating venous outflow stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A pullback method measuring the pressure in the lower inferior vena cava above the obstruction site and comparing it with the pressure obtained in the more distal iliac vein may be more accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Again, there should be a pressure gradient between the two segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/26,37,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,37,49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H613715966\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravascular ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We regard intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) as the current venous imaging standard for establishing a diagnosis of MTS as well as a valuable adjunct for treatment. The sensitivity and specificity of IVUS for venous stenosis exceeds 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/48,50-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50-54</a>]. IVUS shows the precise morphology of the &quot;spur&quot; and can be used to estimate the severity and distribution of pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, IVUS is invasive and is generally used in conjunction with venography at the time of anticipated intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2094891663\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the patient'</a> below.)</p><p>Since its inception and use over the last decade, IVUS has become an integral component of the treatment of MTS. IVUS is useful for determining vessel diameter, aiding accurate stent placement, ensuring full stent expansion, estimating the gain in cross-sectional area, and, with follow-up, identifying the severity of in-stent restenosis. (See <a href=\"#H2094891663\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the patient'</a> below.)</p><p>IVUS emits high-frequency sound waves from the ultrasound transducer on the catheter, which provide the operator with a real-time intraoperative tool to examine the target vessel that is both sensitive and objective. At least two types of IVUS are available, mechanical and solid state (digital and rotational catheters).

Angioplasty of the venous stenotic lesion alone is not sufficient and is associated with high recurrence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Stenting is not universally agreed upon, and recurrence rates may depend on stent type used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Thus, we use self-expanding stents with post-stenting balloon dilation to fully expand the stent. We agree with others that extending the stent into the inferior vena cava (IVC) has no negative impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Angioplasty and stenting of MTS lesions also decreases the recurrence rate of superficial reflux following ablation therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Subsequent treatment is aimed at decreasing the volume of thrombus using catheter-direct thrombolysis or pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, evaluating for underlying intrinsic venous stenosis, and, if present, angioplasty and stenting of the diseased iliocaval segment. The appropriate expertise and institutional resources must be available to provide this intervention. Where this is not available, an alternative strategy may be anticoagulation with interval follow-up vascular imaging; however, medical treatment with anticoagulation alone is associated with suboptimal outcomes in those with MTS. With successful treatment of MTS, rates of post-thrombotic syndrome are less than 10 percent. Without treatment, post-thrombotic syndrome is estimated to occur in 80 to 90 percent.

Although anticoagulant regimens have improved outcomes compared with historical series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], open surgery is only indicated for failure of endovascular therapy given the operative dissection, morbidity, and overall worse results for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. The open surgical approach includes dissection of the iliac vein from the overlying iliac vein, open thrombectomy, and possible patch angioplasty of the left iliac vein, possibly adding adjunctive procedures, such as an arteriovenous fistula to enhance flow in the diseased vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/may-thurner-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

The left popliteal vein was accessed via the micropuncture technique, a 5-Fr sheath was placed, and a soft guidewire and guiding catheter were used to cross multiple venous occlusive segments, and intraluminal location was confirmed with venography. Over a stiff wire, a 7-Fr sheath was placed into the left popliteal vein. The venogram showed complete occlusion of the left common iliac, common femoral, and femoral veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111784\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111784 \">image 4</a>). </p><p>Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis was initiated with placement of a 50-cm catheter (eg, UniFuse), and thrombolysis with TPA was started with a 4-mg intraoperative pulse injection followed by a 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour</span> infusion and 600 units of heparin over the next 24 hours. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and monitored. A tight ACE bandage was applied from the left foot up to the groin crease to augment venous drainage once the outflow obstruction was relieved, sequential compression devices (SCDs) were placed bilaterally, and legs were elevated to 45&deg; elevation. Repeat venography of the iliac veins at 24 hours showed a significant thrombus burden in the iliac and femoral veins. The infusion was continued for another 12 hours. </p><p>A venogram was repeated again at 36 hours and revealed 80 percent stenosis of the left common iliac vein, typical of MTS, and IVUS was used to confirm and measure the common iliac vein diameter. A 16-mm self-expanding stent (eg, Wallstent) was placed and dilated with a 14-mm balloon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111785\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111785 \">image 5</a>). Completion venography showed a patent iliac vein with no residual stenosis. Systemic anticoagulation with heparin was resumed in four hours, and the patient was transitioned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy. </p><p>The patient was discharged to home on postprocedure day 5 with thigh-high compression stockings (30 to 40 mmHg). The IVC filter was retrieved at 90 days. Anticoagulation was continued for six months, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> was prescribed for the initial six weeks after stent placement. Thereafter the patient was maintained on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. The patient was followed clinically for two years and experienced no further symptoms related to MTS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3575990352\"><span class=\"h3\">Bilateral chronic MTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 34-year-old female presented with severe bilateral lower extremity swelling and bilateral venous claudication, which had persistently progressed. She started to have skin changes consistent with lipodermatosclerosis. A venous reflux study showed bilateral lower common femoral venous reflux of 4.5 seconds on the left and 2.5 seconds on the right side.</p><p>The patient was taken for venography and positioned supine. An 8-Fr sheath was placed into each femoral vein using ultrasound guidance and a micropuncture technique. Bilateral venography was performed. IVUS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F112060\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef112060 \">movie 1</a>) demonstrated significant stenosis at the IVC bifurcation with a 95 percent stenosis in the left proximal common iliac vein and 80 percent on the right. After calibrating the degree and length of stenosis with IVUS, bilateral self-expanding stents were placed, an 18x60-mm stent on the left and an 18x40-mm stent on the right (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F112058\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef112058 \">image 6</a>). Post-stent angioplasty was performed with a 16x40-mm balloon. Post-stenting IVUS showing resolution of the stenoses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F112061\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef112061 \">movie 2</a>).

The clopidogrel was discontinued after eight weeks, while the aspirin was continued indefinitely. The patient was instructed to continue using 20- to 30-mmHg compression stockings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2522886183\"><span class=\"h3\">Pediatric MTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 14-year-old female presented with severe swelling and aching pain of her left lower extremity for one day. A venous duplex ultrasound revealed acute extensive DVT from left external iliac vein distally. Systemic heparin infusion was started intravenously. </p><p>A venogram was performed via the right common femoral approach to confirm patency of the IVC, and a retrievable IVC filter was placed. The patient was positioned prone, and the left popliteal vein was accessed via micropuncture 4-Fr sheath and upgraded to a 5-Fr sheath placed in the left popliteal vein. A soft glidewire and catheter were used to navigate the thrombosed left venous system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111786\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111786 \">image 7</a>), and the intraluminal position of the guide catheter was confirmed. </p><p>Mechanical thrombolysis was performed, followed by TPA at 1.2 mg per hour along with 500 units of heparin via the side port of the 5-Fr sheath. Repeat venography was performed at 24 hours and showed improvement but incomplete resolution of the thrombus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111787\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111787 \">image 8</a>). IVUS evaluation of the iliac system was performed, showing left iliac stenosis. The common and external iliac veins were angioplastied using a 14-mm balloon. Thrombolysis was continued for another 12 hours, and venography showed improvement with less than 20 percent residual stenosis of the common iliac system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111786\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111786 \">image 7</a>). Based on the patient's age, it was elected not to pursue stenting. In the author's opinion, stenting should be reserved for patients &gt;18 years old to avoid compromise to the integrity of the iliac stent, which might occur due to continued growth. The patient was discharged to home on full anticoagulation and 30-mmHg thigh-high compression stockings. The IVC filter was retrieved at three months. The patient continued to do well at her 24-month follow-up visit with no recurrent symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2319223681\"><span class=\"h3\">Acquired MTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 64-year-old male presented with acute onset of severe swelling and pain in the left lower extremity. The patient had a history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that had been treated with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Venous duplex ultrasound revealed acute extensive DVT from the iliac vein distally. Systemic anticoagulation was initiated, and an IVC venogram was performed via the right common femoral vein. </p><p>A retrievable IVC filter was inserted. The patient was positioned supine, the left popliteal vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle using ultrasound, and a 7-Fr sheath was inserted. The venogram showed acute extensive DVT of the left lower extremity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111788\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111788 \">image 9</a>). A 5-Fr angle guide catheter and a soft angled hydrophilic guidewire were used to navigate through multiple areas of <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/occlusion</span> until the intraluminal position of the guide catheter in the IVC was confirmed. Mechanical thrombolysis (eg, AngioJet) was performed, followed by bolus of 2 mg TPA diluted in a 60-cc syringe. A continuous drip of TPA (1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour)</span> was started and continued for 36 hours. After 36 hours, a completion angiogram detected a culprit lesion of the right common iliac vein as well as 70 percent concentric disease of the external iliac vein. An IVUS catheter was used to calibrate the common iliac vein and to place a 14-mm stent (eg, Wallstent) into the external iliac vein and a 16-mm stent (eg, Wallstent) into the common iliac vein. </p><p>Completion venography showed complete resolution of the lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111788\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111788 \">image 9</a>). The patient was continued on anticoagulation, prescribed thigh-high compression stockings (30 to 40 mmHg), and discharged on postoperative day 5. The IVC filter was removed at three months. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H239060317\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

With partial obstruction, the condition can be asymptomatic, but progression to symptomatic extensive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can occur. The majority of cases are left-sided, but other variants exist. (See <a href=\"#H1497304080\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of MTS is unknown for certain and is likely underestimated, largely because most individuals with this anatomic anomaly remain asymptomatic. Among symptomatic patients, MTS has been estimated to be the underlying etiology in 2 to 5 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H2075458281\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for MTS include female gender, particularly those who are postpartum, multiparous, or using oral contraceptives; individuals with spinal abnormalities; or prior aortoiliac vascular stent placement (acquired form of MTS). The development of symptomatic MTS may be more likely in the face of dehydration or hypercoagulable states. (See <a href=\"#H2075458281\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients can present acutely with extremity pain and swelling, with venous claudication, or with chronic development of <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/signs</span> of venous insufficiency. The classic clinical presentation is that of a younger female in the second or third decade of life presenting acutely with left lower extremity swelling that involves the entire limb. (See <a href=\"#H436415809\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of MTS may be suspected based upon clinical features and initial diagnostic testing, typically duplex ultrasound. A definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the stenotic or occlusive venous lesion on vascular imaging (see <a href=\"#H1059754754\" class=\"local\">'Approach to MTS diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients suspected of having MTS but without venous thrombosis, advanced noninvasive venous imaging (computed tomographic [CT] or magnetic resonance [MR] venography) should be obtained first to make the diagnosis prior to invasive diagnostic testing and intervention. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who present with DVT, a presumptive clinical diagnosis of MTS can be made based on risk factors and characteristic clinical features that are highly suggestive of MTS (eg, young age, female, left-sided extensive acute or recurrent DVT). The definitive diagnosis is established with invasive venous imaging after removal of the thrombus as described below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced noninvasive venous imaging can suggest a diagnosis of MTS with reasonable accuracy. However, to definitively establish a diagnosis of MTS, we prefer to use intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). IVUS is highly sensitive and specific and also shows the precise morphology of the &quot;spur&quot; and degree of stenosis. IVUS requires insertion of the transducer directly into the vein and is generally used in conjunction with catheter-based venography at the time of anticipated intervention. (See <a href=\"#H613715966\" class=\"local\">'Intravascular ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of MTS depends upon the presence of symptoms and their severity and whether DVT is present (see <a href=\"#H2094891663\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the patient'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients identified with MTS anatomy who lack symptoms, no treatment is needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For mildly symptomatic MTS in the absence of DVT, we suggest conservative management rather than intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Compression stockings are usually sufficient to manage mild symptoms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For moderate-to-severe symptomatic MTS in the absence of DVT, treatment is targeted toward reducing the severity of the chronic venous <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/occlusion</span>. We suggest angioplasty and stenting of the affected segment, rather than angioplasty alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Angioplasty alone is associated with recurrent stenosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For suspected MTS in a patient with DVT, we suggest catheter-directed thrombolysis or pharmacomechanical thrombolysis in addition to anticoagulation rather than anticoagulation alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This uncovers the lesion and confirms the diagnosis. In addition, catheter-directed thrombolysis appears to be associated with more complete thrombus resolution and reduced risk for post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). The appropriate expertise and institutional resources must be available to provide this intervention. If appropriate resources are not available, anticoagulation alone with interval follow-up vascular imaging is a reasonable alternative; however, the risk of PTS is high with this approach. If venous stenosis is confirmed, subsequent management is the same as in patients with moderate-to-severe symptomatic MTS without DVT (ie, angioplasty and stenting). Anticoagulation is continued per venous thromboembolism (VTE) guidelines. (See <a href=\"#H680095407\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of endovenous therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt#H3666926\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&quot;, section on 'Long-term anticoagulation (10 days to 3 months)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Following angioplasty and stenting for symptomatic MTS, we prescribe knee or thigh-high compression stockings (30 to 40 mmHg) and antiplatelet therapy, provided bleeding risk is low. (See <a href=\"#H4217360326\" class=\"local\">'MTS protocols and example cases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open surgical treatment (open venous angioplasty, venous bypass) is associated with worse outcomes compared with percutaneous <span class=\"nowrap\">angioplasty/stenting</span> and is rarely needed to manage MTS. However, if thrombolysis is contraindicated, an open cut-down via a common femoral venotomy can be used to evacuate thrombus to uncover the lesion prior to percutaneous angioplasty and stenting.
