It is often associated with one or more of several articular features, including synovitis, enthesitis, and dactylitis. It may also be associated with several non-articular features; these include uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Patients frequently carry the gene for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, and patients with active inflammatory disease often have evidence of an elevated acute phase response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with axSpA are classified as having either of two subtypes of axSpA: ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA). Patients with AS exhibit radiographic abnormalities consistent with sacroiliitis, but such findings are not evident on plain radiography in nr-axSpA. Instead, in patients with nr-axSpA, the diagnosis is supported by evidence of active inflammation of the sacroiliac (SI) joints on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a combination of other findings. In clinical practice, distinction between these forms of axSpA in an individual patient has limited impact on management and may not be relevant, although the classification is of interest for epidemiologic and other investigative purposes. (See <a href=\"#H97035242\" class=\"local\">'Nomenclature and classification'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of AS and nr-axSpA will be reviewed here together as axSpA. The clinical manifestations, treatment, and pathogenesis of this disorder are discussed separately.

There is no single historical feature, physical finding, laboratory test, or imaging study with sufficient specificity by itself to establish the diagnosis without the presence of additional abnormalities. Thus, the diagnosis cannot depend only upon a single checklist of features; and classification criteria, which are designed for use in epidemiologic and clinical research, cannot be relied upon to establish a diagnosis of axSpA in practice.

Three findings in patients with chronic back pain starting at an age younger than 45 years have been proposed that should prompt rheumatologic referral: a positive test for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, the presence of IBP, or findings of sacroiliitis on imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].

One study found that in recreational runners and elite athletes (ice-hockey players), BME fulfilling the ASAS definition for positive findings was present in about 30 to 41 percent, with the most affected joint quadrant being the posterior lower ilium, although erosions were virtually absent in these individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Another study, which included 47 healthy individuals without back pain and 47 others with axSpA and positive MRI findings, found that while BME could be detected in 23 percent of the healthy individuals, none of the BME findings included deep lesions (a homogenous and unequivocal increase in signal extending at least 1 cm from the articular surface). Efforts to better define those findings that are disease-specific remain important.</p><p>In general, the MRI should be read taking all features into consideration, as well as their extent and intensity and the possibility of false positives such as blood vessels, and the reader should generate a global index of suspicion of whether the MRI is consistent with axSpA. Interpretation of the MRI changes and determination of whether the MRI of a particular patient is positive or not should always be determined in the context of all of the clinical, laboratory, and other imaging parameters available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. We thus prefer that a rheumatologist involved in the care of a given patient participates in the assessment and interpretation of the imaging findings.

However, MRI of the more painful areas of the spine may be helpful in the small number of patients with a high level of suspicion for nr-axSpA (patients with clinical features of SpA with normal or uncertain SI joint radiography) but in whom MRI of the SI joints is normal. MRI of the spine may also be useful in patients with severe pain in the spine of uncertain etiology and for assessment of disease activity.</p><p>MRI of the spine should cover the part of the spine with the most severe symptoms. For evaluating spondylitis, only the sagittal plane is necessary. The MRI slices should include the entirety of the vertebral bodies being imaged and the facet joints. The spinal lesions result in either BME observed with the STIR or the T2-weighted sequences with fat suppression, or areas of fatty deposition observed as high-intensity lesions in the T1-weighted sequences. A 2012 consensus of opinion on what spinal lesions on MRI are typical of spondylitis by the <span class=\"nowrap\">ASAS/Outcome</span> Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) MRI working group was that a positive spinal MRI for inflammation can be defined as the presence of anterior or posterior spondylitis in at least three sites, as the finding of single vertebral lesions is relatively nonspecific (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F96351\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96351 \">image 11</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

There is no single historical feature, physical finding, laboratory test, or imaging study with sufficient specificity by itself to establish the diagnosis without the presence of additional abnormalities.

The diagnosis of nr-axSpA could be made in a patient with all of these features, in the absence of positive SI joint findings on plain radiography, if typical abnormalities of sacroiliitis were detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the SI joints. Other findings can also contribute to making the diagnosis in patients who lack one, or even two, of the aforementioned features; however, the diagnosis is unlikely in the absence of all three of the typical findings (inflammatory back pain [IBP], HLA-B27, and imaging changes of sacroiliitis).

HLA-B27 testing should be considered in patients suspected of having SpA, depending upon the level of suspicion of the diagnosis and the utility, availability, and cost of the test in the geographical region and practice setting; the results of such testing should be interpreted in the context of the other features of axSpA that are present.

Based upon additional studies, the modification of the 2004 Berlin algorithm was subsequently developed to provide cost-effective guidance for rheumatologists to assess whether an individual patient referred for evaluation could be diagnosed as having axSpA; this version of the algorithm has been referred to as the 2013 ASAS modified Berlin algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F96353\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96353 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The modified algorithm has both a sensitivity and specificity of about 75 to 80 percent for axSpA among European patients with back pain &ge;3 months but &le;2 years, and pain onset &lt;45 years of age; thus, it provides only a general guideline for diagnosis of individual patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H140374333\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional diagnostic considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stringent adherence to our diagnostic approach (see <a href=\"#H140373911\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above) would lead to about 10 percent false-positive and 10 percent false-negative diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], and additional factors should always be considered in the diagnostic assessment to increase diagnostic accuracy, particularly in patients without the triad of IBP, HLA-B27, and sacroiliitis on plain radiographs of the pelvis.</p><p>Diagnostic uncertainty remains in some patients despite the use of extensive testing. In patients in whom the diagnosis cannot be made with confidence, a definitive conclusion should be avoided, and a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; policy regarding the diagnosis and symptomatic treatment with regular follow-up assessments will usually be the most appropriate approach.

In addition, it is important to remember that the results of such testing alone are neither diagnostic, in the case of positive testing, nor do they exclude the diagnosis, in the case of negative testing, but should be interpreted in the full clinical context.

Certain conditions are more commonly confused with axSpA, although the wide variety of conditions associated with low back pain should be considered in patients presenting with this symptom. The evaluation of the patient with low back pain is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major entities that should be considered in the differential diagnosis for axSpA include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute or chronic mechanical back pain</strong> &ndash; Mechanical back pain or back strain may occur with or without associated detectable anatomic abnormalities and can mimic axSpA.

These are generally able to be readily distinguished from axSpA by the absence of inflammatory characteristics in the majority of patients together with not being associated with the other features of SpA.

However, the pattern of pain is not typical of inflammatory back pain (IBP), fibromyalgia tender points can usually be distinguished from enthesitis with a thorough musculoskeletal examination, and patients with fibromyalgia lack the imaging changes or elevated acute phase response of SpA. In addition, a response to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is infrequently seen or only modest when present, unlike the good response typical of many patients with axSpA. On the other hand, fibromyalgia can coexist with SpA in about 10 percent of patients with axSpA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

However, unlike patients with axSpA, the SI joints are usually spared, the apophyseal joints are not ankylosed, exuberant osteophyte formation and flowing calcification occur, at least four contiguous vertebral bodies are typically ossified, and disc height is maintained. There may also be extraspinal involvement with hyperostosis noted in the region of the olecranon, patella, calcaneus, shoulder, and acetabulum.

It is sometimes confused with sacroiliitis. Radiographic findings show a typical pattern of sclerosis that is often confined to the iliac side of the SI joint but can also be found in other parts. The SI joints do not show erosions or fusion, but patients, especially women who have given birth, might have chronic back pain for mechanical reasons.

Erosive osteochondrosis can be distinguished from axSpA by characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, the lack of other features typical of SpA, and normal imaging findings of the SI joints.

(See <a href=\"#H97035242\" class=\"local\">'Nomenclature and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>axSpA, including both AS and nr-axSpA, can generally be diagnosed based upon the recognition of a pattern of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings characteristic of axSpA, including chronic back pain, sacroiliitis on imaging, and the presence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 and other features; the likelihood of the diagnosis varies depending upon the specific findings that are present. There is no single historical feature, physical finding, laboratory test, or imaging study with sufficient specificity by itself to establish the diagnosis without the presence of additional abnormalities.

A diagnosis of AS can be made in such patients if the image meets criteria for sacroiliitis (at least grade 2 bilaterally or grade 3 unilaterally) and at least one additional characteristic feature of SpA is positive in the assessment of the patient.
