Increasingly, however, patients are asking for and being offered a broader approach to carrier screening, which is possible because of rapid advancements in genetic testing technologies and decreasing costs. Although the information from expanded carrier screening can inform patient and provider decision-making, it can also present practical and ethical challenges that need to be considered.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues related to expanded carrier screening in women planning pregnancy or who are pregnant. Genetic screening in specific populations and for specific conditions are reviewed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carrier screening for genetic disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Overview of prenatal screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening and diagnosis for fragile X syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Carrier screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4082299178\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS EXPANDED CARRIER SCREENING?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expanded carrier screening refers to the practice of simultaneously screening for a large number of conditions in a panethnic approach (ie, without regard to race or ethnicity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expanded-carrier-screening-in-pregnant-women-and-women-planning-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Commercial laboratories offer test panels that screen for four to over 1700 diseases, which are not selected based on <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> background. The majority of conditions are autosomal-recessive, but some may be X-linked or autosomal-dominant single gene disorders. </p><p>The disorders that a laboratory decides to include in a panel is generally based on gene frequency and inclusion of mutations within a disorder that contribute to the highest detection of carriers. With a gene panel, the possibly of missing a mutation is influenced by how often the disorder occurs in a particular ethnicity or race, as well as how many of the disease-producing mutations are known in this gene and in this population. However, companies may add mutations or disorders to a panel because of influence from advocacy groups or the desire to provide the largest panel. As a result, the panel may include mutations for which there is little supportive data other than a single published report. </p><p>One study found that the number of recessive genes on a panel ranged from 40 to 1556 among the 16 laboratory panels that they reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expanded-carrier-screening-in-pregnant-women-and-women-planning-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Even when multiple laboratories included the same disease gene on their panel, substantial differences existed in the mutations screened for <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> variant <span class=\"nowrap\">interpretation/reporting</span> strategies. Only three recessive disease genes (cystic fibrosis, maple syrup urine disease 1b, and Niemann&ndash;Pick disease) were consistently screened for by all of the laboratories.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1055967016\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two primary laboratory techniques for testing are (1) targeted high-throughput mutation analysis for specific mutations known to be associated with a particular disease and (2) sequence analysis via next-generation methodologies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H596212854\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE AND GOAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for expanded carrier screening is that the majority of carrier individuals have no family history of the genetic condition(s) that they carry; therefore, they are unaware of their reproductive risk for transmitting the condition(s) to offspring. In addition, many individuals are of a multiethnic background or not aware of their full ancestry or true ethnicity.</p><p>The goal is to identify individuals at risk of transmitting a heritable disorder to offspring; provide appropriate prenatal counseling, prenatal care, and newborn management of a potentially affected child; and enhance the woman's reproductive autonomy (eg, preconception planning, prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy management).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1166737332\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3945478029\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of carriers regardless of race/ethnicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic conditions do not occur solely in specific ethnic groups. Furthermore, it is increasingly difficult to assign a single ethnicity to individuals in the United States and in some other countries. For example, up to 12 percent of infants born with a hemoglobinopathy identified via newborn testing in California in the 1990s did not belong to one of the groups targeted by the then-contemporary American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) ethnic-based carrier screening guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expanded-carrier-screening-in-pregnant-women-and-women-planning-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the largest observational study of routine recessive disease carrier screening (n = a multiethnic population of 23,453 individuals), 76 percent of carriers would have been missed by ACOG's traditional ethnic-based guideline in place at the time the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expanded-carrier-screening-in-pregnant-women-and-women-planning-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. With panethnic screening, 24 percent of individuals were identified as carriers for at least one disorder and 5.2 percent were carriers for multiple disorders on the 108 disorder panel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1791012514\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of a wide range of genetic conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A single laboratory test can screen for hundreds of Mendelian disorders simultaneously. Mendelian disorders account for 20 percent of infant mortality and 18 percent of infant hospitalizations in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expanded-carrier-screening-in-pregnant-women-and-women-planning-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Preconception or prenatal identification of carriers could lead to reduction in diagnostic cost and time, earlier treatment, avoidance of unnecessary treatments, and prevention of disease in offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expanded-carrier-screening-in-pregnant-women-and-women-planning-pregnancy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Screening for hundreds of disorders in one test could provide a potentially cost-effective means of identifying carriers for rare Mendelian disorders in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expanded-carrier-screening-in-pregnant-women-and-women-planning-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102388380\"><span class=\"h1\">HARMS AND LIMITATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No uniform or standardized process has been identified for best practice in expanded carrier screening. Furthermore, there are no data demonstrating an improvement in reproductive outcome, despite the benefits described above.</p><p>For these reasons, individual and consensus statements of major professional organizations in the United States, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, the National Society of Genetic Counselors, and the Perinatal Quality Foundation do not recommend expanded carrier screening as a substitute for traditional carrier screening, while acknowledging the specific benefits described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expanded-carrier-screening-in-pregnant-women-and-women-planning-pregnancy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Individual patients, however, may desire this information based on personal values and preferences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343204477\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of conditions of limited impact, uncertain prevalence, or poorly defined phenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">preconception/prenatal</span> panels that commercial laboratories offer for expanded screening include some conditions that result in only mild to moderate (rather that severe) health complications (eg, factor V Leiden), have significant variations in or poorly defined phenotype (eg, fragile X), or have onset in adulthood (eg, <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/2</em>-mutation</span> testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer). The frequency of some conditions is unknown in the general population or within specific ethnic groups, rendering calculation of residual risk after a positive test inconclusive.</p><p>Including these types of conditions in a screening panel is in direct conflict with accepted clinical criteria for screening programs. Guidelines typically recommend screening for conditions with a well-defined genotype and phenotype, a high carrier frequency that is known within the screened population, a deleterious effect on quality of life (eg, causing cognitive or physical impairment, requiring significant surgical treatment or medical throughout life, decreased life expectancy), or have a fetal, neonatal, or early childhood onset amenable to prenatal diagnosis, and ideally potential <span class=\"nowrap\">antenatal/postnatal</span> intervention to improve outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expanded-carrier-screening-in-pregnant-women-and-women-planning-pregnancy/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3280586381\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a screening panel'</a> below). In a 2017 review of conditions included on commercial expanded carrier screening panels available in the United States, only 27 percent of the conditions included in the panels overall met these criteria for inclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expanded-carrier-screening-in-pregnant-women-and-women-planning-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Use of suboptimal panels may have downstream costs for additional laboratory testing or sequencing, increases the time and complexity of counseling, and thus may increase patient anxiety.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H575021813\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of variants of uncertain clinical significance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sequencing technologies may identify variants of uncertain clinical significance. Variants of uncertain clinical significance are more likely to be identified if the laboratory performs diagnostic sequencing in lieu of screening for specific mutations. Although most laboratories do not reveal variants of uncertain significance in clinical reports, this practice is not uniform and without any oversight. These variants create patient anxiety despite counseling, which is complex and time-consuming.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2231099496\"><span class=\"h2\">Lack of detection of private mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Targeted high-throughput mutation analysis for specific mutations known to be associated with a particular disease has the potential to miss mutations that are private or unique within a family or ethnic group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2408098224\"><span class=\"h1\">PRE- AND POST-TEST COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pre- and post-test counseling are essential to the process of carrier testing in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H673386214\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral to a provider with genetics expertise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with risk factors for genetic conditions are often best served by referral to a provider with genetics expertise, in order to meet the patient's need for information and the obstetric provider's workflow pressures in the office.
