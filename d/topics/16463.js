In the United States Third National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES III), which excluded subjects with known thyroid disease, 4.3 percent of 16,533 people had subclinical hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

However, the prevalence is determined by the upper limit of normal for serum TSH. If the upper limit of normal rises with age, as appears to be the case, then the prevalence may not be as high as has been previously thought. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In Europe, where iodine intake is variable, subclinical hypothyroidism is more prevalent in areas of iodine sufficiency. In one study, the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism ranged from 4.2 percent in iodine-deficient areas to 23.9 percent in an area of abundant iodine intake, despite a similar prevalence of patients with high serum concentrations of antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of subclinical hypothyroidism are the same as those of overt hypothyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73266\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73266 \">table 1</a>).

Other major causes include prior ablative or antithyroid drug therapy for hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease; prior partial thyroidectomy; external radiation therapy in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, or brain tumors; inadequate T4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>) replacement therapy for overt hypothyroidism; and drugs impairing thyroid function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2190176869\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism have serum TSH levels &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> and are asymptomatic. In particular, older patients with subclinical hypothyroidism appear to be asymptomatic, although many euthyroid older individuals also have symptoms that might be construed as being related to hypothyroidism, including dry skin, constipation, and low energy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In a population-based, prospective study of 558 individuals in the Netherlands who were screened for hypothyroidism during the month of their 85<sup>th</sup> birthday and again three years later, 5 percent had subclinical hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. At baseline, there was no association between baseline serum TSH concentration and cognitive function, depressive symptoms, or disability in activities of daily living. Although measures of performance declined over time, increased serum TSH at baseline was associated with a slower decline in ability to perform activities such as preparing one's own meals, shopping for groceries and personal items, managing one's money, using the telephone, and doing housework. In another community-based study of individuals &ge;65 years, subclinical hypothyroidism was not associated with depression, anxiety, or cognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Some patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, however, may have vague, nonspecific symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and constipation, but attempts to identify patients clinically have not been successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism is based upon biochemical testing alone. </p><p>Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal serum free T4</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated TSH</p><p/><p>It may occur in the presence or absence of mild symptoms of hypothyroidism. </p><p>In most circumstances, the initial screening test for thyroid disease is the serum TSH. If the serum TSH concentration is elevated, the TSH measurement should be repeated along with a serum free T4 before making the diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism. Because the serum TSH concentration can be transiently elevated, a serum TSH measurement should be repeated after one to three months to confirm the diagnosis. An exception, however, is pregnant women or women undergoing infertility evaluation or treatment, in whom a TSH and free T4 should be repeated immediately and T4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>) treatment started if an elevated TSH is confirmed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H57693666\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Indications for treatment'</a>.)</p><p>For nonpregnant adults, an elevated serum TSH is defined as a TSH concentration above the upper limit of the normal TSH reference range, which is typically 4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> in most laboratories. There is considerable controversy over the appropriate upper limit of normal for serum TSH. Some experts have suggested that the true upper limit is only 2.5 or 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> in healthy individuals without thyroid disease, while others argue that the serum TSH distribution shifts towards higher values with age, independent of the presence of antithyroid antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In this case, the upper limit of normal could be as high as 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> in healthy octogenarians. This topic is reviewed in detail separately.

Rarely, heterophilic antibodies block binding of one of the mouse monoclonal antibodies to TSH and result in spuriously low readings for TSH. Nonlinearity of the serum TSH concentration with dilution of the patient's serum suggests interference.
