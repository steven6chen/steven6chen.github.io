As waste products and fluids build up in the body, other body systems are affected, which can be harmful to your health.</p><p>The most common causes of CKD are diabetes and high blood pressure. In the early stages of CKD, there are no symptoms. The disease can progress to complete kidney failure, also called end-stage <span class=\"nowrap\">renal/kidney</span> disease. This occurs when kidney function has worsened to the point that dialysis or kidney transplantation is required to maintain good health and even life.</p><p>The main goal of treatment is to <strong>prevent</strong> progression of CKD to complete kidney failure. The best way to do this is to diagnose CKD early and control the underlying cause.</p><p>The symptoms, evaluation, and management of CKD will be reviewed here. Kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis, and hemodialysis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-or-kidney-transplantation-which-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Dialysis or kidney transplantation &mdash; which is right for me? (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hemodialysis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL KIDNEY FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A brief overview of normal kidney function can help in the understanding of CKD. The kidneys function to remove wastes and excess water from the blood. These wastes and fluids are combined to form urine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80336\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80336 \">figure 1</a>). Many vital body functions are dependent upon the proper functioning of the kidneys. The kidneys also control the amount of sodium, potassium, phosphorous, calcium, and other chemicals in the body.</p><p>In order for this filtering process to occur properly, the blood pressure and blood flow to the kidneys must be adequate. If the arteries leading to the kidney are diseased, the filtering process will be affected. Filtering of the blood is done in the kidney by structures called &quot;nephrons.&quot; The nephrons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82497\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82497 \">figure 2</a>), including the glomeruli and the tubules, must be healthy, and the path from the nephron to the urethra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 3</a>) must not be blocked. There are normally approximately 700 thousand to 1 million filtering units or nephrons in each kidney. Diseases that reduce the number of normally functioning nephrons <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduce the function of nephrons cause CKD over time.</p><p>When the kidney filters are working properly, the result is a proper balance of fluids and chemicals in the body. If an imbalance occurs, many critical bodily functions can be affected, possibly producing symptoms associated with kidney disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Chronic kidney disease complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors can increase the risk of developing CKD, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A family history of kidney disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>African-American and other ethnic minorities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having protein in the urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having autoimmune diseases such as lupus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with CKD do not have symptoms until the kidney function is severely impaired. The problem is often discovered when blood or urine tests done for other reasons show one or more of the abnormalities discussed above. The blood test that is most commonly used to check the level of kidney function is the creatinine concentration. As kidney function goes down, the creatinine concentration in the blood goes up. The most common urine tests are for protein or albumin in the urine. Sometimes, people with CKD will develop swelling, most commonly around the feet and ankles, before any other symptoms appear.</p><p>Even when kidney failure is advanced, most people still make a normal or near-normal amount of urine; this is sometimes confusing. Urine is being formed, but it does not contain sufficient amounts of the body's waste products.</p><p>With advanced kidney disease, you may develop edema (swelling of the feet, ankles, or legs), loss of appetite, increased sleepiness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and difficulty thinking. Patients often develop high blood pressure, blood chemistry (electrolyte) abnormalities such as a high potassium concentration, anemia (a decrease in red blood cells, which can cause fatigue and other symptoms), and bone disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edema-swelling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Edema (swelling) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Uremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with advanced kidney failure may develop a group of symptoms referred to as <strong>uremia</strong>. The symptoms of uremia include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, a build-up of fluid around the heart, nerve problems, and changes in mental status, including drowsiness, seizures, or coma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A health care provider may use several tests to diagnose CKD and determine if there is a treatable underlying cause. These include the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) gives an approximate measure of the number of functioning nephrons. GFR is used to monitor the severity of kidney impairment. Actually measuring GFR is difficult and not practical in the care of most patients. Instead, GFR is usually estimated. The most common way to estimate the GFR in adults is by measuring the creatinine level in the blood stream and then using this number to calculate an estimated GFR (eGFR) level. This eGFR level is often shown on routine blood chemistry lab reports that your doctor obtains. A measure of kidney function can also be obtained by collecting a 24-hour urine sample and measuring the concentration of creatinine in the blood and urine. The blood urea nitrogen level is also commonly measured with blood tests and, like the blood creatinine concentration, generally goes up as kidney function declines.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in GFR implies either worsening of the underlying kidney disease or the development of another, occasionally reversible kidney problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in GFR, on the other hand, indicates improvement in kidney function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stable GFR in people with CKD implies stable disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of albumin or protein in the urine (called albuminuria or proteinuria) is a marker of kidney disease. Even small amounts of albumin in the urine may be an early sign of CKD in some people, particularly those with diabetes and high blood pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-in-the-urine-proteinuria-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Protein in the urine (proteinuria) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging tests (such as computed tomography [CT] or ultrasound) may be recommended to determine if there are any obstructions (blockages) of the urinary tract, kidney stones, or other abnormalities, such as many large cysts seen in a genetic disease called polycystic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a kidney biopsy, a small piece of kidney tissue is removed and examined under a microscope. The biopsy helps to identify abnormalities in kidney tissue that may be the cause of kidney diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-kidney-biopsy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Renal (kidney) biopsy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the treatment of CKD is to determine the underlying cause. Some causes are reversible, including use of medications that impair kidney function, blockage in the urinary tract, or decreased blood flow to the kidneys. Treatment of reversible causes may prevent CKD from worsening.</p><p>Research has shown that management of CKD is best done with the assistance of a nephrologist, a doctor who specializes in kidney diseases. Early referral to a nephrologist decreases the chance of developing complications associated with CKD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is present in 80 to 85 percent of people with CKD. Maintaining good blood pressure control is the most important goal for trying to slow the progression of CKD. Taking a medication called an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) reduces blood pressure and levels of protein in the urine and is thought to slow the progression of CKD to a greater extent than some of the other medicines used to treat high blood pressure.</p><p>Sometimes, a diuretic (water pill) or other medication is also added. You may be asked to monitor your blood pressure at home to be sure that your blood pressure is well controlled. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with CKD are at risk for anemia. This occurs because improperly functioning kidneys produce reduced amounts of a substance called erythropoietin. Anemia can lead to fatigue and other complications.</p><p>Selected patients can be treated with drugs that stimulate production of red blood cells. You or a family member may be able to inject these drugs at home. In some cases, iron supplements are also prescribed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in your diet may be recommended to control or prevent some of the complications of CKD; most important is salt restriction to help control the blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restricting protein in the diet may slow the progression of CKD, although it is not clear if the benefits of protein restriction are worth the difficulty of sticking to a low-protein diet. Although a reduced-protein diet may delay dialysis for several years, the unappetizing nature of the diet is difficult for most people to tolerate. Speak to your health care provider about the advantages and disadvantages of a low-protein diet. Some people may benefit from a plant-based diet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary recommendations for patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Potassium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with CKD develop a high blood potassium level, which can interfere with normal cell function. This is frequently treated with a diuretic. Measures to prevent high potassium might also be recommended, including a low-potassium diet and avoiding medicines that raise potassium levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-potassium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low-potassium diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Phosphate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phosphate is a mineral that helps to keep the bones healthy. Early in the course of CKD, the body begins to retain phosphate. As the disease progresses, high blood phosphate levels can develop. This is usually treated with medicines that prevent phosphate (found in foods) from being absorbed in the digestive tract. Dietary phosphate restrictions are also recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79877%7EPI%2F56081\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79877 graphicRef56081 \">table 1A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholesterol and triglycerides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High cholesterol and triglyceride levels are common in people with kidney disease. High triglycerides have been associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, which can lead to heart attack.</p><p>Treatments to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease are usually recommended, including dietary changes, medications for high triglyceride and cholesterol levels, stopping smoking, and tight blood sugar control in people with diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (hyperlipidemia) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Self-monitoring of blood glucose in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men and women with advanced CKD often have difficulties with sexual function and infertility. Over 50 percent of men with end-stage kidney disease have difficulties with erection and decreased sex drive. Women often have disturbances in the menstrual cycle and fertility, usually leading to a stop in menstrual periods. Decreased sex drive may also occur in women.</p><p>You should discuss any changes in your sexual function with your health care provider because medications or other treatments may be effective. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-men-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Sexual problems in men (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Sexual problems in women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk that pregnancy will worsen kidney function or that decreased kidney function will interfere with pregnancy depends upon a number of factors. A woman with mild to moderate CKD who is considering becoming pregnant should discuss the possible risks with her nephrologist and obstetrical provider before trying to conceive.</p><p>Women with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis and who become pregnant are at increased risk for miscarriage, premature delivery, severe hypertension, and preeclampsia. A woman who undergoes successful renal transplantation has a lower risk of these complications. It may be advantageous for a woman to delay becoming pregnant while on hemodialysis if renal transplantation in the near future is likely. Hemodialysis may need to be done six to seven times per week during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARING FOR DIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with CKD progressively worsen over time and will eventually need dialysis or a kidney transplant. There are two types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Kidney transplantation is also an option for some people with CKD even before ever starting dialysis. Patients should talk with their doctors about getting an evaluation for a kidney transplant long before they are getting close to needing dialysis.</p><p>An important component of treatment for patients with CKD is planning for dialysis in advance. Although kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice in most cases, many people must wait months or years for a kidney to become available. Dialysis will likely be needed, often for an extended period.</p><p>Dialysis and kidney transplantation are discussed in detail separately.
