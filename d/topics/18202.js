The overall incidence and epidemiology of these tumors are illustrated by an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry from 1973 to 2006, which identified 6739 nonlymphoreticular malignancies arising in the nasal cavity and accessory sinuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall incidence rate was 0.56 cases per 100,000 population per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nasal cavity was the most common primary site, followed by the maxillary sinus (44 and 36 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal cavity tumors were more common in males than females, with a 1.8:1 ratio.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients were diagnosed in the sixth decade of life or later, and the racial distribution was similar to that of the general population.</p><p/><p>Risk factors associated with nasal cavity tumors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tobacco smoke, which is a major risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occupational and chronic exposures to inhaled wood dusts, glues, and adhesives have been associated with sinonasal adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Persons with occupational exposure to wood dusts have a 500- to 900-fold increased risk of developing sinonasal adenocarcinoma compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A National Cancer Database study identified human papillomavirus (HPV) infection as a significant risk factor in patients with sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma for 32 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In this study, HPV positivity was associated with improved five-year overall survival compared with HPV negative tumors (68.1 versus 51.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800270\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An understanding of the anatomy of the nasal cavity is essential for the proper evaluation, staging, and treatment of patients with a nasal cavity tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67813\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67813 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Proximally, the nasal cavity is separated from the nasal vestibule (the hair-bearing portion of the nose) by the limen nasi and posteriorly by the choanae; it is bounded by the hard palate inferiorly and by the skull base (frontal bone, cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and sphenoid bone) superiorly. The nasal cavity is separated into halves by the nasal septum and is bounded laterally by the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.</p><p>Anatomic communication between the nasal cavity and adjacent structures can serve as a conduit for tumor spread:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choanae connect the nasal cavity to the nasopharynx.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional communications are located in the lateral walls of the nasal cavity deep to three paired turbinates (or concha).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The nasolacrimal duct courses through the maxilla and terminates in the inferior meatus lateral to the inferior turbinate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The middle meatus is lateral to the middle turbinate and serves as the terminus for outflow from the frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoid sinuses. From anterior to posterior, the uncinate process of the ethmoid bone and the ethmoid bulla form the semilunar hiatus, which contains the infundibulum that leads to the frontal recess, frontal sinus, and the openings to the anterior ethmoid air cells. The ostia of the maxillary sinus lie posteriorly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The sphenopalatine foramen is the most posterior opening in the middle meatus and forms the communication between the nasal cavity, and the pterygopalatine fossa and infratemporal fossa. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The ostial openings to the posterior ethmoid air cells are in the superior meatus deep to the superior turbinate.</p><p/><p>The proximity of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses to critical skull base structures, including the brain, eyes, cranial nerves, and visual pathways, makes local management of nasal cavity tumors challenging. Most nasal cavity tumors are diagnosed at a locally advanced stage and cross tissue boundaries, including the paranasal sinuses, orbits, and skull base structures. At least 50 percent of patients have involvement of more than one anatomic subsite. Orbital invasion was identified in 11 percent of a series of 876 patients with sinonasal malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Cranial nerves can serve as conduits for tumor spread in as many as one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800277\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common histology of nasal cavity tumors, but nonsquamous histologies are more likely in the nasal cavity than in the mucosa of other head and neck sites.<strong> </strong>These include adenocarcinoma and its variants (mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma, adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified, and acinic cell carcinoma), neuroendocrine tumors (olfactory neuroblastoma, also referred to as esthesioneuroblastoma; sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma; and small cell carcinoma), and mucosal melanoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of head and neck neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several distinct histologic entities have been described, including nuclear protein testis (NUT) midline carcinoma and <em>SMARCB1</em> (<em>INI-1</em>)-deficient sinonasal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], both of which require molecular analysis for confirmation and have likely historically been characterized as poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. However, unlike squamous cell carcinoma of the sinonasal region, these entities tend to present with very advanced disease and have a much less favorable prognosis.</p><p>In a population-based study of 3329 patients with sinonasal malignancies, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and olfactory neuroblastoma accounted for 48, 15, 8, and 3 percent of cases, respectively, while miscellaneous tumor types or unknown histology accounted for the remainder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800284\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with nasal cavity carcinoma present with symptoms of locally advanced disease; these include nasal obstruction and epistaxis (71 and 42 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In more advanced disease, presenting symptoms can be due to involvement of adjacent structures, such as facial <span class=\"nowrap\">swelling/pain,</span> proptosis, diplopia, cranial nerve dysfunction, seizure, and nodal masses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800291\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800298\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with nasal cavity tumors require a thorough history and physical examination, along with a complete head and neck examination including nasal endoscopy. This should include assessment of cranial nerves, ophthalmologic function, audiometry, and neck exams.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800305\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An adequate biopsy specimen for histopathology is required to accurately diagnose and classify nasal cavity tumors. Tumor biopsies are usually obtained endoscopically with sinus surgery instruments. In some cases, a fine needle aspirate biopsy may be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800312\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies, including both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are important to evaluate the extent of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50420\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50420 \">image 1</a>). </p><p>The imaging findings with early stage sinonasal tumors are similar to those of rhinosinusitis and may easily be confused with benign pathology. However, unilateral sinus opacification and bone destruction are important signs that may indicate the presence of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Imaging of sinonasal tumors requires intravenous contrast to delineate the extent of tumor involvement, unlike imaging for benign rhinosinusitis. CT and MRI provide complementary information about the extent of local-regional disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT is the best modality to evaluate bony changes, such as cortical bone erosion, destruction, remodeling, sclerosis, and reactive thickening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI is used to characterize the soft tissue components of the tumor and to evaluate the extent of tumor invasion beyond the bony structures, especially the orbital, intracranial, and perineural extension of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. T2-weighted images are especially useful in distinguishing benign opacities from tumors. Fat suppression is critical in the evaluation of perineural disease and orbital invasion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the diagnosis of cancer has been established, neck imaging is indicated to evaluate for lymph node metastasis, with careful attention to the retropharyngeal lymph nodes as well as level 1b and 2a cervical lymph node stations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of positron emission tomography (PET)-CT imaging is less clear for nasal cavity cancers, although it may be helpful in detecting retropharyngeal or cervical lymph node involvement. PET-CT may also be particularly useful in detecting distant metastases in patients with olfactory neuroblastoma or mucosal melanoma. As an example, in a series of 28 patients undergoing staging evaluation for olfactory neuroblastoma, the addition of PET-CT to standard imaging changed or altered the clinical management of 39 percent of patients, mostly due to upstaging by detecting a cervical lymph node or distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In the follow-up of patients previously treated for olfactory neuroblastoma, PET-CT detected 75 percent of recurrences. The remaining 25 percent of patients were PET-CT negative, and recurrences were detected on endoscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI. The authors concluded that PET-CT alone is helpful in follow-up but does not negate the need for MRI and endoscopic evaluation for adequate detection of recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800319\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasal cavity tumors are staged according to the American Joint Committee on <span class=\"nowrap\">Cancer&nbsp;(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC)&nbsp;tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110768 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Staging is based upon both the visual assessment of the extent of disease and imaging studies. In the eighth edition of the AJCC staging system, the only change in the staging of nasal cavity tumors includes the reclassification of patients with clinical or pathological extranodal extension (ENE) as N3b, which is uncommon in nasal cavity tumors. Of note, this change is only applicable to patients with non-human papillomavirus (HPV) related cancers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800326\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment recommendations for patients with nasal cavity cancers are based on observational case series since there are no randomized trials that have compared treatment alternatives. Furthermore, many retrospective studies have combined nasal cavity tumors with paranasal sinus tumors, making it difficult to draw conclusions that are specific to nasal cavity cancers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800333\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aggressive management of the primary tumor is critical since local disease and extension into adjacent structures are the major causes of morbidity and mortality. Regional lymph node disease and distant metastases are primarily seen with late presentation or progressive disease.</p><p>The initial patient management should be planned by a multidisciplinary team that includes head and neck surgeons, neurosurgeons with skull base expertise, and radiation oncologists. Most patients with nasal cavity tumors are managed with a multidisciplinary approach that includes both surgery and radiation therapy (RT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The role of systemic therapy in local-regional disease is less clear. There is a significant risk of local recurrence when patients are managed with surgery alone, and the proximity of the brain and eye make treatment with high doses of RT problematic.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The standard treatment for advanced-stage tumors is surgery followed by postoperative RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although preoperative RT has been used to minimize tumor bulk and limit the extent of resection, postoperative RT is generally preferred to minimize the risk of wound complications following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery alone is a reasonable option for some carefully selected patients with T1N0 tumors; however, such early stage disease is rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unresectable tumors are treated with definitive RT. The role of chemotherapy in this setting is uncertain, and there are no data from randomized trials. In a large meta-analysis examining the outcomes of 701 patients with sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma, the addition of chemotherapy did not improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Based upon results that are largely derived from the squamous subtype of other head and neck cancers, cisplatin-based chemotherapy concurrently with RT is generally used for good performance status patients with unresectable, extensive lesions. Induction chemotherapy might be considered if significant tumor reduction would allow for more favorable radiation fields with less potential for significant morbidity to structures such as the eye, brain, or swallowing apparatus. There are only limited data on whether this applies to tumors of the nasal cavity, especially with nonsquamous histology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=locally-advanced-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck-approaches-combining-chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Approaches combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800340\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of surgery is the complete resection of all visible disease while preserving function and cosmesis. Widely negative margins are not achievable in most cases, given the anatomic constraints.</p><p>There are no definitive criteria that define resectability for tumors of the nasal cavity. Tumors that invade the cavernous sinus, involve the optic <span class=\"nowrap\">chiasm/both</span> optic nerves, or extend transdurally are generally considered to be unresectable without causing unacceptable morbidity and loss of function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Neck dissection is typically performed only in cases with clinically positive nodes.</p><p>Historically, the most common surgical techniques for exposure of the nasal cavity have been lateral rhinotomy, midface degloving procedures, and craniofacial resection when tumors involved the fovea ethmoidalis, cribriform plate, and intracranial structures. These approaches allow adequate visualization of tumors and en bloc resection. However, these open craniofacial approaches can be disfiguring and can be associated with high rates of morbidity.</p><p>Advances in surgical techniques, hemostatic materials, and intraoperative image guidance have led to the development of endonasal endoscopic approaches used alone or in combination with a craniotomy. These endoscopic techniques are now preferred when a gross total resection is achievable by endoscopic approach and appropriate surgical (otorhinolaryngology, neurosurgery) expertise is available.</p><p>Typically, endoscopic techniques require a piecemeal resection of the tumor with liberal use of frozen-section pathology. This method was initially criticized as oncologically unsound. However, a growing body of literature suggests that endoscopic surgery does not compromise oncologic control or survival, and there is significantly less operative morbidity compared with traditional craniofacial resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/25-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-32</a>]. However, most patients with advanced disease undergo craniofacial resection for tumor that is not amenable to gross total excision by an endoscopic approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800347\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800354\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT is an important component of local-regional management for patients with nasal cavity tumors.

Hyperfractionation has a hypothetical advantage when treating with high-dose RT in this part of the body where the high-risk target volume is often in close proximity or overlapping the visual pathways. A lower dose per fraction may reduce the risk of toxicity to the visual pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients treated postoperatively, the typical dose for low-risk microscopic residual disease is 60 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction, whereas high-risk postoperative patients (who have received a gross total resection with positive margins) are treated to between 66 and 70 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800368\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT management of head and neck malignancies requires three-dimensional (3D)-conformal techniques.

However, other modern IMRT series still demonstrate the ongoing challenge in achieving adequate local control. In a series of 122 patients with primary and recurrent sinonasal cancers, of which 99 were treated with postoperative RT, three-year and five-year local control rates were only 60 and 51 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>There is increasing interest in particle therapy (primarily protons) in the management of sinonasal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>], primarily because the unique properties of the Bragg Peak allow for a more favorable dose distribution compared with IMRT.

This analysis included data from 41 observational studies with 1472 patients (286 treated with particle therapy and 1186 treated with photon therapy). The patient characteristics were similar between the two groups except that high-grade histologies were more common in patients treated with photon therapy compared with those managed with particle therapy (50 versus 27 percent). Charged particle therapy was significantly more effective in terms of overall survival, local-regional control, and disease-free survival. There was a nonsignificant trend toward less ocular toxicity with particle therapy compared with IMRT, but there was a significant increase in overall neurologic toxicity. </p><p>The results with proton therapy are illustrated by two relatively large series of patients treated for sinonasal cancer. In one series of 84 patients (high-grade histologies in 51 percent, locally advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">T3/4</span> disease 94 percent), most patients underwent surgical resection prior to proton therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Nearly all were treated with a dose-intensified hyperfractionated regimen (median dose, 73.8 Gy relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) with concurrent chemotherapy. Local control, neck control, freedom from distant metastasis, disease-free survival, cause-specific survival, and overall survival rates were 83, 94, 73, 63, 70, and 68 percent, respectively, at three&nbsp;years. Proton therapy after gross total resection resulted in a 90 percent three-year local control rate. In a second series of 54 patients treated with proton therapy for sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma, the five-year local control rate was 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800375\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general approach to treatment planning for external beam RT is discussed separately.

In addition, communication from the surgeon is important, especially after piecemeal endoscopic resection, where margin status may have less meaning than surgeon assessment of at-risk regions. Treatment fields should encompass any residual disease (gross tumor volume), the intermediate-risk target volume (entire operative bed and areas at risk for microscopic spread of disease at the primary site), and a margin to account for uncertainties in target localization and inherent to the treatment planning process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267800382\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of the neck</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymph node metastases are present at diagnosis in 10 to 20 percent of patients with squamous cell carcinoma but are less common in other histologic variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/7,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,51,52</a>]. Elective neck management (either neck dissection or RT) is generally indicated for patients with T3-4 N0 M0 squamous cell carcinoma and other high-grade histologies of the nasal cavity. In the absence of clinically positive adenopathy, elective neck management can be avoided in low-grade T1-2 N0 M0 disease. </p><p>The results of elective neck management are illustrated by a series of 71 patients with olfactory neuroblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. With a median follow-up of 80 months, the rate of neck relapses among clinically negative (N0) patients was 18 percent. Elective neck irradiation was associated with significantly improved regional nodal control at five years compared with observation (100 percent versus 82 percent); however, there was no improvement in overall survival or disease-free survival. Of the 11 isolated neck recurrences, six were successfully salvaged with neck surgery and further RT.

However, routine scheduled follow-up evaluation for cancer surveillance should continue for five years. Recurrences beyond five years are most commonly encountered in histologies such as adenoid cystic carcinoma and olfactory neuroblastoma.</p><p>Follow-up should include a history and physical examination, including endoscopic evaluation of the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract to survey for both local disease recurrence and second primary head and neck malignancies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated for evaluation of local, skull base, perineural, and leptomeningeal recurrence as well as for evidence of radiation necrosis. Surveillance with computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT may be indicated for node-positive disease or in advanced cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, or mucosal melanoma. A CT or MRI obtained three to four months after treatment can serve as a baseline for future reference since, in postoperative patients, the anatomy is altered.
