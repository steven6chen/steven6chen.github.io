It occurs in approximately 25 percent of the population each year, but most affected people do not seek medical care. Approximately 25 percent of patients with dyspepsia have an underlying organic cause. However, up to 75 percent of patients have functional (idiopathic or nonulcer) dyspepsia with no underlying cause on diagnostic evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. This topic review will provide an overview of the pathophysiology and treatment of functional dyspepsia. </p><p>Our recommendations for the diagnosis and management of functional dyspepsia are largely consistent with the American College of Gastroenterology and American Gastroenterological Association guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The etiology, general approach to the evaluation, and management of the patient with uninvestigated dyspepsia are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with dyspepsia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1788386988\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of functional dyspepsia ranges from 5 to 11 percent worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia is not well understood. However, several potential mechanisms have been suggested. These mechanisms may differ between subtypes of functional dyspepsia (postprandial distress syndrome and epigastric pain syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2130903462\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastric motility and compliance</strong> &ndash; Functional dyspepsia has been associated with several motility disorders. These include mild delays in gastric emptying, rapid gastric emptying, antral hypomotility, gastric dysrhythmias, and impaired gastric accommodation in response to a meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. However, these findings are noted in only a subset of patients with dyspepsia. As examples, delayed gastric emptying and antral hypomotility are found in approximately 25 to 35 percent of patients with dyspepsia while up to 10 percent of patients with dyspepsia have rapid gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/3,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-14</a>].

Several studies have demonstrated visceral hypersensitivity in patients with functional dyspepsia that occurs independently of delayed gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. Both mechanoreceptor dysfunction and aberrant processing of afferent input in the spinal cord or brain may play a role in the pathophysiology of visceral hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In one study that included 270 patients with functional dyspepsia, 37 percent had hypersensitivity to gastric distension, and hypersensitive patients reported higher cumulative symptom scores as compared with normosensitive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients with functional dyspepsia may also have increased chemosensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>Helicobacter</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>pylori</em></strong> <strong>infection</strong> &ndash; Although there are several hypotheses with regard to the role of <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection in the pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia, the mechanism remains unclear. <em>H. pylori</em> may cause altered smooth muscle dysfunction due to the induction of an inflammatory response or by the initiation of an antibody response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, studies have not found an association between <em>H. pylori</em> and abnormal gastric motor function in patients with functional dyspepsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of and immune response to Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The inflammatory response induced by <em>H. pylori</em> may lower the discomfort threshold to gastric distension by causing alterations in the enteric or central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, in at least one study, <em>H. pylori</em> positive and negative patients with functional dyspepsia had no difference in the perception of mechanically-induced gastric distension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is evidence from randomized controlled trials that eradication of <em>H. pylori</em> results in relief of dyspepsia in a minority of patients. However, studies have failed to establish a temporal relationship between <em>H. pylori</em> infection and functional dyspepsia, or the association of <em>H. pylori</em> with a specific symptom complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Therefore, relief of dyspepsia may reflect other factors such as cure of unrecognized peptic ulcer disease in patients misdiagnosed with functional (nonulcer) dyspepsia, alterations in acid secretion, or changes in the gut microbiota.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Altered gut microbiome</strong> &ndash; Alterations in the upper gastrointestinal tract microbiome may result in the development of dyspepsia. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that dyspeptic symptoms are more likely to occur after an episode of gastroenteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. In one study, patients were noted to have persistent symptoms eight years after exposure to a waterborne outbreak of bacterial dysentery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. It has also been hypothesized that the efficacy of <em>H. pylori </em>therapy in improving symptoms of functional dyspepsia is due to the impact on the gut microbiome rather than the eradication of <em>H. pylori</em> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Duodenal inflammation</strong> &ndash; An association between functional dyspepsia and increased duodenal eosinophilia has been reported, with an increase in duodenal eosinophils in patients with early satiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>]. It is unclear if this upregulation in mucosal immunity is due to changes in the upper gut microbiome or diet. However, lower levels of duodenal eosinophilia can occur in a healthy population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychosocial</strong> <strong>dysfunction</strong> &ndash; Functional dyspepsia may result from a complex interaction of psychosocial and physiological factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Dyspepsia has been associated with generalized anxiety disorder, somatization, and major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/12,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,40-43</a>]. There is also a higher prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders in patients with self-reported history of childhood abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4244969612\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with functional dyspepsia usually describe postprandial fullness, early satiety, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> epigastric <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/burning</span>.

A clinical diagnosis of functional dyspepsia requires the fulfillment of symptom-based diagnostic criteria and an evaluation to exclude other causes of dyspepsia. This evaluation consists of a history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and endoscopic evaluation to exclude <span class=\"nowrap\">organic/structural</span> disease to explain the symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F115195\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115195 \">algorithm 1</a>). An approach to the evaluation of a patient with dyspepsia is discussed in detail separately.

Criteria for symptom frequency and duration are particularly useful in defining patient eligibility for research, but clinician judgement may allow diagnosis in practice without rigid adherence to them. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Functional dyspepsia subtypes</strong> &ndash; Two subtypes of functional dyspepsia are recognized based on the predominant symptoms. However, overlap between these subtypes is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/8,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,47</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Postprandial distress syndrome is characterized by bothersome postprandial fullness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> early satiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F108003\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108003 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Epigastric pain syndrome is characterized by bothersome epigastric pain or burning that is not exclusively postprandial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F108003\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108003 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1031150335\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of functional dyspepsia includes other organic causes of dyspepsia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90590\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90590 \">table 2</a>). Although there are several organic causes for dyspepsia, the main causes are peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced dyspepsia, and gastric malignancy. Functional dyspepsia is differentiated from these by clinical assessment, laboratory testing, and upper endoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia#H1915206322\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with dyspepsia&quot;, section on 'Dyspepsia secondary to organic disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</strong> &ndash; The most common symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease are retrosternal burning pain and regurgitation. Dyspepsia symptoms can coexist with heartburn, but in patients with functional dyspepsia, epigastric pain, and fullness are the predominant symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastroparesis</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Gastroparesis is less prevalent than functional dyspepsia, but may be confused with it, as gastric emptying may be slow and symptoms of dyspepsia occur in both disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Patients with functional dyspepsia may have nausea. However, in patients with gastroparesis, vomiting, rather than abdominal pain or epigastric fullness, is the predominant symptom. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Irritable bowel syndrome</strong> &ndash;&nbsp;Up to 40 percent of patients with functional dyspepsia may have overlapping irritable bowel syndrome symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/1,6,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,46</a>]. Rather than epigastric pain associated with functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with a change in stool form or frequency. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1585108645\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of patients with functional dyspepsia is controversial and alleviates symptoms in only a small proportion of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F115195\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115195 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H293108854\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with functional dyspepsia should be tested and treated for <em>Helicobacter </em>pylori. We treat patients with functional dyspepsia who test negative for <em>H. pylori</em> and those with persistent symptoms four weeks after eradication of <em>H. pylori</em> with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65374\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65374 \">table 3</a>).

Serologic testing should not be performed due to the low positive predictive value.

It also has the benefit of preventing unrecognized peptic ulcers associated with <em>H. pylori</em>. A systematic review of 22 randomized controlled trials included 4896 patients with functional dyspepsia and <em>H. pylori</em> who were treated with eradication therapy or placebo. Eradication of <em>H. pylori </em>was associated with a small but significant benefit in relieving functional dyspepsia, with treatment of 13 patients needed to cure one case of functional dyspepsia (RR persistent dyspepsia 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.94) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].

A meta-analysis of 15 randomized trials that included 5853 patients with functional dyspepsia PPIs were significantly more effective as compared with placebo in reducing symptoms of dyspepsia (RR dyspepsia remaining 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.94) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In general, twice daily PPIs are no better than once daily PPIs for the treatment of functional dyspepsia and dosing should not be increased to twice daily in patients who do not respond after eight weeks of once daily PPI therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. In patients with functional dyspepsia who respond to PPI therapy, attempts should be made to discontinue PPIs every 6 to 12 months to minimize long-term risk of therapy. </p><p>Patients with functional dyspepsia are more likely to respond to H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) as compared with placebo. However, the effect of H2RAs in relieving symptoms of functional dyspepsia is likely to be small. There are also insufficient data comparing PPI therapy with H2RAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/6,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,57</a>]. In a 2006 meta-analysis that included 12 trials with a total of 2183 patients, H2RAs were associated with a 23 percent reduction in symptoms compared to placebo (RRR 23 percent, 95% CI 8-35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The NNT with H2RAs to improve one case of dyspepsia was seven subjects. However, the quality of most trials included was poor and there was significant heterogeneity among studies. Another limitation of these studies is that patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease may have been misclassified as having functional dyspepsia.</p><p>Antacids are often used, occasionally in combination with viscous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, to treat dyspepsia, although evidence of their efficacy is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

For patients with a partial clinical response to a PPI, a tricyclic antidepressant can be initiated as combination therapy. For patients who fail to improve on a PPI, the PPI should be stopped and a tricyclic antidepressant initiated. Given the side effects associated with prokinetics and the limited evidence of efficacy, we reserve the use of prokinetics for patients who fail tricyclic antidepressant (TCAs). We suggest psychotherapy in motivated patients who associate symptoms with stressors and in patients who fail medical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H818000501\"><span class=\"h3\">Antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central mechanisms may contribute to functional dyspepsia either through increased upper gastrointestinal sensitivity or through other mechanisms. We suggest TCAs in patients with functional dyspepsia and persistent symptoms despite PPI therapy for eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>We begin with a TCA at a low dose (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> 10 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a> 25 mg at night). The dose may be increased at two-week intervals. A dose of 20 to 30 mg is adequate in many patients, and we do not exceed a dose of 75 mg in most patients. Higher doses may not be more effective than lower doses and may be associated with daytime sedation and other anticholinergic side effects. We usually continue the TCA for 8 to 12 weeks before stopping, if it is ineffective. If the patient responds in a few weeks, we usually continue the drug for about six months and then try stopping the drug. The TCA can be resumed if dyspepsia recurs. While some clinicians prefer to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trazodone</a> rather than amitriptyline or desipramine, there is little clinical data to support its use. &#160;</p><p>The use of TCAs is limited by their side effects which include constipation, dry mouth, urinary retention, and somnolence. In a randomized controlled trial, 107 patients with functional dyspepsia refractory to PPI therapy and prokinetics were assigned to low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a> (50 mg daily) or placebo for 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Patients treated with imipramine were significantly less likely to have had a treatment failure at 12 weeks as compared with placebo (22 versus 46 percent).

Patients randomized to amitriptyline but not escitalopram were more likely to report adequate relief of symptoms as compared with placebo (53, 38, 40 percent, respectively). Based on Rome II symptom criteria, subjects with ulcer-like functional dyspepsia were more than three times as likely to report adequate relief when treated with amitriptyline compared with those who received placebo (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.1&ndash;9.0), but drug and placebo responses in patients with dysmotility-like dyspepsia were similar. In patients with delayed gastric emptying, neither drug differed from placebo in providing adequate relief.

In a systematic review of 12 randomized trials that included 1563 patients with functional dyspepsia, all trials reported a benefit of psychological therapy as compared with medical management. In four trials that included 789 patients with functional dyspepsia, psychological therapies reduced the incidence of dyspepsia by 47 percent (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.44&ndash;0.65).

However, it is important to recognize there are no successful trials of antinociceptives in patients with functional dyspepsia and evidence to support their use in patients with functional dyspepsia is indirect. As an example, a post hoc analysis of data obtained from six randomized controlled trials in patients with generalized anxiety disorder and prominent gastrointestinal symptoms showed that pregabalin was significantly more effective than placebo in treating both anxiety and gastrointestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-dyspepsia-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complementary</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>alternative</strong> <strong>medicine</strong> &ndash; Several complementary and alternative medicine approaches to functional dyspepsia have been described.
