Use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, also known as ecstasy) may also induce valve disease.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carcinoid-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carcinoid heart disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The link between these two conditions appears to be serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is elevated in serum and plasma of most patients with carcinoid heart valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As noted above, fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine augment serotonergic activity, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a> may contribute to the fenfluramine valvulopathy by interfering with the pulmonary clearance of serotonin.</p><p>Serotonin is also thought to play a role in the valve disease associated with ergot derivatives <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ergotamine</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], methysergide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and the dopamine agonists pergolide and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. These drugs are structurally similar to serotonin and are thought to produce valve disease by stimulation of serotonin (5-HT 2B) receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Parkinson disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Although serotonin appears to play a central role in drug-induced valve disease, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>), which are commonly used for the treatment of depression and other disorders, do not appear to be associated with valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>). This may be because activation of serotonin-2B receptors, which are located on both mitral and aortic valves, is required to induce valve disease. Support for this hypothesis comes from a study that found that drugs associated with valvular heart disease or metabolites of such drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ergotamine</a> and metabolites of fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, and methysergide, had high affinity for and were partial to full agonists of the serotonin-2B receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. By contrast, drugs not associated with valvular disease had low affinity for this receptor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a> and fluoxetine) or were a potent antagonist (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trazodone</a>).</p><p>Serotonin stimulates fibroblast growth and fibrogenesis, which appears to underlie the valve disease seen in patients with carcinoid and anorectic drug and ergot derivative related heart valve disease. More direct evidence for a central role of serotonin comes from studies in animals:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a rat model in which daily serotonin injections were given for three months, valvular abnormalities (aortic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary regurgitation) developed in six of ten rats, with histopathologic examination showed carcinoid-like plaques similar to those seen in humans with carcinoid heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There were no valvular changes in control rats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another mechanism of raising serotonin levels is to interfere with its metabolism. This process is mediated in part by the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) transporter, which is responsible for serotonin inactivation as it passes through the lungs. Both valvular hyperplasia and fibrosis were observed in a mouse model in which the 5-HT transporter gene was knocked out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3549545567\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Food and Drug Administration, and National Institutes of Health were issued in 1997 for patients who were exposed to fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for any length of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In the absence of abnormal findings, a repeat history and physical examination can be performed in six to eight months. The validity of this approach was illustrated in a study of 223 patients receiving dexfenfluramine for seven months; the absence of heart murmurs predicted the absence of echocardiographic valvular regurgitation in 93 percent of patients, while the presence of a murmur had a positive predictive value of only 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography to assess valve morphology and regurgitation is indicated in patients with a history of use of any drug associated with valvular heart disease who have a heart murmur, symptoms of valvular heart disease, or a technically inadequate auscultatory examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal timing of follow-up echocardiography to determine the progression, regression, or stabilization of valvular lesions is not known.

As a result, aggressive strategies have been developed for weight reduction in obese patients. One such strategy is the prescription of appetite suppressing or anorectic drugs, usually in combination with diet, exercise, and behavior modification. Some of these drugs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a characteristic form of valvular heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Patients who developed valve disease have generally been treated with an off-label fenfluramine in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a> (called &quot;fen-phen&quot;).

The ensuing increase in serotonergic activity has an anorectic effect.

Its activity is relatively selective to serotonergic pathways in the brain, but the appetite suppression is similar to that of fenfluramine. In 1996, the FDA approved dexfenfluramine as a single-drug appetite suppressant for longer term use in markedly obese subjects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phentermine</a> &ndash; Phentermine (Adipex, Fastin, Ionamin) is a noradrenergic central nervous system stimulant that was approved by the FDA as an appetite suppressant in 1959.

Most of the reported cases of valvular disease in patients taking anorectic drugs were in patients using this combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Approximately 18 million prescriptions were written for either fenfluramine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a> in 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In 1997 the FDA asked the manufacturers to withdraw fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine (but not phentermine) from the market. Assuming that the average prescription was written for one month and that the treatment course lasted three to twelve months, it is likely that several million Americans were exposed to these drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Relation to valvular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1997, cardiac ultrasonographers at the MeritCare Medical Center in Fargo, North Dakota and clinicians at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota described valvular heart disease in 24 women (average age 44) who had been treated with the combination of fenfluramine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. All 24 had cardiac symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a heart murmur. Aortic or mitral regurgitation (or both) was present in all 24; one-half also had tricuspid involvement. The average dose of fenfluramine was 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and the dose of phentermine was 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. The mean duration of treatment with fenfluramine-phentermine was 11 months (range 1 to 28 months). Five patients required valve replacement, while less severe valvular regurgitation was present in the remaining patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An additional 28 cases were reported simultaneously by physicians from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These patients, all women, exhibited a similar history of valvular heart disease in association with the use of a combination of fenfluramine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a>. As a result of these observations, the manufacturer withdrew fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine from the market (September 1997).</p><p>Subsequently, more than 100 additional provider-initiated case reports were received by the FDA. Valvulopathy was associated with the use of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine, alone or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a>. There were no cases with the use of phentermine alone.</p><p>Unfortunately, these initial descriptions of an association between valvulopathy and anorectic drugs do not represent epidemiologic or even case-control studies. Subsequent randomized and case-controlled studies provided additional information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>], but several issues remain unclear:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of regurgitant valvular lesions in obese patients not exposed to these drugs is not well-established.

Mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation were present in 1.3 percent of controls, 12.8 percent of patients receiving dexfenfluramine (odds ratio 12.7), 22.8 percent of those taking the combination of dexfenfluramine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a> (odds ratio 24.5), and 25.2 percent of patients taking both fenfluramine and phentermine (odds ratio 26.3) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76203\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76203 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>A much lower prevalence of valvulopathy has been reported by others. One nonrandomized study examined 223 patients exposed to dexfenfluramine for a mean of 6.9 months and 189 unexposed controls; at least mild aortic regurgitation or moderate mitral regurgitation was significantly more frequent in patients treated with dexfenfluramine (7.6 versus 2.1 percent for controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The difference was primarily due to more frequent mild aortic regurgitation (6.3 versus 1.6 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57538\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57538 \">figure 2</a>). Factors independently associated with any grade of aortic regurgitation were older age, diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67953\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67953 \">figure 3</a>), and a shorter time from drug discontinuation to echocardiogram, which suggests that dexfenfluramine-related valve regurgitation may regress after drug discontinuation.</p><p>Another nonrandomized, but reader-blinded, controlled echocardiographic study of 934 patients treated for at least 30 days with dexfenfluramine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/fenfluramine</span> and 539 untreated matched controls found an increase in the prevalence of aortic regurgitation with these drugs (8.9 and 13.7 versus 4.1 percent for placebo) but no difference in the prevalence of mitral regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There was no difference in the rate of serious cardiac events (myocardial infarction, heart failure, or ventricular arrhythmia) in treated and untreated subjects.</p><p>In a prospective randomized trial of dexfenfluramine or sustained-release dexfenfluramine versus placebo administered for an average of 71 days, echocardiograms were obtained in 1072 patients within one month of treatment discontinuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There was a nonsignificant trend towards more valvular regurgitation with dexfenfluramine compared with placebo (6.5 and 7.3 versus 4.5 percent, respectively). The low incidence of valvulopathy in this report may have been due to the brief duration of therapy; the course of the valvular disease in these patients is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> below.)</p><p>Support for a relationship between the duration of therapy and the incidence of valvular abnormalities comes from the Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program which conducted a population-based and a nested case-control analysis of 6532 subjects treated with dexfenfluramine, 2371 who received fenfluramine, 862 treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a>, and 9281 obese subjects who did not take these drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The risk of valvular disease appears to increase relative to the cumulative dose of pergolide or cabergoline. As with anorectic drugs, the mechanism is probably related to pergolide and cabergoline activation of serotonin (5-HT 2B type) receptors expressed on heart valves, which in turn leads to valvular overgrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].
