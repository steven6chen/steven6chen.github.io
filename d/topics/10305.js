Poor oral intake prior to presentation may result in dehydration, so many patients require fluid resuscitation.

High rates of malnourishment among patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis were demonstrated in a Veterans Administration Cooperative Study that included 284 patients with alcoholic hepatitis who underwent a complete nutritional assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-alcoholic-hepatitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Correction of the coagulopathy with fresh frozen plasma is <strong>not</strong> recommended unless there is active hemorrhage or the need to perform an invasive procedure. In theory, volume expansion from fresh frozen plasma administration may increase the risk of variceal hemorrhage in a patient with portal hypertension.

The majority of studies have demonstrated improvement in liver function and histology with nutritional therapy, though they have not consistently found reductions in mortality. In addition, a pilot, open-label study suggested that combining nutritional therapy with glucocorticoids might allow for a reduced course of glucocorticoids, but further studies are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-alcoholic-hepatitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>Given the evidence suggesting a possible benefit with nutritional therapy, we suggest nutritional support for patients with alcoholic hepatitis. In general, enteral feeding is preferred over intravenous nutrition. Although protein ingestion is a theoretical risk factor for the development of hepatic encephalopathy, protein feeding is well tolerated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, and protein should <strong>not</strong> be routinely restricted in such patients. In patients who develop encephalopathy associated with protein feeding, use of branched-chain amino acids may be helpful. In our experience, patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis eat almost no calories unless spoon-fed by relatives or friends. If calorie counts show that the patient is not taking in enough nutrition, a duodenal feeding tube can dramatically improve calorie intake. If the patient pulls the tube out unintentionally, a bridle can be used to retain the tube in place.

In addition, if present, ascitic fluid should be obtained for culture, cell count with differential, total protein, and albumin level.

Mortality rates after one to six months among patients treated with glucocorticoids in these trials ranged from 15 to 63 percent.

However, the use of pentoxifylline in the management of alcoholic hepatitis remains controversial because the data supporting its use are inconsistent. Several studies and meta-analyses failed to show a benefit with regard to mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-alcoholic-hepatitis/abstract/48,67-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,67-71</a>], while other studies and meta-analyses have suggested that pentoxifylline may prevent hepatorenal syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decrease mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-alcoholic-hepatitis/abstract/22,47,68,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,47,68,72</a>]. The largest meta-analysis supports the observation that pentoxifylline decreases the risk of acute kidney injury and suggests that pentoxifylline improves mortality compared with placebo, but is not superior to glucocorticoids (however, confidence in the estimates of the effect of pentoxifylline compared with glucocorticoids was low because the analysis included low-quality studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-alcoholic-hepatitis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>The network meta-analysis included 22 trials with 2621 patients and compared several different treatment approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-alcoholic-hepatitis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

The trial included 1103 patients with a DF &ge;32 who were randomly assigned to receive placebo, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, pentoxifylline, or both prednisolone and pentoxifylline. Mortality at 28 days was 17 percent in the placebo arm, 14 percent in the prednisolone arm, 19 percent in the pentoxifylline arm, and 13 percent in the prednisolone and pentoxifylline arm. The odds ratio for mortality for patients receiving prednisolone (with or without pentoxifylline) was 0.72 (95% CI 0.52-1.01), and for pentoxifylline (with or without prednisolone) was 1.07 (95% CI 0.77-1.49). However, it is important to note that the mortality rate seen in patients who did not receive prednisolone or pentoxifylline (17 percent) was significantly lower than seen in the placebo arms from other trials (approximately 25 to 45 percent at one month) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-alcoholic-hepatitis/abstract/12,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20-22</a>]. This lower-than-expected mortality rate in patients who received placebo raises the possibility that the patients included in the trial were not representative of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis in general, though it could also reflect generally improved care of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. Ways in which the patients may not have been representative include failure to exclude patients with diagnoses other than alcoholic hepatitis (the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis was made clinically, and the authors do not indicate how other causes of liver disease were excluded) and the exclusion of patients with renal failure, active gastrointestinal bleeding, untreated sepsis, or the need for inotropic support if their condition did not stabilize within the first seven days. Importantly, the exclusion of patients with renal failure may have biased the results against pentoxifylline because much of the benefit with pentoxifylline appears to be related to preventing or reversing hepatorenal syndrome. </p><p>To truly evaluate the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a>, trials are needed that have rigorous entry criteria (to ensure all patients have alcoholic hepatitis) and that do not exclude higher-risk patients (particularly those with renal failure).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164407366\"><span class=\"h3\">Possibly effective treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other medical therapies have been investigated for the treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis, though whether they will have a role in the routine treatment of alcoholic hepatitis is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-alcoholic-hepatitis/abstract/8,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,73</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Enteral nutrition</strong> &ndash; In addition to its role in the general management of patients with alcoholic hepatitis, nutritional therapy may have a role as an alternative to glucocorticoids in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, though additional trials are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-alcoholic-hepatitis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

In addition, histologic features of alcoholic hepatitis persisted for up to 14 months after discontinuing alcohol, suggesting that resolution of inflammation is slow. Thus, even patients who abstain from alcohol require ongoing evaluation for the development of cirrhosis.

Prednisolone does not appear to be beneficial in such patients. In addition, we suggest <strong>against</strong> pharmacologic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Pentoxifylline has not been studied in this population, and its efficacy in patients with more severe alcoholic hepatitis has not been established. The mainstay of treatment for patients with mild to moderate alcoholic hepatitis is abstinence from alcohol and supportive care.

We prefer prednisolone (40 mg per day for 28 days) to pentoxifylline because of the larger body of research supporting its use. After the 28-day course of therapy is complete, we taper the prednisolone over 16 days. However, steroids must be used cautiously, particularly in patients who are unlikely to return for follow-up after discharge from the hospital. In the absence of a clinician guiding their treatment, such patients are at risk for continuing steroids long-term (with all of the associated side effects). (See <a href=\"#H234081688\" class=\"local\">'Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis'</a> above.)<br/><br/>If there are contraindications to the use of glucocorticoids, pentoxifylline is an alternative. Pentoxifylline is given as 400 mg three times per day for 28 days (once daily for 28 days in patients with a creatinine clearance &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute)</span>. Pentoxifylline has less evidence to support its use, but it may be particularly attractive for patients who are at risk for sepsis and for those at risk for failing to follow-up after discharge.

Since the Lille score incorporates a bilirubin decrease in response to steroids, it may also be used to determine if steroids should be continued.
