These include difficulties with communication and transportation, implementation of care plans, follow-up of abnormal tests, and guardianship for newborns after delivery.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues encountered in caring for incarcerated pregnant women. While much of the discussion is based on data and experience from the United States, the general care principles may be applicable to other locations. Topics on general medical care in correctional facilities, general prenatal care, and the impact of incarceration on children are presented separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-care-of-incarcerated-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical care of incarcerated adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-initial-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Initial assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Second and third trimesters&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1097593950\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The female inmate population has grown at a rate double that of men in many countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The number of incarcerated women in the United States has increased by more than 700 percent in three decades, from 26,378 women in 1980 to 215,332 women in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Approximately 1.2 million women in the United States were under the supervision of the criminal justice system at year-end 2014 (including active incarceration, parole, or probation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Data on pregnancy and incarceration are limited because of variable reporting requirements and inconsistent pregnancy testing on entry to correctional facilities. In the United States, approximately 6 to 10 percent of incarcerated women are pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], which translates to approximately 12,000 pregnant incarcerated women at any given time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4007300505\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1120342341\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Policies on screening for pregnancy as women enter the correctional system vary by institution. The National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advise offering pregnancy testing to all women under the age of 55 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In addition, the NCCHC advises repeat testing two weeks later and as needed for those female inmates who remain at risk of pregnancy (eg, conjugal visits from spouses, leaves of absence during incarceration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Pregnancy screening upon entry to the correctional system allows for timely counseling regarding possible emergency contraception, prenatal care, triage of pregnant women with obstetric or medical concerns (eg, vaginal bleeding, possible ectopic pregnancy, opiate withdrawal), and pregnancy termination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency contraception&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1113866018\"><span class=\"h2\">Staff and patient communication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To ensure that the patient receives the care she needs, communication needs to occur among the on- and off-site medical staff, patient, and security staff. On-site medical staff tend to establish treatment schedules and ensure feasibility of treatment plans (for both on- and off-site visits). The inmate is then given permission per facility protocol (a written document or entry in a computerized inmate management system) that allows her to leave her unit or other duties in the correctional facility to visit the medical unit at specified times for on-site care. Officers and on-site clinicians who do not regularly provide prenatal care for incarcerated women may need to be advised on activity restrictions (eg, types of work assignments), safety (eg, use of the bottom bunk bed, violence among inmates, restrictions on shackling such as no leg restraints), nutritional requirements and interventions (eg, vitamin supplementation, continuous access to hydration, small frequent meals, special diets such as a diabetic diet), and the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). In addition, most facilities request that future appointments are communicated with the on-site health care providers so future transport can be arranged. Inmates are typically not told of their future off-site appointment dates for security reasons.</p><p>While the resources of correctional systems vary, we have found the following approach enables expedient care for the pregnant woman and successful communication among health care providers and correctional staff:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upon entry into a correctional facility, a women's health provider enters routine pregnancy restrictions into the inmate management system that can be viewed by correctional officers and other on-site medical staff. The restrictions are active for the duration of pregnancy and for six weeks after the estimated date of delivery. This process occurs within 24 to 72 hours of arrival. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If on-site prenatal providers are not present when a new patient arrives, orders for routine prenatal care and medications (eg, prenatal vitamins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, anti-emetics) are reviewed by the admissions nurse with the on-call medical provider so patients can receive necessary treatments in a timely fashion. Appropriate pregnant patients may have certain medication orders approved for &quot;keep on person&quot; status, which allows the woman to take a supply of medication with her rather than returning to the medication line every time those drugs are needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electronic health records allow correctional staff and medical providers to communicate. The correctional staff can view the dates, times, and locations of all inmate appointments (eg, court dates, medical appointments, mental health appointments or group sessions, childbirth classes [where available], or work assignments). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For appointments at off-site facilities, the off-site providers place their notes and any follow-up appointment information in a sealed medical documents folder that the correctional officer carries back to the facility. The medical documents folder is then given to the nursing staff or a medical provider who ensures information about future appointments is entered into the inmate management system. If questions arise regarding the ability of the correctional facility to meet the requirements of the treatment plan, the correctional staff contacts the on-site women's health nurse practitioner.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At times, incarcerated patients will ask the off-site obstetrics provider to authorize or request special privileges such as extra blankets, pillows, or food. We have found that if the off-site providers communicate these requests with on-site medical staff, the latter will review such requests with the correctional staff to make sure those special privileges are considered in the correctional setting to be medically necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3377567361\"><span class=\"h2\">HIPAA compliance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), an inmate's medical information is deemed protected health information (PHI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. An off-site clinician can share medical information with the correctional facility if the PHI is necessary for the provision of health care or to protect the health and safety of the individual or other inmates. Correctional officers should <strong>never</strong><em> </em>be used to communicate between off-site and on-site providers, as they are not health care providers nor are they held to HIPAA standards. During a prenatal visit, the clinician may have to request that the correctional officer leave the room for examinations, procedures, or delivery to ensure the patient's privacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A correctional officer's presence may be necessary in some situations, such as security or escape issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3401466037\"><span class=\"h2\">Consent for medical procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The process of obtaining patient consent for medical treatment or procedures is the same in correctional settings as in community settings. Inmates have autonomy: the right to make informed health care decisions, including refusal of medical care if they are deemed to have the capacity to make this decision. Specific to the correctional setting, inmates may be banned from consenting to sterilization because of historic concerns around coercive sterilization. (See <a href=\"#H4163404273\" class=\"local\">'Contraception'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4070890189\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy termination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While incarcerated, women retain a legal right to abortion services, individual experience varies by the state, region, and facility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Full access to services, including appointments, transportation, and payment, is not always available. </p><p>Most correctional facilities do not pay for abortion-related services. Therefore, incarcerated women, who have limited opportunities to save or borrow money while in custody, must rely on private savings or must seek a donor through nonprofit sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Pregnancy termination procedures are considered an outpatient service, and in certain locations the costs are covered either by the health care vendor contracted by the Department of Corrections (DOC) or the DOC itself if there is no vendor. Hospital admissions of greater than 24 hours can be billed to Medicaid. The Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal dollars to fund abortions, which affects women in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. </p><p>In our practice setting, abortion care is provided through our safety net hospital, and every attempt is made to provide same-day services (eg, counseling and, if desired, an abortion procedure at the same visit) to minimize patient discomfort and potential transportation challenges.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3817510653\"><span class=\"h2\">Transportation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal care of incarcerated women is generally shared between on-site and community-based clinicians. Thus, transport to nearby medical facilities is typically needed for portions of routine care (eg, surveillance ultrasounds) or to manage high-risk or complicated pregnancies. Transportation to and from an outside medical facility can be stressful, and some women decline outside medical care for this reason. Potential stressors include long wait times to pass through security systems, embarrassment about being seen in public in inmate uniforms and restraints, and the need to be strip searched on return to the correctional facility. Transportation to appointments can be further complicated by unanticipated lockdowns that halt inmate movement through and out of the facility.</p><p>When caring for incarcerated women with high-risk problems, the amount of time required for the entire transport process needs to be factored into management plans. With the onset of a medical problem or emergency, the patient generally needs to contact a correctional officer, who will then contact a nurse, who will contact a clinician or other health care professional with obstetrical experience before the decision is made to evaluate or transfer the patient. Additional time is required for passage through the security systems. These events occur before the patient is on her way to the outside medical facility, which could be a significant distance from the correctional facility where she is housed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1279995982\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuity of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While an estimated 1400 women per year deliver while incarcerated in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], most pregnant women will be released prior to delivery. Upon leaving a correctional facility, obstacles to continuity of care include lack of stable housing, transportation, and financial challenges (eg, lack of income, savings, or support from friends or family to pay for food and shelter).</p><p>To help ensure that time-sensitive tests (eg, ultrasound, laboratory tests) or frequent treatments (eg, progesterone injections) occur on schedule, we take the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide intensive assistance to help reactivate a patient's health insurance prior to release.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When possible, share all follow-up appointment dates with the inmate immediately prior to release and explain the purpose, and importance, of each. This transfer of information may not be possible if an inmate is released directly from court.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where possible, schedule follow-up care with the same provider or health care facility that managed the woman's care during incarceration. For women who cannot follow up with the prior care provider, we make every attempt to transfer their care and records prior to their release to the inmate's preferred prenatal provider.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encourage correctional facilities to provide patients with medication in hand to bridge pregnant women to their next appointment. If medication cannot be released, the on-site medical staff can fax or call in prescriptions to outside pharmacies to be filled. In our experience, prescriptions are best written by the on-site medical staff as they have the most accurate information as to when the patient may be released from the facility (the individual often does not have this information). Institutional policies vary regarding provision of medication upon release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a>, we contact an accessible treatment clinic or approved provider prior to the patient's release from the correctional facility. Methadone clinics typically require very specific documentation from the medical providers in the correctional facility, including a letter documenting the patient's last methadone dose.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1227576485\"><span class=\"h1\">PROVISION OF ROUTINE PRENATAL CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incarcerated individuals are entitled to health care under the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Policies regarding pregnancy-related health care for female inmates vary among states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/1,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17-19</a>].

The father of the baby may not be available for genetic testing, which is sometimes important when the maternal result is abnormal. In addition, incarcerated women have reduced access to information on the <span class=\"nowrap\">test/disease</span> as correctional facilities typically have limited library resources and no internet access for inmates. For these reasons, clinicians are advised to discuss abnormal test results, provide counseling services, and offer diagnostic testing during the same visit, if possible, or as expediently as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasound examination</strong> &ndash; Ultrasound examination for confirming or revising the estimated date of delivery, screening for congenital anomalies, and fetal surveillance (growth, well-being) follows the same guidelines as for non-incarcerated women. Given the challenges of scheduling and transportation, efforts are made to provide immediate counseling and support for abnormal test results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-prenatal-ultrasonography-as-a-screening-tool\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine prenatal ultrasonography as a screening tool&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rh(D) status</strong> &ndash; All pregnant inmates undergo an early maternal blood type with antibody screen as a part of their routine prenatal care. Intravenous drug abuse, particularly the practice of needle sharing, is a risk factor for alloimmunization to Rh(D) and non-Rh(D) red blood cell alloantibodies in pregnancy. Rh(D)-negative women without alloantibodies receive anti-D immunoglobulin for routine indications (eg, bleeding during pregnancy) and as prophylaxis at 28 weeks of gestation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of Rhesus (D) alloimmunization in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist is desirable for pregnancies complicated by alloimmunization.

The presence of a support person, even during a cesarean delivery, is not usually allowed. In house childbirth education can help reduce anxiety about the birth process and prepare the woman for returning to a correctional facility without her child. Models of childbirth education include facilitated group discussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] and doula visits to the correctional facility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3564348731\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC MEDICAL CONCERNS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1219100904\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy-related complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incarcerated women tend to have complicated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high-risk pregnancies. Contributing factors include low socioeconomic status, late or no previous prenatal care, current or prior trauma (physical, sexual, and psychological), illicit drug <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alcohol abuse, smoking, mental health disorders, chronic illness, and acute or chronic infectious diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-29</a>]. As in any pregnancy, each patient is assessed for risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome and monitored and treated as appropriate for the clinical situation.</p><p>Medical complications of pregnancy that require special treatment plans are particularly challenging for incarcerated women because inmates have limited access to medical facilities and difficulties with transportation. As an example, inmates are typically required to go to a medical unit every time a glucose or blood pressure check is performed because medical equipment such as lancets can pose a security risk. The timing and frequency of access to the medical unit can be restricted by the need for a nurse or correctional officer to call and escort the woman to the medical unit. </p><p>To help overcome these obstacles and facilitate the communication of critical or complex care plans, we advise appointing a medical liaison to oversee medical conditions that are primarily managed by off-site practitioner(s). The medical liaison can communicate changes in the care plan with the facility clinicians, answer questions for the inmate or correctional staff, and help resolve system challenges or failures. In our practice, our liaison is a team composed of a women's health nurse practitioner who is based entirely in the correctional facility, as well as an obstetrician-gynecologist who primarily works at the off-site hospital where incarcerated patients will deliver and comes to the correctional facility on a weekly basis to provide care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2643914827\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious disease</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sexually transmitted infections</strong> &ndash; Tests for the following sexually transmitted infections are performed routinely at the first prenatal visit and then repeated in the third trimester for women who are at high risk: syphilis, hepatitis B antigen, hepatitis C antibody, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), chlamydia, and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>. Incarcerated women also benefit from routine <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em> testing. In a cross-sectional analysis of data from 205 women entering a correctional facility in Rhode Island who were at risk for an unplanned pregnancy, one-third tested positive for gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomonas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As these women are also at increased risk of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, cervical cytology and HPV testing is performed if not up-to-date.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were over 20,000 inmates with HIV or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in state and federal prisons in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. While 91 percent of these individuals were men, high-risk practices such as drug use with needle sharing, unprotected sex, and engaging in sex work are more common among incarcerated women and increase their risk for HIV infection.

Those with a known diagnosis or who screen positive should be evaluated by a mental health specialist. Referral for mental health evaluation can be initiated by both medical and correctional staff. The request for evaluation is then triaged based on urgency. In our facility, inmates who do not require urgent care are seen within two weeks of the request. Medical treatment of mental health disorders must balance the risks and benefits of medication compared with no treatment for both the mother and the fetus (or infant, for breastfeeding women).

Abdominal trauma incurred during a fall can potentially cause placental abruption, which can lead to preterm labor. To promote patient health and safety in regions where restraints are used, clinicians should discuss the risks to the woman and fetus with corrections facility administration and advocate for total adherence to existing anti-shackling laws and recommendations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H313226333\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a systematic review reported that incarcerated women are at higher risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight than the general obstetrical population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], when compared with similarly disadvantaged obstetrical populations, maternal and fetal outcomes actually improve with increasing lengths of incarceration (eg, less preterm birth and growth restriction, higher birth weight). The improved outcomes may reflect the impact of regular prenatal care, stable housing and meals, relative physical security, and a reduction in drug and alcohol use.</p><p>On average, for each day spent incarcerated while pregnant, an infant's birth weight increases by 1.49 g compared with infants born to women incarcerated at times other than during their pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In addition, compared with disadvantaged women living in the community, incarcerated women had a lower risk of stillbirth (odds ratio [OR] 0.35, 95% CI 0.14-0.84) and low birth weight (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Mothers who are eligible for contact with their infant may elect to breastfeed while in the hospital. This may require collaboration among correctional officers, obstetrics staff, newborn <span class=\"nowrap\">nursery/neonatal</span> intensive care unit staff, and social workers to support her efforts. Upon discharge, medical providers in the correctional facility should be prepared to help the woman anticipate engorgement and identify signs of mastitis.</p><p>Prolonged breastfeeding is rarely an option given the lack of widespread on-site nurseries that would allow for newborns to remain with their mothers while still in custody. If there will only be temporary separation between the mother and her infant due to imminent release, a correctional facility may be able to make special arrangements for an inmate to pump and discard the milk in order to preserve her milk supply. However, most facilities do not have the infrastructure to support prolonged pumping due to: (1) lack of privacy for inmates to pump, given shared cells and the need for correctional officers to maintain visual contact with inmates, (2) concern for potential self-harm or creation of weapons with parts of electric breast pumps (but hand pumps are an alternative), and (3) lack of storage protocols for breast milk, considered a potential hazardous bodily fluid. Some facilities have successful programs that allow incarcerated mothers to pump breast milk and have it stored until it can be picked up by the infant's guardian [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-for-incarcerated-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4163404273\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraceptive options are discussed as part of routine prenatal care.

An off-site clinician can share medical information with the correctional facility if the PHI is necessary for the provision of health care or to protect the health and safety of the individual or other inmates. Correctional officers should <strong>never</strong> be used to communicate between off-site and on-site providers as they are not health care providers nor are they held to HIPAA standards. (See <a href=\"#H3377567361\" class=\"local\">'HIPAA compliance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transport to nearby medical facilities is typically needed for portions of routine care (eg, surveillance ultrasounds) or to manage high-risk or complicated pregnancies. Transportation to and from an outside medical facility can be stressful, which can cause some women to decline outside medical care. When caring for incarcerated women with high-risk problems, the amount of time required for the entire transport process needs to be factored into management plans.

On leaving a correctional setting, obstacles to continuous care include lack of stable housing and financial challenges. Steps that help ensure continuity of care after release include re-establishing medical insurance, scheduling follow-up appointments, transferring health care records to the outside providers, and providing bridge medication or prescriptions to cover the woman's needs until her next scheduled appointment.

Most newborns will be separated from their mothers upon discharge from the hospital, and prolonged breastfeeding through pumping and storage is rarely an option. (See <a href=\"#H2174676185\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2319908807\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Jennifer G Clarke, MD, MPH, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
