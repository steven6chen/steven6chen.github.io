Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis is useful because it circumvents the need for temporary hemodialysis. Since more than 50 percent of all new dialysis patients do not have a dialysis plan when diagnosed with ESRD, urgent-start peritoneal dialysis may increase the number of patients who utilize peritoneal dialysis for renal replacement therapy since it provides peritoneal dialysis as a modality option from the start.</p><p>The practice of urgent-start dialysis requires developments of protocols, policies, and procedures to help implement the approach in a timely, efficient, and safe method.</p><p>This review discusses an approach to urgent-start peritoneal dialysis. Different types of peritoneal dialysis and peritoneal dialysis dosing are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a modality for chronic peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1514579085\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis is defined as initiation of peritoneal dialysis in patients with newly diagnosed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are not yet on dialysis and who require dialysis initiation less than two weeks after peritoneal dialysis catheter placement but do not require emergent dialysis. Indications for emergent dialysis include hyperkalemia, volume overload, or marked uremia (see <a href=\"#H540196356\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> below). Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis is generally reserved for patients who have no plan for dialysis modality but are considered good candidates for peritoneal dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287059698\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peritoneal dialysis is a type of dialysis that patients typically perform at home, after the patient (or family) receives appropriate training. Occasionally, peritoneal dialysis may be temporarily performed in a dialysis center to assist a patient who is unable to perform dialysis at home due to temporary disability or lack of adequate support at home or to provide dialysis to a patient who has not yet completed peritoneal dialysis training.</p><p>Peritoneal dialysis provides short- and long-term clinical outcomes that match or exceed in-center hemodialysis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis modality and patient outcome&quot;</a>). Peritoneal dialysis also provides patients with several lifestyle advantages that are not provided by hemodialysis and is less costly to the health care system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis modality and patient outcome&quot;, section on 'Selection of dialysis modality'</a>.)</p><p>Despite these advantages, in the United States, at least, peritoneal dialysis is rarely offered to patients who required urgent initiation of dialysis. Such patients are almost invariably started on hemodialysis using a temporary hemodialysis catheter. This is because most centers have established inpatient and outpatient protocols for performing acute or semi-acute hemodialysis but not for performing urgent peritoneal dialysis. As an example, most <span class=\"nowrap\">hospitals/medical</span> centers have a committed and expert surgical or interventional <span class=\"nowrap\">radiology/nephrology</span> staff that can place vascular catheters (which are often required for acute hemodialysis) within 24 hours. Most hospitals have access to a well-trained nursing staff that can provide hemodialysis quickly and safely.</p><p>By contrast, there are few medical centers that have committed staff available for the placement of peritoneal catheters semiurgently (ie, within 24 to 48 hours). In addition, few hospitals have committed nursing staff with expertise in peritoneal dialysis. Most outpatient peritoneal dialysis clinics do not have expertise in starting patients on peritoneal dialysis urgently.</p><p>In addition, it is the traditional practice to not use the peritoneal catheter for two to four weeks after placement in order to avoid pericatheter leaks or dysfunction. Although many reports have suggested that it is possible to use catheters before two weeks, experience doing so is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>].</p><p>As a result, peritoneal dialysis is traditionally offered only to patients who have been closely followed by a nephrologist and sufficiently informed about dialysis options prior to needing dialysis. In addition to being sufficiently informed to choose peritoneal dialysis, patients need to be trained to perform peritoneal dialysis, which takes approximately two weeks of instruction. As a result, it is challenging to initiate peritoneal dialysis in patients who present with advanced chronic kidney disease and require urgent dialysis.</p><p>The difficulty in initiating urgent peritoneal dialysis has contributed to the very low utilization of peritoneal dialysis in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It has also increased the utilization of temporary vascular catheters, which are associated with a high risk of infection and a higher mortality rate compared with fistulas or grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The vast majority (75 percent) of all predialysis patients in the United States start in-center hemodialysis with a central venous catheter as their initial dialysis access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Dialysis catheter complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tunneled, cuffed hemodialysis catheter-related bacteremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis potentially provides a number of benefits to selected patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It provides the choice of long-term peritoneal dialysis to patients who require initiation of renal replacement therapy within two weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It allows patients to avoid temporary hemodialysis catheters.</p><p/><p>In addition, urgent-start peritoneal dialysis may increase the overall utilization of peritoneal dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22321043\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with routine (ie, planned) peritoneal dialysis, there does not appear to be an increased risk of infectious complications, increased hospitalizations, or decreased short-term patient or technique survival associated with urgent-start peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/3-8,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8,11-13</a>]<em>.</em> In a prospective, observational study that compared one-year outcomes of urgent-start peritoneal dialysis versus traditional-start peritoneal dialysis in 27 patients, there were no differences in rates of peritonitis and exit-site infections between urgent-start (n = 18) and routine-start (n = 9) patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There were also no significant differences between groups in <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> anemia, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and albumin. In another single-center, matched, case-control study, there was no difference between urgent- and conventional-start peritoneal dialysis with respect to peritonitis or peritoneal dialysis-related infections or catheter migration or blockage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis may be associated with catheter complications, particularly including malpositioning and leaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Two single-center, university-based studies demonstrated an increased risk of leak in the urgent-start peritoneal dialysis population (approximately 10 to 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. However, most leaks were minor and managed conservatively without need for peritoneal dialysis catheter replacement. The catheter leaks did not lead to adverse patient outcomes or increased short-term patient dropout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. Additionally, the method of peritoneal dialysis catheter placement, whether percutaneous or laparoscopic, did not seem to correlate with episodes of catheter-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>].</p><p>Two studies evaluated the feasibility of urgent-start peritoneal dialysis in the private-practice environment. In a small study of 11 urgent-start peritoneal dialysis patients that utilized laparoscopic surgery for catheter placement, there were no significant short-term catheter or infectious-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In another prospective observation study of 81 patients, technique survival was 92.6 percent and dialysis-related hospitalizations 24 percent in the first 90 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis is associated with outcomes that are at least as good as urgent-start hemodialysis. This was shown in a prospective, observational study that compared urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (n = 66) with urgent-start hemodialysis (n = 57) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. At a minimum follow-up of six months, there was no difference in overall mortality between patients started on peritoneal dialysis versus hemodialysis (30 versus 42 percent, respectively). Compared with peritoneal dialysis, the incidence of bacteremia was higher in the hemodialysis group (3 versus 21 percent, respectively). In addition, compared with peritoneal dialysis, there was a nonsignificant increase in infection-related mortality in the hemodialysis group (9 versus 18, respectively, p = 0.19).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H540196356\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who require emergent dialysis (usually for hyperkalemia, volume overload, or marked uremia) are not good initial candidates for urgent-start peritoneal dialysis, since such patients can generally not wait 48 hours for peritoneal dialysis catheter placement. Furthermore, as compared with hemodialysis, it is more difficult to achieve rapid metabolic control with peritoneal dialysis. Such patients should be managed with hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy utilizing a temporary vascular catheter. Once stabilized, suitable peritoneal dialysis candidates may have a peritoneal dialysis catheter placed and rapidly transitioned to peritoneal dialysis with urgent-start peritoneal dialysis protocols.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22321049\"><span class=\"h1\">SETTING UP AN URGENT-START PERITONEAL DIALYSIS PROGRAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Establishing a successful urgent-start peritoneal dialysis program requires administrative support and the commitment of multiple disciplines. There are five key elements to a successful program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability to place peritoneal catheters with 48 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staff education regarding use of catheter immediately after placement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administrative support (inpatient and outpatient settings)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of appropriate urgent-start peritoneal dialysis candidates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Utilization of protocols in every step of the urgent-start process (from patient selection until ready to discharge home)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287059667\"><span class=\"h2\">Rapid catheter placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid peritoneal catheter placement is the rate-limiting step in any urgent-start program. If peritoneal dialysis catheters cannot be placed as quickly as tunneled hemodialysis catheters, the default pathway for late-referred patients will be hemodialysis.</p><p>Peritoneal catheters may be placed percutaneously (typically by interventional radiologists or nephrologists) or laparoscopically (typically by surgeons). Irrespective of the method of catheter placement, there must be a commitment by the surgical team to place catheters within 24 to 48 hours of request and to manage catheter complications in a timely manner. The method of placing the catheter may require modification to minimize the risk of pericatheter leaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Surgeons should be assured that the medical and nursing team will take specific steps to minimize the risk of early catheter complications despite early use of the catheter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287059674\"><span class=\"h2\">Staff education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inpatient and outpatient peritoneal dialysis nurses should be familiar with methods that minimize the risk of catheter complications (such as catheter leaks) in patients undergoing urgent-start peritoneal dialysis. These methods include the use of low-volume exchanges and having the patient in a recumbent position. Nurses should also be capable of managing early complications, such as catheter leaks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninfectious complications of peritoneal dialysis catheters&quot;, section on 'Pericatheter leakage'</a>.)</p><p>Ideally, there should be more than one nurse available who has sufficient expertise with early-start peritoneal dialysis. This is especially important in outpatient facilities, where the urgent-start patient may be dialyzed on-site, while other aspects of the peritoneal dialysis program are ongoing.</p><p>It is important that center-specific protocols for urgent-start peritoneal dialysis be designed with input from the peritoneal dialysis staff. If established urgent-start peritoneal dialysis programs exist in the geographic area, collaboration should be encouraged. To minimize concern about patient safety, outpatient peritoneal dialysis nurses should be assured that only medically stable patients will be dialyzed urgently in the outpatient dialysis clinics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287059680\"><span class=\"h2\">Administrative support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There must be adequate staffing, space, and equipment to establish an urgent-start peritoneal dialysis program. This requires the support of hospital and peritoneal dialysis clinic administration. Administrators must be aware of the potential benefits of urgent-start peritoneal dialysis. These include decreased vascular catheter-related complications, patient benefits, and the potential for decreased rehospitalization as compared with urgent-start hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"#H287059698\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22321043\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p>Hospital administrators must assure adequate surgical staffing, equipment (including catheter kits and peritoneal dialysis supplies), and adequate peritoneal dialysis nurse staffing and training. Outpatient administrators must assure adequate space, staffing, and supplies to allow for in-center peritoneal dialysis. In outpatient facilities, at least two rooms should be available for peritoneal dialysis. This is so that one room may be used for urgent-start patients while the other rooms are used for the usual activities of an outpatient peritoneal dialysis clinic (including routine visits of patients maintained on peritoneal dialysis and training of patients anticipating routine initiation of peritoneal dialysis). A chair that allows a recumbent position should be available to patients on urgent-start peritoneal dialysis in order to minimize increases in intra-abdominal pressure and risk of peritoneal fluid leak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287059686\"><span class=\"h2\">Identifying appropriate candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identifying the appropriate urgent-start peritoneal dialysis candidate increases the chances for successful initiation of dialysis and the probability of long-term technique survival. Appropriate candidates for urgent-start peritoneal dialysis include patients who have an urgent indication to start chronic dialysis. The candidate must not have absolute contraindications to chronic peritoneal dialysis (severe intraperitoneal adhesions, mental or physical incapacity without an assistant, uncorrectable mechanical defects such as hernias or internal leaks) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of peritoneal dialysis for the treatment of acute kidney injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and maintenance of the peritoneal dialysis catheter&quot;</a>) or have an emergent need for dialysis.</p><p>In addition, patients should not have an emergent indication for dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H540196356\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p>We utilize a bedside predialysis patient questionnaire to evaluate candidacy for chronic peritoneal dialysis. The two main areas evaluated are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social barriers (eg, home <span class=\"nowrap\">status/cleanliness,</span> access to toilet and sink, space for peritoneal dialysis supplies, employment status, family support)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Medical/surgical/psychiatric</span> barriers (eg, functional status, abdominal surgeries, psychiatric, memory issues, vision, hearing or dexterity impairment)</p><p/><p>Most of these barriers are not absolute contraindications to peritoneal dialysis and thus, as long as resolved, can allow patients to get onto peritoneal dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287059692\"><span class=\"h2\">Development of protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most successful urgent-start peritoneal dialysis programs are protocol driven. As noted above, protocols for urgent-start peritoneal dialysis should be designed with input from the peritoneal dialysis staff. Examples of urgent-start-specific protocols include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial assessment to evaluate need for immediate peritoneal dialysis initiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96385\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96385 \">table 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial urgent-start peritoneal dialysis prescription (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96290\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96290 \">table 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-peritoneal dialysis catheter patient orders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F97195\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97195 \">table 3</a>)</p><p/><p>The initial assessment includes clinical and lab parameters to determine the urgency of peritoneal dialysis initiation after placement of the peritoneal dialysis catheter. Patients are questioned about signs and symptoms suggesting severe uremia and volume overload (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for initiation of dialysis in chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>). Initial lab work is reviewed, in particular for hyperkalemia. If the evaluation suggests need for immediate dialysis initiation, automated low-volume, recumbent peritoneal dialysis is started (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96290\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96290 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Prior to catheter placement, orders should include presurgical bathing with antiseptic soap, preoperative antibiotics, and a bowel preparation to minimize bowel distension and risk for postoperative constipation. Postoperatively, strict orders are provided to avoid manipulating catheter dressing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F97195\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97195 \">table 3</a>). A bowel regimen should be prescribed postoperatively.</p><p>After placement, catheters are immediately tested for patency, functionality, and for the presence of blood with low-volume exchanges (ie, 500 mL). If the effluent is clear and the catheter functions normally, the abdomen is fully drained and left empty until the patient is seen in the dialysis unit for urgent-start peritoneal dialysis initiation. If the effluent is blood tinged, low-volume exchanges are continued until the blood clears the abdomen. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, heparin (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/liter)</span> is added to minimize the risk for clotting. If the bleeding fails to clear with three or four exchanges, the patient will need further evaluation to rule out internal bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F97195\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97195 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninfectious complications of peritoneal dialysis catheters&quot;, section on 'Bleeding'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H540194651\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL PRESCRIPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dialysis prescription must be modified from the usual chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) prescription in order to avoid pericatheter leak and other complications that may result from use of the catheter before the incision is completely healed from surgery and before the patient is trained to perform the dialysis alone.</p><p>The initial peritoneal dialysis prescription depends on the degree of residual renal function, patient size (body surface area), and clinical indicators as per the patient evaluation. Initial fill volumes are limited to 750 to 1250 mL, depending on the patient&rsquo;s body surface area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96290\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96290 \">table 2</a>). Time on therapy and number of cycles are determined by the patient&rsquo;s residual renal function and specific clinical parameters (including signs and symptoms of uremia, electrolyte and acid-base disorders, disorders of mineral metabolism). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for initiation of dialysis in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A typical prescription for a patient who has some residual renal function is four to six cycles over a five- to eight-hour period. Therapy is usually done on an alternate-day basis in the first two weeks after catheter placement. This allows for alternate dry days, which increase surgical healing. However, if needed, daily therapy can be provided. Strict measures are to be taken to avoid increase in intra-abdominal pressure to avoid leaks. These measures include a bowel regimen for all patients to avoid straining with bowel movement; cough suppressants, if needed; and draining patients when sitting up, eating, or ambulating (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96290\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96290 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22321055\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PATHWAY TO URGENT-START PERITONEAL DIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We employ the following clinical pathway for patients undergoing urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96270\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96270 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis options should be discussed with all patients who require urgent but not emergent dialysis.

It is useful because it circumvents the need for temporary hemodialysis. Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis may also increase the number of patients who utilize peritoneal dialysis for renal replacement therapy. (See <a href=\"#H22321031\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1514579085\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H287059698\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who require emergent dialysis (usually for hyperkalemia, volume overload, or marked uremia) are not good initial candidates for urgent-start peritoneal dialysis, since such patients cannot wait 48 hours for peritoneal dialysis catheter placement.

(See <a href=\"#H22321043\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate-limiting step in establishing a successful urgent-start peritoneal dialysis program is getting consistent, timely placement of peritoneal dialysis catheters (ie, within 48 hours). Other key elements to establishing a successful urgent-start program include sufficient numbers of trained peritoneal dialysis nurses, administrative support, and a suitable infrastructure and being able to quickly identify appropriate candidates. Establishing and utilizing protocols for every step of the urgent-start process will increase the chances for a successful program. (See <a href=\"#H22321049\" class=\"local\">'Setting up an urgent-start peritoneal dialysis program'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial peritoneal dialysis prescription depends on the degree of residual renal function, patient size (body surface area), and clinical indications for dialysis. Initial fill volumes are limited to 750 to 1250 mL. (See <a href=\"#H540194651\" class=\"local\">'Initial prescription'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strict measures should be taken to avoid increase in intra-abdominal pressure to avoid leaks. These measures include a bowel regimen for all patients to avoid straining with bowel movement; cough suppressants, if needed; and draining patients when sitting up, eating, or ambulating.
