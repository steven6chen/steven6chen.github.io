These envenomations are painful. The degree of pain is largely determined by the amount of venom injected and the animal encountered.</p><p>The puncture wounds associated with marine envenomations often have retained foreign bodies and are frequently contaminated. Most wounds are superficial although stingrays can cause deep penetrating injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21432424\"><span class=\"h2\">Coral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coral are cnidarians, like jellyfish, and members of the class Anthozoa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Coral stings and lacerations are common among snorkelers, surfers, and scuba divers who touch, step, or fall onto coral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Coral stings are usually only mildly toxic with local pain and erythema. The sting is caused by venomous capsules called nematocysts and can be treated similarly to jellyfish stings. In contrast, lacerations from coral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74728\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74728 \">picture 1</a>) are prone to secondary infection, including cellulitis, lymphangitis, fever, and ulceration of the wound within a few days of the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21432535\"><span class=\"h2\">Sea urchins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sea urchin is an echinoderm, and the most significant member of this phylum in United States waters. Other members of this phylum include starfish and sea cucumbers, which have no venom apparatus (poisonous rather than venomous). Echinoderms have long, sharp spines made of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> that easily penetrate flesh, rubber soled shoes, or wet suits, and may break off deep in the wound. Some species have venom-producing glands at the tips of the spines and thus, are venomous. Injuries typically occur after stepping or falling on an urchin, which results in multiple puncture wounds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54699\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54699 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Clinical findings include redness, swelling, bleeding from multiple puncture wounds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54699\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54699 \">picture 2</a>), and intense pain, which may last up to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Discoloration may occur around the wounds and may indicate retained sea urchin spines. If the change in color resolves within 48 hours, it is unlikely that a spine remains lodged in the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Imaging with plain radiographs or ultrasound may help identify the presence of embedded spines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21432613\"><span class=\"h2\">Venomous fish</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Venomous fish have specific apparatus designed to inject poison. Stings occur in the marine and fresh water environment and also from fish kept in private aquariums. The venom apparatus is similar for fish worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Spines cover integumentary sheaths which contain venom glands. When the spine penetrates the victim's skin, the surrounding integument covering the spine ruptures and venom is injected into the wound. The typical injury depends upon the fish and how it is encountered. For example, stonefish and weeverfish usually cause injuries when they are stepped on by swimmers or divers because they a bottom-dwellers, catfish cause injuries to the upper limbs when they are removed from fishing lines, and lionfish or scorpionfish typically envenomate the hands or fingers during routine care and feeding by their aquarium handlers.</p><p>The geographic distributions for the most common venomous fish include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Catfish</strong> &ndash; These bottom dwelling scavengers are found in fresh water rivers worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

They are frequently kept as pets in home aquariums.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weeverfish </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Weeverfish inhabit the shallow waters of the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F85906\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85906 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>Local pain of varying severity and a puncture wound comprise the main clinical effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. The pain may resolve over one hour in minor injuries, but with more severe stings (eg, marine catfish or stonefish (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82851\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82851 \">picture 3</a>)) the pain may persist for over 24 hours and may radiate. Local effects include a simple puncture wound with erythema and edema in more severe cases. Uncommonly the spine can break off in the wound such as with catfish spine injuries when they are being removed from fishing lines. The spines may also have a series of &quot;teeth&quot; or barbs making removal difficult. Extensive tissue injury and necrosis is usually a result of infection. </p><p>Systemic effects have been reported in more severe cases, including nausea, vomiting, headache, sweating, hypotension and even syncope. However, despite many reports of systemic effects they are most likely to be secondary to severe pain. Fatalities have been attributed to many types of venomous fish, including stonefish and catfish. However, these cases are poorly reported and in many cases are more likely due to septicemia from secondary infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21432621\"><span class=\"h2\">Stingrays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are over 150 species of stingrays worldwide, accounting for thousands of injuries every year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/1,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13-15</a>]. Stingrays possess whip-like tails with a furrowed, serrated spine containing secretory venom cells and sacs. When the animal is stimulated or frightened, it flings the barbed tail upward, embedding the spine in the victim which releases the venom. The resulting wound is a combination of a puncture and jagged laceration, usually of a limb (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67496\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67496 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>].</p><p>In temperate and semitropical zones, injuries often occur during late summer and early fall when stingrays burrow within the sand in shallow surf. Unsuspecting bathers may step on a stingray while entering the water. Stings may be prevented by shuffling the feet along the bottom when walking in the surf and wading at shallow ocean depths. Injuries to the upper limbs are less common when stingrays are removed from fishing lines and thoraco-abdominal trauma may occur rarely to divers.</p><p>Stingray injuries will cause immediate and intense pain at the site of entry. Pain may then radiate up the limb and usually persists for hours. The wound site may appear erythematous and dusky, but there is often significant bleeding which will depend upon the site of injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67496\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67496 \">picture 7</a>). Although numerous systemic effects are reported, they are uncommon and usually related to the systemic response to severe pain.</p><p>The size and length of the stingray spine will dictate the extent of injury and larger spines are at an increased risk of trauma and secondary infection. Death or severe injury may also occur if the spine penetrates a major blood vessel, the heart, or another vital organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thoracoabdominal injuries should be managed as per major penetrating trauma but have the additional risk of foreign body retention and infection. Those wounds that extend through the chest or abdominal wall will always need exploration in the operating room [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p>Lacerations of the popliteal artery and compartment syndrome have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9223610\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of marine envenomation is made based upon the following clinical findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of an encounter with a coral, sea urchin, venomous fish, or stingray during typical activities (eg, fishing, snorkeling, surfing, scuba diving, cleaning an aquarium) (see <a href=\"#H2386404\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and clinical manifestations'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden onset of pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single or multiple puncture wounds (depending upon the animal), especially when foreign bodies (eg, bits of coral, sea urchin spines, fish or stingray spines and integument) are present</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9223633\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Envenomation by jellyfish stings, sea snakes, cone snails or the blue-ringed octopus (<em>Hapalochlaena maculosa</em>) and skin lesions associated with marine animals are the primary diagnostic considerations when marine envenomation is suspected. Clinical features differ from marine envenomation by corals, sea urchins, fish, and stingrays as follows:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472406\"><span class=\"h2\">Jellyfish and sea anemone stings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with jellyfish or sea anemone stings do not have puncture wounds. After a jellyfish sting, linear red, urticarial lesions typically develop a few minutes later, although sometimes these lesions do not appear for several hours. &quot;Tentacle prints&quot; may be seen on examination of the skin, and less commonly vesiculation and ecchymosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54564\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54564 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71299\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71299 \">picture 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66901\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66901 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67949\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67949 \">picture 10</a>). Nematocysts can be obtained by skin scrapings or by applying sticky tape to the sting site when the diagnosis is unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jellyfish-stings#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jellyfish stings&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jellyfish-stings#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jellyfish stings&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Sea anemone stings present as circular and painful urticarial lesions which may have a central pallor. Treatment of these injuries and jellyfish stings are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jellyfish-stings#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jellyfish stings&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472414\"><span class=\"h2\">Blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena maculosa)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This animal is found in Papua New Guinea and Australia and its saliva contains tetrodotoxin which is a sodium channel blocker. The venomous bite typically occurs when it is picked up. The patient often thinks the bite is trivial at the time. However, symptoms begin within 10 to 20 minutes, and are marked by neurologic symptoms, such as paresthesias, muscular weakness, and respiratory arrest rather than pain. Treatment is supportive and includes close monitoring of respiratory status and timely endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation if respiratory failure occurs.

Typically they are found close to land in coral reefs or along islands although the pelagic sea snake may be found in open water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The bite of a sea snake is often painless with limited local tissue injury. However, after a quiescent period which may last up to several hours, systematic effects become apparent. The predominant systemic features are due to myotoxicity. Clinical features include muscle pain and tenderness, trismus and sometimes weakness, with systemic rhabdomyolysis in severe cases, acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. The urine will often appear dark due to myoglobinuria. Sea snakes do not cause coagulopathy; neurotoxicity has been reported after sea snake bites in Australia but is not a regular feature of envenomation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Sea snake envenomation may warrant treatment with antivenom (Sea Snake Antivenom, Seqirus, Parkville, Australia) depending on the severity. Consultation with a medical toxicologist is advised. A global directory of poison information centers is available at the WHO <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html&amp;token=vYXClxsD0hnrf4M8kYcoD1kMICrGjKQRRaFc8pA0pw9qlhpVmsmYh2e3Gi7webw9H9uSzH3nipQ0rPpTLYBWhGP+/wpQqUegRzvggwgKA6s=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6591\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>. The recognition and management of sea snake envenomation is discussed in detail elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8997414\"><span class=\"h2\">Cone snail</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cone snails are primarily found in the warm regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Envenomation occurs when the detachable radicular tooth is discharged via a harpoon-like apparatus and has primarily been described in divers and shell collectors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/6,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,24,25</a>]. The venom is a complex mix of proteins that have a wide range of effects on several different types of ion channels. Stings typically occur on the hand when the shell is held outside of water and are painful. Localized numbness spreads up the affected arm and can be accompanied by partial or complete total paralysis. Based upon one case report, paralysis may begin soon after the sting and may be prolonged. Total recovery has been described within three days of the sting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

These skin lesions are often accompanied by intense pruritus and occur in distinct patterns which differentiate them from marine envenomation. Commonly reported syndromes include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8997477\"><span class=\"h3\">Swimmer&rsquo;s itch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cercarial dermatitis, also known as swimmer's itch, is an itchy maculopapular rash that follows skin penetration by cercariae larvae of nonhuman schistosomes (often avian) which are found widely in natural bodies of fresh and salt water on all continents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82849\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82849 \">picture 11</a>). The distribution of the rash is limited to areas of the body immersed in water. Itchy red papules that may become vesicular develop hours to a day or so after exposure to water contaminated with schistosomes. As the bather's skin dries, the larvae burrow into the epithelium and then die.

The distribution of the lesions conforms to skin areas covered by a bathing suit, wet suit, or points of pressure (eg, wristbands of diving suits, flexural areas). Skin lesions are inflammatory papules, often becoming vesicular or pustular (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68535\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68535 \">picture 12</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H2386404\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marine envenomations are characterized by pain, which can be severe, and puncture wounds to the affected area. The degree of pain is largely determined by the amount of venom injected and the animal encountered. Severe pain is common after stonefish and stingray envenomations. Most wounds are superficial although stingrays can cause deep penetrating injuries. (See <a href=\"#H2386404\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of a marine envenomation is supported by a history of an encounter with a coral, sea urchin, venomous fish, or stingray during water activities, sudden onset of pain, and single or multiple puncture wounds (depending upon the animal) especially when foreign bodies (eg, bits of coral, sea urchin spines, fish or stingray spines and integument) are present. (See <a href=\"#H9223610\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of marine envenomation includes other toxic marine species and common marine skin lesions.
