Lymphedema is classified as primary or secondary depending on etiology and presentation. </p><p>The etiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, classification, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of lymphedema will be reviewed here. The prevention and treatment of lymphedema, the operative management of primary and secondary lymphedema, and an overview of the pathophysiology and etiology of generalized edema are presented separately.

Uptake of interstitial fluid begins in lymphatic capillaries and precollectors that abut the interstitial space. The process is facilitated by skeletal muscle contraction in the extremity. The initial lymphatics merge into vessels of increasing caliber that are partially surrounded by a specialized smooth muscle layer that, upon contraction, promotes peristaltic movement of the lymph fluid toward the systemic circulation. In addition, lymphatic collectors have unidirectional valves that prevent retrograde flow. </p><p>The lymph draining from both lower extremities, the gastrointestinal tract, and the left upper body (upper extremity, chest wall, upper back, shoulder, and breast) enter the venous circulation through the thoracic duct, which opens into the venous angle between the left subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57280\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57280 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The lymph draining from the right upper body drains into the right lymphatic duct via a similar right-sided venous angle.</p><p>In the extremities, the superficial lymphatic system drains the skin and subcutaneous tissue and drains into the deep system that then drains into the lymph nodes in the axilla or pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11024442\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphedema occurs when the lymphatic load exceeds the transport capacity of the lymphatic system, which causes filtered fluid to accumulate in the interstitium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This imbalance between interstitial fluid production and transport may be due to congenital malformation of the lymphatic system, or damage to lymphatic vessels or lymph nodes leading to a reduction in the numbers of lymph channels or obstruction of the available channels. Persistent accumulation of lymphatic fluid promotes proliferation of adipocytes and deposition of collagen fibers in the extracellular matrix and around capillary and collecting lymphatics. </p><p>Lymphedema is a low-output failure of the lymphovascular system (ie, lymph transport is reduced). It is important to note that the rate of capillary filtration is normal in patients with lymphedema, in contrast to those with generalized edematous states, for which intact lymphatics are overwhelmed by an excessive amount of capillary infiltrate (ie, high-output failure of the lymphatics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In some cases where high-output failure of the lymphatic system is chronic (eg, recurrent infection, thermal burns, chronic venous insufficiency), a mixed form of <span class=\"nowrap\">edema/lymphedema</span> can develop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-edema-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphedema without an inciting factor, termed primary lymphedema, is generally due to a congenital or inherited condition associated with pathologic development of the lymphatic vessels. Primary lymphedema often presents in childhood, but later presentations in adulthood also occur. </p><p>Primary lymphedema is classified by the age at onset. Congenital lymphedema is defined by swelling that is present at birth or up to two years postnatally. Lymphedema praecox typically arises during puberty or pregnancy with onset prior to age 35 years, and lymphedema tarda presents with an onset after age 35. Conditions associated with primary lymphedema in children are discussed separately.

Primary lymphedema does occur in upper extremity, and in one small series of 60 patients, the incidence was higher in males (2:1 male: female) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The mean age at diagnosis was 38 years (range, 3 to 82 years), and the majority of cases were not associated with a recognized genetic condition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H213980183\"><span class=\"h3\">Secondary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphedema that occurs as the result of other conditions or treatments is termed secondary lymphedema. Secondary causes of lymphedema include cancer and cancer treatment, infection, inflammatory disorders, obesity, and chronic forms of lymphatic overload (eg, chronic venous insufficiency, <span class=\"nowrap\">trauma/burns)</span>. These are discussed in detail below.

Worldwide, the most common cause of lymphedema is filariasis, due to infection by the nematode <em>Wuchereria bancrofti </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the developed world, the majority of cases of lymphedema are secondary and due to malignancy or its treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/8,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11-13</a>].

In a systematic review that included 72 studies (n = 29,612 women), the pooled incidence of upper extremity lymphedema for breast cancer survivors was 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The greatest incidence was within the first two years following the cancer diagnosis. It is estimated that nearly three-fourths of women who will develop lymphedema after axillary lymph node dissection do so within three years of surgery. The incidence varied based on the mode of diagnosis. Based on clinical diagnosis, limb measurements, and self-assessment, the incidence was 13, 15, and 20 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H802880404\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Other malignancies are also associated with an increased risk of lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/10,13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,20</a>].

As an example, a patient with breast cancer may complain of swelling over the ipsilateral breast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> upper chest wall. In chronic lymphedema, large amounts of subcutaneous tissue may form, the genesis of which is incompletely understood. Patients may develop a restricted range of motion in the affected limb as a result of the increased weight, which may limit their ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and affect body image. </p><p>The physical exam should evaluate the vascular system, skin, and soft tissue and include palpation of the lymph nodes. Two-thirds of cases of lymphedema are unilateral, although the laterality depends on the precipitating event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. As an example, an axillary node dissection will increase the risk of lymphedema in the ipsilateral upper extremity while a pelvic node dissection increases the risk of bilateral lower extremity edema. </p><p>At onset, swelling in the affected limb is typically characterized as &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;pitting.&quot; Pitting reflects movement of the excess interstitial water in response to pressure. Testing for pitting involves applying firm pressure to the edematous tissue for at least five seconds. If an indentation remains after the pressure is released, pitting edema is present. Pitting is variable in patients with lymphedema and is generally absent with progressive lymphedema. With worsening lymphedema, dermal thickening becomes clinically apparent and the skin becomes dry and firm with less pitting due to cutaneous fibrosis and adipose deposition. The overlying skin of the affected limb also becomes hyperkeratotic, which can lead to verrucous and vesicular skin lesions. </p><p>A positive Stemmer sign is indicative of lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. It is characterized by a thickened skin fold at the base of the second toe or second finger. The examiner's inability to lift the skin of the affected limb compared with the contralateral limb is a positive sign. It is also described as difficulty lifting the skin of the dorsum of the fingers or toes of the affected limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A positive Stemmer sign can be found in any stage of lymphedema. While it is possible to have a false negative Stemmer sign, a false positive sign is rare. </p><p>If primary lymphedema is suspected, evaluation should include documentation of any physical signs or congenital anomalies associated with an inherited condition.

Lymphedema is distinguished from CVI by an absence of typical varicose veins, an absence of characteristic skin change distribution (ie, brawny discoloration at the medial ankle in CVI), and alleviation of symptoms and reduction of swelling with limb elevation. Duplex ultrasound will demonstrate typical findings of venous valvular insufficiency. However, a subset of patients with longstanding and severe chronic venous insufficiency may develop concurrent lymphedema.

These include pain, venous dilation, edema, pigmentation, skin changes, and venous ulcers. A prior history of DVT can distinguish this condition from lymphedema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-thrombotic-postphlebitic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-thrombotic (postphlebitic) syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limb hypertrophy &ndash; Several syndromes are characterized by limb size discrepancies that may be due to hypertrophy of the soft tissue and bones (ie, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome), or overgrowth of body parts in a disproportionate fashion (ie, Proteus syndrome), that may affect one or more limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. These syndromes are associated with other clinical manifestations, such as capillary malformations, which may help to distinguish them from lymphedema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capillary-malformations-port-wine-stains-and-associated-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Capillary malformations (port wine stains) and associated syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipedema &ndash; Lipedema is a rare adipose disorder characterized as the abnormal deposition of fat with associated edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. A pedigree analysis suggests it is inherited as an X-linked dominant or autosomal dominant condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. It almost exclusively occurs in women and is associated with minimal pitting edema. Patients may complain of pain and tenderness and sustain easy bruising. Elevating the limbs has no effect on the involved limbs. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myxedema &ndash; Myxedema results from infiltration of the skin by glycosaminoglycans with associated water retention leading to nonpitting edema.

In particular, recurrence of the breast cancer in the axillary area or the development of lymphangiosarcoma should be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4164169\"><span class=\"h1\">FURTHER EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging can be helpful to distinguish lymphedema from nonlymphatic causes of edema if the diagnosis of lymphedema is not immediately apparent based upon history, physical examination, and extremity measurements. We recommend duplex ultrasound for all patients with new-onset extremity swelling. Ultrasound can be used to exclude other etiologies in the differential diagnosis (eg deep venous thrombosis [DVT], venous insufficiency) but also directly aids in the diagnosis by identifying a mass that might be the cause of lymphatic compression, identifying tissue alterations, and demonstrating live nematodes in scrotal filariasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Unfortunately, all of these imaging studies suffer from a lack of standardized techniques, resulting in variable results. The protocols used for lymphoscintigraphy, in particular, can be highly variable. Nevertheless, in centers that specialize in lymphatic disorders, protocols that use varying techniques can depict the specific lymphatic dysfunction. </p><p>Lymphoscintigraphy images the flow of macromolecules and interstitial fluid from the skin to the lymph nodes, particularly in the extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/2,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,64</a>]. Subcutaneous or intradermal radioactive tracers are injected in the web space of the extremities, and imaging is performed 30 to 120 minutes after injection. The patient then performs a stress activity (such as walking, massage, or squeezing a ball for approximately 20 minutes), which is followed by repeat imaging. Criteria for impaired lymphatic function for qualitative lymphoscintigraphy include delayed, asymmetric, or absent visualization of the regional lymph nodes and dermal backflow. Quantitation of regional lymph node accumulation of the tracer appears to be more sensitive than qualitative lymphoscintigraphy (100 versus 70 percent in a series of 219 patients with secondary or primary lymphedema) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. All cases missed with qualitative lymphoscintigraphy were mild grade I disease. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Indocyanine green</a> (ICG) lymphangiography is one technique in which a near-infrared dye (indocyanine green) is injected intradermally. The dye is bound by albumin after injection, and uptake is therefore restricted to the lymphatics. The lymphatic vasculature can then be directly imaged with specialized sensors. Lymphatic vessel anatomy, leaking, pumping capacity, and dermal reflux can all be seen. This is currently an off-label use of ICG; nevertheless, many lymphatic surgeons rely on ICG imaging for preoperative analysis and staging of lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p>More commonly available imaging techniques, including CT and MR imaging, can demonstrate accumulation of fluid within soft tissues of the extremity with good sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/44,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,68</a>]. In one study of 55 patients who underwent both CT and lymphoscintigraphy, CT had a sensitivity and specificity of 93 and 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Major CT findings for patients with lymphedema were skin thickening (95 percent), subcutaneous edema accumulation (95 percent), and a honeycombed appearance (41 percent). For demonstrating the lymphatic channels, MR has many advantages; however, the injected contrast material taken up by the lymphatics is also taken up by nearby veins. The lymphatics are typically beaded in appearance with the veins and have a higher signal intensity, but judgment is needed to distinguish them. Specialized MR techniques are being developed to exclude venous uptake, but these are not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40511035\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients diagnosed with primary lymphedema or suspected of lymphedema tarda, referral to a medical geneticist or genetic counselling service is suggested for evaluation of the family history and recommendations for further workup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].
