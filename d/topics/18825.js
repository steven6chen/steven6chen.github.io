Between January and March 2018, 10 travel-related cases, including 4 deaths, were reported among international travelers returning from Brazil; none of the 10 travelers had received yellow fever vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The Brazilian Ministry of Health has issued a recommendation for universal yellow fever vaccination for residents in Brazil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory in March 2018 reminding travelers of the importance of yellow fever vaccination prior to travel to high-risk areas and expanding the regions within Brazil for which pre-travel vaccination is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

We suggest RZV rather than ZVL for most patients who meet criteria for vaccination. RZV appears to provide greater protection against herpes zoster, and there is less concern for waning immunity. The choice of RZV as the preferred type of vaccine is consistent with recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Disadvantages of RZV are the need for two doses (versus one with ZVL), and an increased risk of mild to moderate side effects (pain at the injection site, myalgia, fatigue, headache, fever) that typically resolve in one to three days. These factors rarely prevent patients from completing the RZV series. For patients who previously received ZVL, we suggest revaccination with RZV. The optimal use of RZV in immunocompromised patients is still to be determined.

Now, a meta-analysis including 16 studies reported that the incidence of cervical cancer was reduced by about one-third in IUD users compared with nonusers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This protective effect is particularly important for women at higher risk of cervical cancer, such as those who have not received the human papillomavirus vaccine or who do not have access to cervical cancer screening. It is not known if the type of device influences the reduction in cervical cancer risk.

In the largest prospective study to date of over 160,000 healthy, nonobese adults, self-reported sleep duration &lt;6 hours per day was associated with the development of multiple cardiometabolic risk factors over an 18-year follow-up period, including central obesity, elevated fasting glucose, hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, and metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Increases in relative risk ranged from 6 to 12 percent for each individual factor.

In addition to the total daily duration of sitting, the risk of mortality may be higher among those who sit for prolonged, uninterrupted periods as compared with those who sit for shorter, interrupted periods. In a study of nearly 8000 middle-aged and older adults, sedentary time was measured with an accelerometer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Both total sedentary time and episodes of prolonged, uninterrupted inactivity were associated with higher risk for death. Those participants with high sedentary time (&ge;12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/day)</span> and longer episodes of inactivity (&ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/episode)</span> had the highest risk for death.

In a recent best practice statement, the American College of Physicians and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised HBV testing in patients with elevated aminotransferases and in asymptomatic individuals at high risk for exposure or severe adverse outcomes with a missed diagnosis (eg, those requiring immunosuppressive therapy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55052\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55052 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Screening allows for vaccination of high-risk uninfected individuals and linkage to appropriate medical care for patients with chronic infection or risk for reactivation of resolved infection.

In new guidelines, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC) recommends one-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The CTFPHC recommendation extends the upper age limit (75 years) recommended by others, including the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and does not differentiate by smoking status. UpToDate and the USPSTF recommend screening men age 65 to 75 who smoke and only selectively screening never-smokers.

Reasons for reintervention included device malfunction and treatment failure. Although some trials of SNM for OAB have found symptom improvement rates of 90 percent and cure rates up to 50 percent, the rate of reintervention should be considered in selecting treatment options when noninvasive therapies do not achieve sufficient symptom reduction.

However, in a trial of 609 overweight adults who were randomly assigned to a healthy low-fat diet or a healthy low-carbohydrate diet, both groups experienced comparable weight loss, and there were no interactions between weight loss and low-fat sensitive or low-carbohydrate sensitive genotypes or baseline insulin secretion levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This finding is consistent with our approach emphasizing adherence and healthy food choices over specific macronutrient composition.

In a recent randomized trial, the use of PERC prior to conventional assessment (which included measuring a D-dimer level to determine further testing) did not alter the diagnostic rate of PE compared with conventional assessment alone. However, the PERC-based strategy did result in a 10 percent reduction in the use of computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. We continue to suggest using PERC when evaluating patients in whom there is a low suspicion for PE.

In a retrospective cohort study of patients treated over a four-year period at a specialty referral facility offering hyperbaric oxygen treatment, 61 patients treated for carbon monoxide poisoning had a history of exposure to waterpipe smoking. The most common symptoms were syncope, dizziness, headache, and nausea. Clinicians should be alert to this risk and warn patients of this potential consequence of waterpipe use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patterns-of-tobacco-use#H1713552768\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patterns of tobacco use&quot;, section on 'Waterpipes or hookahs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116389\"><span class=\"h2\">Tobacco use rates vary among occupations (January 2018)</span></p><p>The association between occupation and tobacco use rates among United States working adults shows considerable variation, both in overall rates of use and in usage of specific categories of tobacco products. Cigarette smoking rates ranged from approximately 25 percent (construction workers and workers in accommodation and food service industries) to just over 5 percent (workers in education and workers in life, physical, and social sciences) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Use of two or more tobacco products was highest (10 percent) among workers in installation, maintenance, and repair.

However, a prospective cohort study found higher all-cause mortality and cancer incidence among people aged 59 to 82 who consistently smoked 10 or fewer cigarettes a day than among never-smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Even smoking less than one cigarette daily was associated with higher mortality and cancer rates. Quitting smoking lowered the risks; the younger the age at quitting, the lower the risks. Sharing such data with patients may help to encourage quitting smoking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation#H99356499\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of smoking cessation&quot;, section on 'Questionable utility of smoking reduction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116207\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety of MRI in patients with cardiac devices (January 2018)</span></p><p>Potential risks of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with permanent pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) include programming changes, pacing abnormalities, and induced currents in lead wires. In a series of 1509 patients with older generation pacemakers or ICDs (eg, those that don&rsquo;t specifically meet MRI-conditional criteria specified by the Food and Drug Administration, or &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; devices) who underwent thoracic or non-thoracic MRI examinations and were followed for one year, there were no clinically significant events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. While this and earlier reports are reassuring, the presence of a non-MRI-conditional pacemaker or ICD requires precautionary measures including device programming before and after MRI and patient monitoring during the imaging procedure, with availability of a defibrillator and code cart. If the examination is indicated and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness, MR imaging in patients with non-MRI-conditional permanent pacemakers or ICDs can be undertaken provided specific precautionary measures are in place. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'Permanent pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116197\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential for burns from electronic nicotine delivery systems (January 2018)</span></p><p>Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) serve as heat generators for e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn (HNB) cigarettes. Added to the risk related to chemical constituents produced during use of an ENDS, there is a risk of burns due to device malfunction. Burns to local tissue have occurred while an ENDS device was stored (eg, in a pants pocket) or during its use, resulting in burns to the thigh, groin, face, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. While reported previously, this risk may not be widely recognized among clinicians or users of ENDS.

A large epidemiologic study (Nurses&rsquo; Health Study) recently found that women with a history of GDM who did not progress to type 2 diabetes also had a small absolute increase in risk of CVD, which was attenuated by but persisted after adjusting for lifestyle risk factors for CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These data further support our recommendation to discuss healthy lifestyle behaviors (heart-healthy diet, maintenance of a healthy weight, tobacco avoidance, and physical activity) with all women who have had GDM.

In this context, questions arise about the risks of proceeding to surgery with uncorrected underlying abnormalities versus the risks of delaying surgery to perform a thorough preoperative assessment and optimize preoperative status. In a retrospective cohort study of over 40,000 patients, patients who had surgery for hip fracture within 24 hours of admission had lower 30-day mortality than patients who had surgery more than 24 hours after admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The results of this study support UpToDate's recommendation to perform surgery within 24 hours in patients who are medically stable. Patients with active medical comorbidities may require evaluation and stabilization of these issues before proceeding to surgery, but this should be done as quickly as possible.

A safety warning from the US Food and Drug Administration has been issued. There is insufficient information to guide the formulation of firm recommendations regarding this clinical scenario; our approach is presented. Clinicians should be aware of this issue and query patients about biotin or vitamin intake. When troponin results are unexpected, it is reasonable to further observe the patient and repeat the troponin test.

In a review of meta-analyses of largely observational studies of multiple health outcomes, coffee consumption was more often associated with benefit than with harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-primary-care/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Drinking three to four cups of coffee per day was associated with the greatest benefit. Harmful associations were largely absent after adjustment for smoking except in pregnancy, where high consumption was associated with an increase in risk of low birth weight, preterm delivery, and pregnancy loss. Given the limitations of observational studies, UpToDate neither promotes nor discourages coffee consumption in nonpregnant adults but discourages more than 200 to 300 mg of caffeine intake per day in women who are pregnant or attempting to conceive.
