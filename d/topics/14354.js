Advances in drug development have allowed for more potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens that are easier to take, resulting in fewer patients who develop drug-resistant strains of HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, there remains a subset of patients infected with drug-resistant variants, which can challenge an HIV clinician. </p><p>While resistance mutation patterns can be complex, there are basic principles that underlie effective utilization of resistance data. This topic will review the resistance patterns found in association with different antiretroviral agents and describe how that knowledge can impact selection of an appropriate treatment regimen in patients with virologic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The details in this topic refer mainly to resistance patterns seen with HIV subtype B, which is the most prevalent clade in the United States, Europe, Japan, Thailand, and Australia. </p><p>Topic reviews that discuss the different types of resistance tests and provide detailed guidance on selecting an ART regimen are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing-assays\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of HIV drug resistance testing assays&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-treatment-experienced-patient-failing-hiv-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the treatment-experienced patient failing HIV therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-an-antiretroviral-regimen-for-treatment-experienced-hiv-infected-patients-who-are-failing-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting an antiretroviral regimen for treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients who are failing therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hiv-2-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of HIV-2 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2548093486\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple factors influence the development of HIV drug resistance, including the biology of HIV, genetic barriers to resistance, regimen potency, pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs, and medication adherence. Drug-resistant mutations can predate the initiation of a specific drug regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] or can develop when viral replication continues in the face of ongoing drug pressure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HIV biology</strong> &ndash; HIV infection is characterized by high rates of replication, with more than 10<sup>9</sup> virions produced daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, HIV reverse transcriptase, which is responsible for replicating the viral genome, is error-prone. The combination of the high rate of replication and the frequent introduction of mutations during each round of replication leads to the occurrence of randomly generated mutations, some of which confer drug resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The resulting population of genetically related, but distinct, HIV variants in a patient is referred to as a &quot;quasispecies.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Viruses with spontaneous mutations are often defective and incapable of replication. However, some mutations can persist in proviral HIV DNA in resting memory cells if the mutant virus has a selective growth advantage over wild-type virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If viral replication is not fully suppressed by an antiretroviral regimen, these mutants can emerge. Depending on their level of drug resistance, these mutants can either cause overt virologic failure or become more drug resistant by the gradual accumulation of additional resistance mutations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic barriers to resistance</strong> &ndash; HIV can develop high-level resistance to some drugs with only a single mutation, while other drugs require multiple mutations. Drugs in the former situation are referred to as having a &quot;low genetic barrier&quot; to resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antiretroviral-agents-used-to-treat-hiv\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several antiretroviral agents have a low genetic barrier to resistance. These include the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> (and the closely related agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rilpivirine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rilpivirine</a>, and the integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elvitegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">elvitegravir</a>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By contrast, a high resistance barrier is seen in the protease inhibitor (PI) class (except for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nelfinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nelfinavir</a>) and with the INSTI <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a>. Resistance to these agents usually requires the accumulation of multiple mutations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Regimen potency</strong> &ndash; The potency of an antiretroviral regimen is a crucial determinant of viral load suppression. If the viral load is not fully suppressed, continued virus replication in the presence of drug can lead to the accumulation of mutations. This can lead to the development of viral resistance, even to drugs with a high genetic barrier to resistance. As an example, unboosted PIs have a high genetic barrier to resistance but achieve low serum trough concentrations; thus, virus can continue to replicate and accumulate mutations that lead to high levels of resistance. This problem can be offset by the use of pharmacokinetic &quot;boosting&quot; with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cobicistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cobicistat</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antiretroviral-agents-used-to-treat-hiv#H1322359219\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV&quot;, section on 'Protease inhibitors (PIs)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This principle was illustrated in a trial in which 653 treatment-na&iuml;ve patients were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> in combination with a PI, either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lopinavir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lopinavir-ritonavir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nelfinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nelfinavir</a> (a less potent PI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. After 48 weeks of follow-up, the emergence of resistance and virologic failure was more common in patients in the nelfinavir arm compared with the lopinavir arm. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pharmacokinetic factors</strong> &ndash; There are several ways that pharmacokinetic factors can lead to drug resistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Low serum concentrations</strong> &ndash; Low serum concentrations of an antiretroviral agent can be seen as a result of drug interactions, poor absorption, or secondary to the pharmacokinetics of a specific agent (eg, unboosted PIs). Continued virus replication in the presence of drug can lead to the accumulation of mutations. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Varying half-lives</strong> &ndash; Resistance can result when individual components of an HIV antiretroviral regimen have varying plasma half-lives. In this case, discontinuation of the regimen can lead to functional monotherapy. As an example, when the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-emtricitabine-and-tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz-emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> is discontinued, the half-life of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> is longer than the half-lives of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a>, and the patient may be at risk of developing efavirenz resistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Genetic factors</strong> &ndash; Pharmacokinetic profiles can vary significantly in different patient populations. This pharmacokinetic variability was well illustrated in a study of 152 patients who were receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>, which is metabolized primarily by cytochrome p450 2B6 isoenzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A G-to-T polymorphism at position 516 of CYP2B6 was associated with higher plasma efavirenz concentrations and slower clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is of theoretical utility to ensure that there is adequate drug exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. PIs and NNRTIs are potential candidates for TDM, since serum concentration-response relationships have been well documented. However, the role of TDM in clinical practice remains controversial because of the lack of prospective studies demonstrating that TDM improves clinical outcome in patients with drug-resistant HIV. In addition, plasma NRTI concentrations are not thought to be as important clinically due to the intracellular location of their active forms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medication adherence</strong> &ndash; Nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy is closely associated with incomplete viral suppression and the development of drug-resistant HIV variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The relationship between adherence and drug resistance is complex and influenced by drug potency, pill burden, and pharmacokinetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

A patient may become infected by either a wild-type or a resistant strain. As there are many HIV viral variants that are considered &quot;wild type,&quot; all are compared to a reference strain in laboratories that perform drug resistance testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19102152\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral fitness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral fitness generally refers to the ability of one virus to out-compete a second virus in a defined environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>]. In general, wild-type virus replicates more efficiently (ie, is more &quot;fit&quot;) in cell culture than resistant virus and overgrows mutant variants in the absence of drug selection pressure.</p><p>In the setting of drug therapy, drug-resistant virus is selected, despite that it is less fit in the absence of drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Viral variants with reduced fitness may be less pathogenic, although studies examining the correlation of HIV replication fitness with clinical outcome have not given consistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19102159\"><span class=\"h2\">Replication capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Replication capacity refers to the ability of the virus to replicate in comparison to another reference virus. Replication capacity can either decrease or increase in the presence of certain mutations. </p><p>In the early era of potent antiretroviral therapy, some patients demonstrated transient immunologic benefit despite ongoing viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This may have been related to the selection of a &quot;less fit&quot; drug-resistant virus population. Viral fitness is inferred through measurement of replication capacity, which can be obtained from one phenotypic assay, PhenoSense HIV (Monogram Biosciences, Clinical Reference Laboratory). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing-assays\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of HIV drug resistance testing assays&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the primary goal is always complete viral suppression, which is associated with durable immunologic benefit. Viral suppression is usually achievable with currently available antiretroviral medications, even among patients with multi-class drug resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>].

For example, &quot;M184V&quot; indicates that valine has been substituted for methionine at amino acid codon 184 in the reverse transcriptase enzyme. The notation <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;M184M/V&quot;</span> indicates the presence of a mixture of wild-type (M) and mutant (V) virus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Signature mutation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A &quot;signature mutation&quot; is a mutation that is typically associated with resistance to a particular drug. As an example, the K103N mutation is the signature mutation for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Other signature mutations are described below. (See <a href=\"#H2378582506\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of resistance mutations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cross-resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;cross-resistance&quot; refers to resistance to drugs other than the drug that selected the mutation(s). As examples, the M184V mutation associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> confers cross-resistance to the related drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>, and the K103N mutation selected by the NNRTIs <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a> confer cross-resistance to each other. However, a specific mutation may not cause cross-resistance to all agents within a class. Although virus expressing the K103N is resistant to nevirapine and efavirenz, other NNRTIs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etravirine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etravirine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rilpivirine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rilpivirine</a>, maintain activity if there are no other additional NNRTI mutations. Similarly, a mutation at position Y143 can confer resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a> but has little effect on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a> susceptibility. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H737831544\" class=\"local\">'Integrase strand transfer inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypersusceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On occasion, resistance to one drug can lead to increased susceptibility, or hypersusceptibility, to another drug. For example, the M184V mutation that confers <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> resistance causes hypersusceptibility to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> and tenofovir compared with wild-type virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Another example is the TAM T215Y, which is associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> hypersusceptibility when present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Accessory mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When HIV continues to replicate, additional minor mutations may accumulate over time. These accessory or secondary mutations further increase drug resistance or can compensate for the loss of viral fitness induced by the primary mutations. Thus, it is important to switch antiretroviral therapy rather than expose a patient with ongoing viremia to the same drugs in order to avoid the accumulation of additional mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Patterns of mutations can be complex, and interpretations can change over time as more information is obtained regarding the relationship between drug resistance mutations and response to therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H896707310\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistance testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resistance testing is important to help guide treatment decisions in both treatment-na&iuml;ve and treatment-experienced patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Drug-resistant mutations may be related to transmission of a drug-resistant virus at the time of initial infection or may arise due to continued virus replication in the presence of drug (eg, patients who do not take their regimen as prescribed). A discussion of HIV drug resistance assays is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing-assays\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of HIV drug resistance testing assays&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In treatment-experienced patients with virologic failure, it is preferable to obtain resistance testing while the patient is taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) or is within weeks of discontinuing treatment; however this might not be possible in patients who are nonadherent to their regimen. In the absence of drug pressure, the wild-type HIV strain may become dominant. Although some mutations may persist off ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], the results can be misleading if drug resistance testing is performed when patients are not receiving ART. Similarly, resistance testing is less reliable at detecting resistance to classes of drugs no longer being taken. These limitations emphasize the importance of taking a complete medication history.

TAMs continue to accumulate when patients continue failing ART regimens.</p><p>The first TAM pathway listed above confers cross-resistance to all NRTIs and the nucleotide analog, tenofovir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/22,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,30,31</a>].

Since zidovudine and stavudine are both thymidine analogs, resistance to zidovudine results in cross-resistance to stavudine, and vice versa. </p><p>TAMs are uncommon with early failure of a thymidine analog-containing regimen. At least three TAMs are usually required before virologic activity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> is completely lost. However, continuation of a thymidine analog-containing regimen in the presence of ongoing viremia will result in accumulation of additional TAMs, leading to greater resistance and NRTI cross-resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].
