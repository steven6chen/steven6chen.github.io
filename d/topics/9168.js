There was no history of claudication. These findings are consistent with neuropathic, not ischemic, pain. These findings allow you to reassure the patient that the circulation is intact and that vascular surgery and amputation are not necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Pharmacologic management of painful diabetic neuropathy is aimed at alleviation of symptoms, so it is important to determine whether the pain interferes with sleep or other activities of daily living. This was true in the patients under consideration. Otherwise, reassurance that the circulation is intact, to the extent possible based on your evaluation, may be sufficient.</p><p>There are several classes of medications that can alleviate the pain of distal sensory diabetic neuropathy. The choice among effective agents should be determined by the comorbidities or contraindications to these agents and by the cost when other factors are equal. In the 29-year-old woman described above, a tricyclic agent was an appropriate first choice. There was no contraindication to its use, the presence of depression was an additional indication, and the cost is low.</p><p>In the 69-year-old man, the presence of benign prostatic hypertrophy with symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction was a contraindication to the use of a tricyclic agent. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pregabalin</a>, an effective and easy-to-use agent, was an appropriate first choice, even though it is more expensive.</p><p>The treatment of diabetic neuropathy is discussed in more detail elsewhere.
