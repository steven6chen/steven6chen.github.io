The incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza was significantly reduced when oseltamivir was used as seasonal prophylaxis in a healthy population (odds ratio [OR] 0.26, 95% CI 0.08-0.84), as postexposure prophylaxis in the household setting (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.04-0.29), or as seasonal prophylaxis in a long-term care facility that housed elderly individuals (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.61). The incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza was also significantly reduced when zanamivir was used as seasonal prophylaxis in a healthy population (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.64) or as postexposure prophylaxis in the household setting (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.09-0.38).</p><p>A 2006 meta-analysis that included only trials of healthy adults showed similar reductions in the incidence of influenza with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zanamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zanamivir</a> prophylaxis (relative risk [RR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.18-0.85 and 0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.85, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-seasonal-influenza-with-antiviral-drugs-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In a 2014 systematic review of unpublished clinical study reports from three randomized prophylaxis trials obtained from the European Medicines Agency and the manufacturer of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a>, oseltamivir reduced the rate of symptomatic influenza in individuals (risk ratio [RR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.30-0.67; risk difference 3.05%, 95% CI 1.83-3.88 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-seasonal-influenza-with-antiviral-drugs-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

However, there was moderate heterogeneity between studies. Zanamivir reduced the risk of self-reported investigator-mediated unverified pneumonia in adults (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.80). Zanamivir did not reduce the risk of asymptomatic influenza in prophylaxis of individuals or postexposure prophylaxis of households.</p><p>Laninamivir, a long-acting inhaled neuraminidase inhibitor, was reported to be effective for preventing influenza infection in the household contacts of patients with influenza. In a randomized trial conducted in Japan, family members living with a patient with influenza infection (most of whom had influenza A H3N2 infection) within 48 hours of symptom onset were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of 40 mg of laninamivir, two doses of 20 mg of laninamivir given daily for two days, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-seasonal-influenza-with-antiviral-drugs-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The proportion of participants who developed clinical influenza that was confirmed by laboratory testing was significantly lower in the laninamivir groups than in the placebo group (4.5 percent in the laninamivir single-dose group, 4.5 percent in the laninamivir two-dose group, and 12.1 percent in the placebo group).
