Other causes of facial pain are discussed separately.

It has three major divisions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ophthalmic (V1)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maxillary (V2)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mandibular (V3)</p><p/><p>The nerve starts at the midlateral surface of the pons, and its sensory ganglion (gasserian ganglion) resides in Meckel's cave in the floor of the middle cranial fossa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TN is a rare condition that affects women more than men. The annual incidence of TN is 4 to 13 per 100,000 people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Despite its low incidence, TN is one of the more frequently seen neuralgias in the older adult population. The incidence increases gradually with age; most idiopathic cases begin after age 50, although onset may occur in the second and third decades or, rarely, in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The male to female prevalence ratio of TN ranges from 1:1.5 to 1:1.7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This female predominance may be related to the increased longevity of women compared with men. Rare familial cases have been reported, but the vast majority of patients have sporadic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Although data are not entirely consistent, hypertension may be a risk factor for the development of trigeminal neuralgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/5,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8-10</a>]. There is also some evidence that migraine is a risk factor for TN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of TN are caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve root, usually within a few millimeters of entry into the pons (the root entry zone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Compression by an aberrant loop of an artery or vein is thought to account for 80 to 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Idiopathic TN or TN caused by a vascular compression is considered classic TN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> below.)</p><p>Other causes of TN via nerve compression include vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma), meningioma, epidermoid or other cyst, or, rarely, a saccular aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-21</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which compression of the nerve leads to symptoms appears to be related to demyelination in a circumscribed area around the compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Precisely how demyelination results in the symptoms of TN is not entirely clear. Demyelinated lesions may set up ectopic impulse generation, possibly causing ephaptic transmission. Ephaptic cross-talk between fibers mediating light touch and those involved in pain generation could account for the precipitation of painful attacks by light tactile stimulation of facial trigger zones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Furthermore, alteration of afferent input may disinhibit pain pathways in the spinal trigeminal nucleus.</p><p>Evidence for a role of central pain mechanisms includes the presence of refractory periods after a triggered episode, trains of painful sensations after a single stimulus, and latency from the time of stimulation to the onset of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, electrophysiologic evidence of central sensitization of trigeminal nociceptive processing has been observed in patients with atypical TN who have concomitant chronic facial pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Demyelination of one or more of the trigeminal nerve nuclei may also be caused by multiple sclerosis or other structural lesions of the brainstem. In multiple sclerosis, a plaque of demyelination typically occurs in the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], although vascular compression also has been noted in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3), TN is divided into classic (or classical) trigeminal neuralgia caused by neurovascular compression and painful trigeminal neuropathy caused by a number of other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic TN encompasses both idiopathic TN cases and those related to vascular compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The rationale is as follows. The ICHD-3 acknowledges that TN found to be related to compression of the trigeminal nerve by a vascular loop, as demonstrated by surgery, should strictly be regarded as secondary. However, most patients do not have surgery, and it is often uncertain as to whether they have primary or secondary neuralgia. For this reason, the ICHD-3 uses the term &quot;classical&quot; instead of &quot;primary&quot; for patients with a typical history of TN who have a presumed or demonstrated vascular source of compression as the cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painful trigeminal neuropathy is caused by lesions other than vascular compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Painful trigeminal neuropathy attributed to acute herpes zoster</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Postherpetic trigeminal neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Painful posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Painful trigeminal neuropathy attributed to multiple sclerosis plaque</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Painful trigeminal neuropathy attributed to space-occupying lesion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Painful trigeminal neuropathy attributed to other disorder</p><p/><p>However, this ICHD-3 classification scheme for painful trigeminal neuropathy is problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]; clinical experience suggests a substantial number of patients with symptoms that are virtually identical to classic TN and with normal neurologic examinations turn out to have a secondary cause such as multiple sclerosis or a tumor along the trigeminal nerve. Furthermore, such patients often respond well to the same drugs useful for classic TN. Accordingly, while the ICHD-3 classifies such cases as having &quot;painful trigeminal neuropathy,&quot; we favor classifying them as having &quot;secondary TN&quot; because it more accurately reflects the clinical characteristics and management options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TN is defined clinically by paroxysmal, stereotyped attacks of usually intense, sharp, superficial, or stabbing pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial (trigeminal) nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70877\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70877 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The pain of TN tends to occur in paroxysms and is maximal at or near onset. Facial muscle spasms can be seen with severe pain. This finding gave rise to the older term for this disorder, tic douloureux. The pain is often described as electric, shock-like, or stabbing. It usually lasts from one to several seconds, but may occur repetitively. A refractory period of several minutes during which a paroxysm cannot be provoked is common. Some patients with longstanding TN may have continuous dull pain that is present between paroxysms of pain. Unlike some other facial pain syndromes, TN typically does not awaken patients at night.</p><p>TN is typically unilateral. Occasionally the pain is bilateral, though rarely on both sides simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The distribution of pain most often involves the V2 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> V3 subdivisions of the trigeminal nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Autonomic symptoms, usually mild or moderate, can occur in association with attacks of TN in the V1 trigeminal distribution, including lacrimation, conjunctival injection, and rhinorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/6,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,31,32</a>]. However, isolated involvement of the V1 subdivision occurs in &lt;5 percent of patients with TN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The presence of autonomic features, particularly when prominent or severe, is suggestive of the syndromes of short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with autonomic symptoms (SUNA). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Trigger zones in the distribution of the affected nerve may be present and are often located near the midline. Lightly touching these zones often triggers an attack, leading patients to protect these areas. Trigger zones can sometimes be demonstrated on physical examination. Other triggers of TN paroxysms include chewing, talking, brushing teeth, cold air, smiling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> grimacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Some patients have a history of &quot;pretrigeminal neuralgia,&quot; a dull, continuous, aching pain in the jaw that evolves over time into TN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. This brief, milder pain is sometimes suspected to have a dental origin, and unnecessary dental procedures have been performed in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. On the other hand, TN can be precipitated by dental procedures (eg, dental extraction), resulting in increased confusion about the precise etiology of this problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The course of TN is variable, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H539036576\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of TN is based upon the characteristic clinical features described above, primarily paroxysms of pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Once the diagnosis of TN is suspected on clinical grounds, a search for secondary causes should be undertaken (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101663\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101663 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>For all patients with suspected TN or those with recurrent attacks of pain limited to one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve and no obvious cause (eg, herpes zoster or trigeminal nerve trauma), we recommend neuroimaging to help distinguish classic TN (ie, idiopathic TN or TN caused by vascular compression) from secondary TN (ie, painful trigeminal neuropathy caused by structural brain lesion other than vascular compression). Neuroimaging of the brain can be done with MRI or CT, though MRI with and without contrast is much preferred because its higher resolution enables imaging the trigeminal nerve and small adjacent lesions.</p><p>Patients with trigeminal sensory loss or bilateral involvement are probably at higher risk of secondary TN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Younger age is also probably associated with a higher risk of secondary TN. However, age is not a clinically useful predictor for distinguishing classic TN from secondary TN because there is considerable age overlap. In addition, absence of any of these clinical features (sensory loss, bilateral involvement, younger age) does not rule out a secondary cause for TN.</p><p>Electrophysiologic testing does not clearly distinguish classic TN from secondary TN and has no established role in the diagnostic evaluation of TN. However, a 2008 guideline suggested that trigeminal reflex testing was probably useful for distinguishing classic TN from secondary TN while trigeminal evoked potentials were not useful for making this distinction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria for classic TN are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A) At least three attacks of unilateral facial pain fulfilling criteria B and C</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B) Occurring in one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve, with no radiation beyond the trigeminal distribution</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C) Pain has at least three of the following four characteristics:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recurring in paroxysmal attacks lasting from a fraction of a second to two minutes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe intensity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Electric shock-like, shooting, stabbing, or sharp in quality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At least three attacks precipitated by innocuous stimuli to the affected side of the face (some attacks may be, or appear to be, spontaneous)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D) No clinically evident neurologic deficit</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>E) Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis</p><p/><p>Occasional patients who fulfill these criteria for classic TN may have persistent facial pain of moderate intensity in the affected area, thereby meeting ICHD-3 criteria for classic TN with concomitant persistent facial pain, also known as atypical trigeminal neuralgia or trigeminal neuralgia type 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The ICHD-3 notes that the finding of hypoesthesia or hypoalgesia in the affected trigeminal region always indicates axonal damage and therefore a trigeminal neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], though not all experts agree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In such cases, an extensive diagnostic work-up may be necessary to identify the cause (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above). In contrast, hyperalgesia in the painful region should not necessarily lead to a diagnosis of secondary TN or trigeminal neuropathy because it may reflect increased attention to the painful side.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroimaging with head MRI (or CT if MRI is not an option) is useful for identifying the small proportion of patients who have a structural lesion (eg, tumor in the cerebellopontine angle, demyelinating lesions including multiple sclerosis) as the cause of painful trigeminal neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In addition, high resolution MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may be useful for identifying vascular compression as the etiology of classic TN, but the utility of these studies has not been established.</p><p>We recommend obtaining brain MRI with and without contrast to rule out a causative structural brain lesion for all patients presenting with suspected TN. High-resolution MRI with thin cuts through the region of the trigeminal ganglion and heavy T2 weighting (eg, a constructive interference in steady-state [CISS] fusion study), is the preferred imaging modality if available. Patients with trigeminal sensory loss, bilateral symptoms, and those younger than 40 years may have a higher risk of secondary TN (ie, painful trigeminal neuropathy).</p><p>In a 2014 meta-analysis of nine blinded case-control studies, the following observations were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurovascular contact of the trigeminal nerve on <span class=\"nowrap\">MRI/MRA</span> was significantly more frequent with symptomatic nerves compared with asymptomatic nerves (89 versus 36 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

In most cases, secondary TN due to acute herpes zoster, postherpetic neuralgia, and trauma can be distinguished from classic TN by a thorough history and examination. Of note, isolated involvement of the V1 subdivision occurs in &lt;5 percent of patients with TN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], while V1 is most commonly affected by postherpetic neuralgia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postherpetic-neuralgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postherpetic neuralgia&quot;</a>). Neuroimaging, preferably with brain MRI, can discern the presence of demyelination or mass lesion as the cause of painful trigeminal neuropathy</p><p>Classic TN or secondary TN can sometimes be confused with dental causes of pain. Dental pain is usually continuous, intraoral pain that is dull or throbbing, whereas classic TN is typically intermittent pain and sharp. However, classic TN is often triggered by oral manipulations such as chewing and brushing the teeth, which can suggest a dental cause and lead patients to present for dental care prior to seeking a medical evaluation. Furthermore, some patients have a phase of &quot;pretrigeminal neuralgia&quot; characterized by atypical symptoms (eg, jaw or tooth pain) that might mimic dental pain. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p>Several uncommon causes of headache and craniofacial pain, including short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks, cluster-tic syndrome, and primary stabbing headache, should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of TN.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with autonomic symptoms (SUNA) are characterized by sudden brief attacks of severe unilateral head pain in orbital, peri-orbital, or temporal regions, accompanied by ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. Attacks may be triggered by a number of factors, including skin contact. Given the short, stabbing nature of the attacks, the cutaneous triggering, and the association of cranial autonomic symptoms with pain in the trigeminal V1 distribution, the differentiation between SUNCT, SUNA, and TN can be difficult. Some argue that the degree of cranial autonomic features in SUNCT and SUNA is greater than in TN, while others suggest that SUNCT, SUNA, and TN are related conditions that exist on a continuum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigeminal-neuralgia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Classic TN encompasses both idiopathic TN cases and those related to vascular compression. Painful trigeminal neuropathy is defined by head <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> facial pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve caused by another disorder and indicative of neural damage. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TN is defined clinically by sudden, usually unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing or lancinating, recurrent episodes of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial (trigeminal) nerve. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of TN is based upon the characteristic clinical features. Sensory loss, bilateral involvement, and younger age are associated with a higher risk of secondary TN (painful trigeminal neuropathy). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with suspected TN, we recommend neuroimaging to help distinguish classic TN from secondary TN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101663\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101663 \">algorithm 1</a>). MRI is the preferred imaging method because of its higher resolution compared with CT. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of classic TN includes conditions that cause secondary TN (also known as painful trigeminal neuropathy), such as demyelination from multiple sclerosis involving the root entry zone or nucleus of the trigeminal nerve and injury of the trigeminal nerve by a nonvascular space-occupying lesion (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above). Painful trigeminal neuropathy can be caused by acute herpes zoster, postherpetic neuralgia, and various causes of trigeminal nerve trauma. Several uncommon causes of headache and craniofacial pain should also be considered in the differential, including short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks, cluster-tic syndrome, and primary stabbing headache. In addition, TN can sometimes be confused with dental causes of pain. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic therapy is used for initial treatment of most patients with classic TN. While no medications have been established as effective for the treatment of secondary TN, patients with secondary TN often respond well to the same medications that are employed in classic TN. In addition, treatment of the underlying condition causing secondary TN is recommended, if feasible. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Medical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with classic TN who require pain control, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> as initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Carbamazepine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with classic TN who require pain control who do not respond to or tolerate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxcarbazepine</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Oxcarbazepine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with classic TN who are refractory to or intolerant of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxcarbazepine</a>, we suggest switching to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a> can be used as add-on therapy. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Baclofen'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Lamotrigine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with classic TN who are refractory to the first and second-line agents listed above, a number of other medications with limited evidence of benefit may be considered. The choice among these agents is driven by patient preference, side effect profile, cost, and physician familiarity. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Other medications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Refractory pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, it is reasonable to discuss options for surgical therapy using microvascular decompression, various types of rhizotomy, or gamma knife radiosurgery. The decision to have surgery and the choice among surgical options will be influenced by individual circumstances including patient preference, adverse effect profile of the available techniques, and expertise of the local center.
