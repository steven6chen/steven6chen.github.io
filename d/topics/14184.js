Nephrogenic rests normally occur in 1 percent of newborn kidneys and regress early in childhood. In contrast, they are present in 35 percent of kidneys with unilateral Wilms tumor and almost 100 percent of kidneys with bilateral disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wilms tumor has been associated with loss of function mutations of a number of tumor suppressor and transcription genes.

The role of these gene mutations in the pathogenesis of Wilms tumor remains unknown.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>WT1 gene &ndash; The WT1 gene is located on chromosome 11p13. The WT1 gene product is expressed in the developing kidney, testis, and ovary. It appears to play a role in the development and differentiation of genitourinary tissues. Mutations of the WT1 gene was the first identified genetic abnormality in children with Wilms tumor and was discovered in karyotypic analysis of children with WAGR syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The 11p13 deletion in WAGR syndrome encompasses several contiguous genes, including the WT1 and PAX 6 (associated with aniridia) genes. In contrast, patients with Denys-Drash syndrome have a point mutation in the eighth or ninth exon of the WT1 gene resulting in their clinical findings. Less than 10 percent of patients with sporadic Wilms tumor have a WT1 gene mutation, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Imprinted genes are those that demonstrate selective gene expression based upon parental origin, such that either the paternal or maternal-inherited gene copy is expressed, but not both. As an example, in patients with BWS, the maternal copy of the Beckwith-Wiedemann (BW) gene is silenced during gametogenesis and only the paternal copy is expressed. As a result, offspring with BWS receive a mutation passed from their father and those who inherit a BW gene mutation from their mother are asymptomatic carriers, who can pass the mutation to their offspring. Patients with BWS and 11p15 gene mutations are at increased risk for Wilms tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/11,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29</a>].

It encodes a nuclear protein, which acts as a transcription factor and blocks the progression of the cell cycle late in the G1 phase. P53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer and is associated with a variety of malignancies including colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma. The p53 gene mutation is seen infrequently in patients with favorable histology tumors, but it is seen in approximately 75 percent of Wilms tumor with anaplastic histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Vigorous palpation may rupture the renal capsule, resulting in tumor spillage, which increases the tumor stage and the need for more intensive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-wilms-tumor#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of Wilms tumor&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>As noted above, Wilms tumor may be associated with congenital anomalies and syndromes. Thus, the examination should include assessment for associated anomalies, such as aniridia, hemihypertrophy, and genitourinary anomalies.

The first goal of imaging is to establish the presence of a renal tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Imaging studies also guide management decisions prior to confirmation of a histologic diagnosis, such as surgical approach and the need for preoperative chemotherapy. Important information includes confirming the presence and function of the contralateral kidney, determining whether there is also tumor in the contralateral kidney, the size and extent of the tumor, and the presence of lung metastases. (See <a href=\"#H2528436941\" class=\"local\">'Chest imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>Abdominal ultrasonography is typically the initial study performed for evaluation of abdominal mass (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of the child with suspected cancer&quot;, section on 'Abdominal masses'</a>). Ultrasonography detects hydronephrosis and multicystic kidney disease, which may present as abdominal masses or swelling. In patients with a suspected renal tumor, Doppler ultrasonography can be performed to detect tumor infiltration of the renal vein and inferior vena cava, and to assess patency of blood flow. This information can also be clarified with computed tomography (CT).</p><p>Contrast-enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended to further evaluate the nature and extent of the mass. CT or MRI also may detect small lesions of tumor or nephrogenic rests in the opposite kidney, which were not detected by ultrasonography. The Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group (COG) evaluated the diagnostic performance of CT and MRI for local staging of pediatric renal tumors and found that they have similar ability to detect lymph node metastasis and capsular penetration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. MRI detected more contralateral synchronous lesions; however, these were rare. The investigators concluded either modality can be used for initial locoregional staging of pediatric renal tumors based on institutional expertise, need for anesthesia, risks of radiation exposure, and cost concerns. At our institution, we typically use CT at the time of initial diagnosis; MRI or CT may be used for follow up imaging depending on the patient&rsquo;s specific circumstances. </p><p>In a separate study, COG investigated the role of preoperative CT scans in detecting tumor rupture and found that ascites beyond the cul-de-sac was the best indicator of rupture; however, the sensitivity of CT to detect tumor rupture was poor (54 to 70 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Preoperative imaging helps the surgeon determine whether the tumor is operable at diagnosis. Patients with any of the following findings or circumstances generally undergo an upfront biopsy and receive prenephrectomy chemotherapy rather than initial primary nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor thrombus above the level of the hepatic veins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary compromise from massive tumor or extensive pulmonary metastases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resection requiring removal of contiguous structures (other than adrenal gland)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgeon judges that attempting nephrectomy would result in significant morbidity, tumor spill, or residual tumor</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2528436941\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging of the chest is needed to determine whether there are lung metastases.

A patient with normal chest radiographs is considered to be free of metastatic lung disease. CT is performed in cases of suspicious or positive chest radiography.
