Community surveys in 14 countries have estimated that the lifetime prevalence of unipolar depressive disorders is 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adult-primary-care-patients-and-general-medical-illness-evidence-for-the-efficacy-of-initial-treatments/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In patients with general medical illnesses such as diabetes or coronary heart disease, the prevalence of major depression is estimated at 10 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adult-primary-care-patients-and-general-medical-illness-evidence-for-the-efficacy-of-initial-treatments/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In addition, disability due to depression is common.
