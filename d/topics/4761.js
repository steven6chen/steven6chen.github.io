A discussion of the pulmonary manifestations of CF is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations of pulmonary disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The underlying pathophysiology of CF is related to abnormal chloride and bicarbonate transport caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) located on chromosome 7. The mutations cause the production of abnormally tenacious mucus and secretions in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and hepatobiliary system. As a result, the lumens of these organs become obstructed leading to the clinical findings associated with this disease process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gastrointestinal complications have become an increasingly important cause of morbidity in patients with CF, in part because of improved life expectancy. Some of the complications, such as gastroesophageal reflux and constipation, are not unique to the CF population, but they are more common and warrant special considerations in diagnosis and management in the CF population. This topic review provides an overview of the gastrointestinal manifestations of CF. Pancreatic insufficiency, which is one of the most clinically important gastrointestinal issues, and other nutritional issues are addressed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Assessment and management of pancreatic insufficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Nutritional issues&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40613046\"><span class=\"h1\">GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) appears to be more common in individuals with CF as compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Symptomatic GERD is reported in 30 to 40 percent of individuals with CF, and &quot;silent&quot; GERD detected by esophageal monitoring has been reported in up to 90 percent of individuals with severe pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the magnitude of the association has not been well-defined, since GERD is common in otherwise healthy individuals and because CF is associated with other gastrointestinal disorders that may contribute to or be confused with GERD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98771\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98771 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The principal mechanism causing GERD in children with CF appears to be transient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which is also the most common mechanism leading to GERD in patients without CF. Several other mechanisms may also contribute to GERD in individuals with CF:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased intra-abdominal pressure due to chronic coughing, wheezing, and lung hyperinflation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased basal tone of the LES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gastric hyperacidity and impaired clearance of acid from the esophagus by saliva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Delayed gastric emptying, due to high-fat diet <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neuropathy caused by CF-related diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Supine positioning during chest physiotherapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Effect of GERD on pulmonary disease</strong> &ndash; GERD is hypothesized to contribute to lung disease in CF because of microaspiration, reflex bronchospasm, or enhanced airway inflammation. This hypothesis is based on an observed association between GERD and pulmonary disease in multiple studies. However, there is no convincing evidence that the association is causal or that treatment for GERD has any beneficial effect on pulmonary function. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The association between GERD and pulmonary disease is supported by multiple observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], including a report of more than 7000 CF patients in a European registry, in which GERD was associated with slightly worse pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The possibility of a causal association is supported by a small randomized study in infants, in which those treated with modified chest physiotherapy (without head-down tilt) to minimize GERD experienced fewer exacerbations and slower decline in pulmonary function over five years, as compared with infants treated with standard chest physiotherapy (with head-down tilt) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The relative benefits and risks of acid-suppressing therapy on pulmonary disease in CF remain unclear. No adequately powered randomized trials have been conducted, and evidence is limited and contradictory. On the one hand, a few small observational studies describe improvement in pulmonary function after treatment for GERD. As an example, in a retrospective study of 218 pediatric patients with CF, those treated with acid-suppressing drugs experienced a smaller decline in pulmonary function and delayed acquisition of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, as compared with those who were not treated with acid-suppressing drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. On the other hand, studies in populations without CF suggest that use of acid-suppressing medications may confer a slightly increased risk for pulmonary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>] (although one large meta-analysis that adjusted for confounders did not support this conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]). Similarly, reports vary in their conclusions about the effects of surgical treatment for GERD on pulmonary disease in CF patients; in some cases, the observed benefits of surgery may be due to the implementation of gastrostomy feeds rather than to treatment of GERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</strong> &ndash; The clinical manifestations and methods to diagnose GERD in individuals with CF are the same as those for individuals without CF. Symptoms typically include chronic heartburn, acid brash, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> regurgitation. The diagnosis is generally made based on clinical symptoms and symptomatic response to acid-suppressing medications. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Esophageal monitoring (pH probe, multichannel intraluminal impedance testing [MII] or catheter-free methods) may be useful to support the diagnosis of GERD in selected cases, but has limited value in excluding other causes of the symptoms or predicting treatment outcomes. Impedance probes may be useful to evaluate nonacid reflux. For CF patients who are treated with acid-suppressing medications in order to optimize the effect of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) but continue to have pulmonary symptoms that do not respond to standard pulmonary treatments, an esophageal pH monitoring study may be useful to evaluate the efficacy of acid suppression. Either type of probe may be difficult to use in patients with CF because of nasal polyps and sinusitis issues; the probe also may exacerbate cough or become displaced as a result of cough. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Contrast radiography (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow) is not useful for the diagnosis of GERD due to low specificity and sensitivity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> &ndash; In patients with CF, it is also important to consider other causes of gastrointestinal dysfunction that may contribute to or mimic GERD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98771\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98771 \">table 1</a>). These include gastrointestinal dysmotility or gastroparesis. Small bowel transit appears to be delayed in patients with CF, and dysmotility may contribute to GERD or mimic its symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In addition, CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is common among adolescents and adults with CF, and can cause gastroparesis, which promotes gastroesophageal reflux. CFRD also is associated with symptoms that might be attributed to GERD, including weight loss and worsening pulmonary function. Rarely, constipation has been reported as an unrecognized cause of GERD in patients without CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H40614386\" class=\"local\">'Constipation'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with intractable symptoms or if surgical intervention is contemplated, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) should be performed to evaluate for other potential causes of GERD-like symptoms, including eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). One case series showed that EoE is underreported in CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management</strong> &ndash; The principles of management of GERD in children with CF are similar to those in otherwise healthy children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A few management issues are specific to individuals with CF, as outlined below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inhibition of gastric acid secretion using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is an appropriate treatment strategy for patients with CF and GERD. However, the goal of therapy with PPI must be considered prior to initiating this therapy. Acid suppression has been used in CF in attempts to treat <span class=\"nowrap\">heartburn/peptic</span> symptoms of reflux, improve pulmonary function, and to normalize the pH of the intestine to improve PERT efficacy, as outlined below. As there is increasing evidence for significant side effects associated with long-term PPI use, the specific goals of PPI therapy must be considered, and reassessment of the efficacy of PPI therapy must be done regularly to determine if the PPI should be continued or weaned off. Several clinical considerations are relevant to this decision: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Unclear effects on pulmonary disease &ndash; It is unclear whether acid suppression has beneficial or adverse effects on pulmonary function in CF patients with GERD, as detailed above. Although GERD is hypothesized to contribute to lung disease in CF, PPIs may be associated with a slightly increased risk for pulmonary infections in populations without CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. As an example, a small randomized study evaluated the effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a> on pulmonary symptoms in 17 adults with CF who had no GERD symptoms, although about two-third had reflux based on esophageal pH monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Among patients randomized to esomeprazole, five of nine experienced pulmonary exacerbations, compared with two of eight subjects given placebo. This small study suggests that patients whose GERD is treated with PPIs should be followed to assure that the treatment does not increase the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Negative effects on bone health &ndash; There are theoretical concerns that chronic use of PPIs may have adverse effects on bone health, and this is of particular concern because CF patients are already at increased risk for osteoporosis. These concerns are based on a possible association between PPI use and risk of fractures in older adults without CF, but the evidence is conflicting and these patients have many reasons for increased fracture risk (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders#H59976497\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proton pump inhibitors: Overview of use and adverse effects in the treatment of acid related disorders&quot;, section on 'Calcium and fracture risk'</a>). Important measures to prevent and monitor for bone disease in patients with CF are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Nutritional issues&quot;, section on 'Bone disease'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Benefits for fat absorption &ndash; Acid suppression can improve fat absorption in some patients with pancreatic insufficiency who have fat malabsorption despite adequate doses of PERT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Assessment and management of pancreatic insufficiency&quot;, section on 'Dosing considerations'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Chronic treatment and monitoring &ndash; If there is no improvement in GERD symptoms during a treatment trial, the PPI can be discontinued. Many patients with CF are on acid suppression to enhance the effect of PERT. If PPIs are used, the patient should be monitored for response and for potential adverse effects, including increased pulmonary exacerbations, vitamin B12 deficiency, and bone heath. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Proton pump inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dietary changes have a limited role in managing GERD in patients with CF. Although a high-fat diet may contribute to GERD by delaying gastric emptying, the benefits of increased caloric density outweigh the potential contribution to GERD. Moreover, whereas dietary management of GERD in patients without CF emphasizes weight loss, this is not a treatment strategy for patients with CF. Some patients may benefit from limiting caffeinated or carbonated beverages or foods that contribute to reflux such as citrus fruits, tomato-based sauces, spicy food, or other foods that exacerbate symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chest physiotherapy should be performed prior to meals, since physiotherapy on a full stomach promotes the development of reflux. The head-down position should not be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgical management of GERD can be considered in patients with complications of GERD including erosive esophagitis, esophageal strictures, failure to thrive, or uncontrolled respiratory disease that appears to be related to GERD and is refractory to medical management. However, the outcomes of antireflux surgery for this patient population are not well-studied, and a few reports suggest poor outcomes. As an example, in a report of children with CF and GERD, nearly half of the children had ongoing symptoms of GERD after antireflux surgery (fundoplication), and there was little improvement in pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, 12 percent had complications that required a subsequent surgical procedure. Some patients may have dysphagia postoperatively and this could contribute to poor nutritional status. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Before considering surgical intervention for GERD, other causes of the symptoms should be carefully excluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98771\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98771 \">table 1</a>). In particular, the patient should be evaluated for CFRD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastroparesis (with an oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT] and gastric emptying study, respectively), as well as other causes of esophageal symptoms (with an upper endoscopy), as discussed in the differential diagnosis section above. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If antireflux surgery is undertaken, optimal pulmonary status should be achieved prior to surgery. The exception to this is the patient with CF who has had lung transplantation. Because reflux injury to the lung can present as bronchiolitis obliterans, early surgical management of GERD can be considered in the postoperative lung transplant patient, and particularly if there is unexplained graft dysfunction or rejection unresponsive to standard therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/3,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Barrett's esophagus has been reported in patients with CF and is a risk factor for esophageal cancer. Although not a common occurrence, the standardized incidence ratio of esophageal cancer in patients with CF is 2.8 relative to the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It is unclear whether the risk of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer is sufficiently high in patients with CF and GERD to warrant routine EGD should be done for surveillance.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11986089\"><span class=\"h2\">Meconium ileus (MI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meconium ileus (MI) is a disorder of the neonate caused by the obstruction of the small intestines at the level of the terminal ileum with inspissated meconium. The widespread use of prenatal carrier testing and prenatal detection of MI by ultrasound enables clinicians to counsel patients and plan proactive management of this complication of CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Approximately 10 percent of patients with CF present as neonates with MI; in most cases these patients have CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) mutations associated with inadequate CFTR production or folding (&quot;severe&quot; genotypes). Conversely, most series suggest that 80 to 90 percent of infants with MI have CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], although a few series report higher proportions of non-CF MI, particularly in low birthweight infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Presentation and diagnosis</strong> &ndash; Infants with MI generally present during the first three days of life with abdominal distension and failure to pass meconium, with or without vomiting. Affected infants are initially stabilized with nasogastric decompression and correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. An abdominal plain film should be performed to look for evidence of dilated bowel loops, perforation, calcifications, or other abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100556\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100556 \">image 1</a>). If there is no evidence of perforation, hyperosmotic contrast enema radiography is performed to confirm the diagnosis, using a water-soluble agent. In patients with MI, the contrast radiograph typically reveals a small-caliber colon (microcolon of disuse) and meconium pellets in the terminal ileum. The ileum proximal to the obstruction is dilated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100557\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100557 \">image 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">MI is divided into two categories, which informs management and prognosis: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MI is &quot;complex&quot; if it is complicated by gastrointestinal pathology, including intestinal perforation, meconium peritonitis, atresia, or volvulus. Prenatal perforation may cause meconium peritonitis, which can cause calcifications visible on abdominal radiography. Approximately 40 percent of MI in newborns with CF is complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MI is &quot;simple&quot; if there is no associated gastrointestinal pathology. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disease associations</strong> &ndash; All infants with MI should have a definitive diagnostic test for CF. A sweat test may be obtained after 48 hours of age, although it is difficult to collect sweat in an infant under approximately 2.5 kg, or infants who are stressed or in a warmer bed. If an adequate quantity of sweat cannot be obtained, mutation analysis may be helpful. Infants with MI are likely to have a negative newborn screen for CF, for unclear reasons. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H59100333\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Infants with MI are at increased risk for developing cholestasis, but the cholestasis is transient in most cases and does not appear to predict clinically significant hepatobiliary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] (see <a href=\"#H40620891\" class=\"local\">'Cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD)'</a> below). One analysis suggests that patients who present with MI have higher rates and shorter times to obstructive lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, others have shown long-term outcomes for infants with MI are similar to those without MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonoperative management &ndash; If simple MI is confirmed by the diagnostic enema, it is usually managed by administration of hyperosmolar enema (typically diluted sodium meglumine diatrizoate, Gastrografin), closely monitored by fluoroscopy. The hyperosmolar contrast often breaks up the meconium mass and clears the obstruction. This approach is successful in 20 to 40 percent of neonates with simple MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Complications occur in 2 to 10 percent of these procedures and include intestinal perforation and fluid shifts with hypotension and shock. Patients should be well hydrated and have an intravenous line in place before performing the procedure. Historical series reported higher success rates (60 to 80 percent), but with higher complication rates as compared with more recent series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The higher rates of success and complications in historical series may both depend on use of higher instillation pressures and multiple attempts, and the experience of the radiologist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Operative management &ndash; Surgical approaches are used for complicated MI and for some cases of simple MI that do not clear with nonoperative intervention. Operative procedures include simple enterotomy with lavage, double enterostomy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resection of dilated, perforated, or atretic bowel, with diversion ileostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/33,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36</a>]. The most conservative operation that relieves the obstruction should be performed. Loss of intestine in a patient with CF may have deleterious consequences to future nutrition, out of proportion to what is seen in children without CF. A pediatric surgeon with experience in CF is optimal. Patients with CF and ileostomies are at increased risk of sodium loss, and careful attention should be paid to sodium requirements and replacement.

DIOS is unique to CF. DIOS must be distinguished from constipation, which is characterized by gradual onset of fecal impaction of the colon, starting at the sigmoid and extending proximally. DIOS can occur at any age, but it is more common in those with pancreatic insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> &ndash; DIOS occurs in 10 to 47 percent of CF patients, depending upon the criteria used to make the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>].

DIOS may be recurrent and is associated with more severe genotypes, but also appears to be influenced by nongenetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The development of DIOS is not associated with pulmonary exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Risk factors for developing DIOS include severe genotype (eg, F508del), pancreatic insufficiency, poorly controlled fat malabsorption, dehydration, and prior episodes of DIOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. DIOS also is more common in patients who use opioids or have undergone organ transplantation.

The pathogenesis of DIOS is not fully understood, but several mechanisms have been suggested:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Insufficient pancreatic enzyme activity &ndash; About 90 percent of patients with DIOS have pancreatic insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/37,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,46</a>].

The proposed mechanism is that malabsorbed fat may slow intestinal transit and alter the viscosity of the luminal contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/38,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dysmotility &ndash; Intestinal dysmotility, either intrinsic or iatrogenic, has also been suggested as a factor in the development of this disorder. This factor might also explain the high rate of recurrence in some patients. The presence of constipation in 42 percent of individuals with DIOS also supports this reasoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

This has been demonstrated in CF mouse models, in which ileal mucus is denser, more adherent, and less penetrable as compared with wild-type mice. These properties can be normalized by admixture with a high-concentrated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> buffer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>While acute episodes of dehydration and changes in diet have been associated with the development of DIOS, a common set of precipitating factors has not been identified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical manifestations</strong> &ndash; The most common manifestation of DIOS is cramping abdominal pain, generally located in the right lower quadrant. The onset of symptoms can be acute or intermittent, and the symptoms tend to become progressively severe over time. Other features include abdominal distension, flatulence, weight loss, and poor appetite. Vomiting may ensue when complete obstruction develops. Patients usually are constipated but also may have diarrhea or even a normal stool pattern. On examination, a mass may be palpated in the right lower quadrant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> &ndash; DIOS can be diagnosed in patients with CF who present with the classical triad of:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abdominal pain and distension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A right lower quadrant mass</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Plain abdominal radiographs showing accumulation of stool in the distal small intestine and right colon. The stool is usually described as &quot;bubbly&quot; or granular in appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100465\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100465 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Other characteristic findings on plain film include air-fluid levels and small bowel dilatation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">DIOS is a condition unique to CF and is largely unknown to primary care physicians, emergency room physicians, and gastroenterologists with limited experience with CF. For this reason, it is important to educate patients and their families about the possibility and symptoms of DIOS, and recommend that they contact the CF caregiver if they develop symptoms concerning for DIOS and are receiving care outside the CF Center.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other forms of imaging also can aid in the diagnosis. An abdominal ultrasound can identify an obstructing mass but cannot always rule out appendicitis or intussusception, as discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. On computerized tomography (CT) scan, findings characteristic of DIOS include proximal small-bowel dilation and inspissated fecal material in the distal ileum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100558\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100558 \">image 4</a>); the scan also helps to exclude other causes of the symptoms. Alternatively, a water-soluble contrast enema can be useful for diagnosis; the absence of contrast material in the terminal ileum is suggestive of DIOS. Such enemas are hyperosmolar and can be therapeutic as well as diagnostic; the technique and risks are discussed below. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> &ndash; DIOS should be distinguished from chronic constipation, in which the onset of symptoms is more gradual and the stool mass is more distal or distributed evenly throughout the colon, although the two conditions often co-occur. Intussusception is a particularly important consideration, especially for patients with vomiting or other signs of complete obstruction. Patients who have had previous abdominal surgery are at risk for bowel obstruction secondary to adhesions. Other causes of symptoms that can mimic DIOS include appendicitis, volvulus, ovarian disease, Crohn disease, and fibrosing colonopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Some authors suggest that the prevalence of Crohn disease is increased in individuals with CF, and ileocecal Crohn disease may mimic DIOS (see <a href=\"#H15041867\" class=\"local\">'Associations with other gastrointestinal diseases'</a> below). Fibrosing colonopathy has become much less common but is also in the differential diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H15041327\" class=\"local\">'Fibrosing colonopathy'</a> below). The incidence of gastrointestinal cancers is increasing and although rare, should be considered in patients with recurrent symptoms or episodes of bowel obstruction that do not resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. If the diagnosis of DIOS is unclear, other diagnostic studies should be performed to evaluate for these disorders, based upon the patient's clinical findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98771\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98771 \">table 1</a>). In addition to imaging, laboratory testing to exclude other causes of abdominal pain may include a complete blood count (CBC), liver enzymes, urinalysis and culture, and serum amylase and lipase. Of note, pancreatitis is common among CF patients with pancreatic sufficiency, but is rare among those with pancreatic insufficiency (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatitis'</a> below).

Those with complete DIOS should be treated from below with hyperosmolar contrast enemas. Patients with signs of peritonitis may require surgery and should be urgently evaluated by a surgeon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Initial management for both surgical and nonsurgical cases should be aimed at correcting any fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. A nasogastric tube should be considered for decompression, especially in patients who are vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Subsequently, treatment should be aimed at removal of the inspissated plug. This can be accomplished using a combination of enemas and laxatives. Treatment is generally tailored to the severity of the episode. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who are not vomiting, each of the following approaches has been used successfully in patients with DIOS severe enough to warrant hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A balanced electrolyte intestinal lavage solution (such as GoLYTELY), is administered either orally or nasogastrically (particularly in children) at a rate of 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour (maximum 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/hour)</span> over eight hours. Children generally require a total of 2 to 3 liters and adults 5 to 6 liters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diatrizoate-meglumine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diatrizoate meglumine</a> and diatrizoate sodium (Gastrografin) can be administered orally or by nasogastric tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. For children younger than six years, an appropriate dose is 50 mL of Gastrografin in 200 mL of water or juice. For older patients, 100 mL of Gastrografin is diluted in 400 mL of water or juice. In each age group, half of this dose is given on subsequent days if needed to complete the clean-out. In the past, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) was used orally in a similar fashion, but there is better clinical evidence supporting the use of Gastrografin for DIOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients presenting with bilious vomiting or other evidence of complete intestinal obstruction, or for those who do not respond to the above measures, a hyperosmolar enema (sodium meglumine diatrizoate, Gastrografin) can be used; this is both diagnostic and therapeutic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. The enema consists of 100 mL of Gastrografin, diluted in 400 mL water; it is administered under fluoroscopic guidance to visually confirm clearance of the obstruction as the enema refluxes retrograde through the ileocecal junction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100559\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100559 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Tween-80 (polysorbate 80, a soap- or solvent-like compound) may be added to the Gastrografin. The amount of <span class=\"nowrap\">Tween-80/Gastrografin</span> varies from patient to patient, and some patients may require more than one enema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, if the obstruction fails to resolve, other causes should always be considered, as discussed in the differential diagnosis section above. Risks associated with hyperosmolar enemas include perforation, bowel ischemia, and depletion of intravascular fluid with hypotension and shock, or bowel perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. As a result, this procedure should be performed only by a radiologist experience in the technique. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mineral oil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a> enemas usually are not effective for the distal ileal obstruction found in DIOS. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A few patients do not respond to the medical management described above, or develop evidence of intestinal ischemia. In this case, surgical laparotomy and decompression is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], and other causes of bowel obstruction should be considered. The most conservative operation that relieves the obstruction should be performed to preserve as much intestine as possible; surgeons with experience in CF are preferred. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Once the inspissated plug has been eliminated, treatment aimed at preventing further episodes should be instituted, since DIOS recurs frequently. One approach that is usually well-tolerated is chronic administration of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyethylene-glycol-3350-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polyethylene glycol 3350</a> (PEG without electrolytes), at a dose of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">gram/kg/day</span> (maximum 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day)</span> for 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The clinician should also optimize pancreatic enzyme treatment and adherence to the regimen, encourage adequate hydration, and consider other potential contributors, such as constipation and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

As a result, a maximum dose of 2500 lipase <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/meal</span> (or 10,000 lipase <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/day)</span> was recommended. However, the exact cause of the strictures remains unclear.

Reports of enzyme-associated colonopathy have been rare since attention has been paid to not prescribing excessive doses of PERT. In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required that all PERT products comply with modern chemistry, manufacturing, and control criteria, including predictable amounts of enzyme content. As part of that approval process, a large Phase IV study is underway to determine whether the current products are linked to fibrosing colonopathy (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01652157&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPMprHQcgVHPXC9+LCEfP66RdYMcKTlhFse51fYYynnjXg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5858\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT01652157</a>).

Clinical symptoms of SIBO may be nonspecific and include bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, dyspepsia, and weight loss or failure to gain weight. This condition was first recognized in patients following gastrointestinal surgery but now is described in other clinical settings, including in patients with malnutrition or disorders affecting gastrointestinal motility.

These observations have prompted investigation into whether intestinal inflammation might contribute to gastrointestinal pathology in CF. </p><p>Several lines of evidence lend support to this hypothesis. One study showed that gastrointestinal symptoms are associated with polymorphisms in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a proinflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages and known to be involved with the pulmonary inflammatory cascade in CF lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Another study showed that immune activation occurs in the gut of patients with CF and that this may result from the underlying basic cellular defect in CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. A third study found that adults with CF had varying degrees of inflammatory findings including edema, mucosal breaks, and ulcerations, as seen on wireless capsule endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Finally, fecal calprotectin, a protein released during neutrophil activation and a marker of intestinal inflammation, is elevated in patients with CF compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. However, <em>in vitro</em> studies suggest that trypsin can digest calprotectin; this presents a challenge when interpreting elevated calprotectin levels in individuals with pancreatic insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. </p><p>Patients with CF have an intestinal microbiome that differs from individuals without CF and this may correlate with fecal measures of nutrient malabsorption and markers of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/94-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-96</a>]. Thus, there is interest in whether manipulating the intestinal microbiome through the use of probiotics could have a beneficial effect on intestinal inflammation. Several randomized trials have investigated this approach, with some positive results but methodological flaws [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. As an example, in a Turkish study of 47 patients with CF, two-thirds had elevated fecal calprotectin levels at baseline, indicating intestinal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. The patients were then randomized to receive probiotics or placebo, and those treated with probiotics had lower fecal calprotectin levels after four weeks. Another randomized study showed that treatment of CF patients with the probiotic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactobacillus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lactobacillus</a> reuteri improved gastrointestinal discomfort and decreased fecal calprotectin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

In patients with CF and in the general population, serologic testing for tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies is typically used to screen for celiac disease, but intestinal biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. Occasionally, tTG is elevated in patients without histological evidence of celiac disease on biopsy, in patients with or without CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. It remains unclear whether patients with CF are at increased risk for celiac disease as compared with the general population. One Scandinavian study reported that the prevalence of celiac disease was three times higher among patients with CF as compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>], but this finding has not been reported in other populations.

One retrospective review reported that patients with CF had a higher prevalence of IBD, and particularly of Crohn disease, compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

In those with severe mutations, flow is so diminished that abnormally tenacious mucus and secretions obstruct the pancreatic lumen. This blockage interferes with secretion of pancreatic enzymes, causing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It also leads to autolysis and progressive destruction of pancreatic islets; a large percentage of these patients eventually develop abnormal glucose tolerance and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). Patients with milder mutations also have decreased flow but usually have enough duct patency to allow enzymes to pass; clinically these patients are pancreatic sufficient. However, patients with pancreatic sufficiency may have intermittent blockages and inflammation of the pancreas, causing pancreatitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic insufficiency is the most common gastrointestinal complication of CF.

The major consequences of pancreatic insufficiency are due to fat malabsorption secondary to decreased production of pancreatic enzymes. As a result, patients with undiagnosed or under-treated pancreatic disease are at risk for steatorrhea, malnutrition, and deficiencies of the fat-soluble vitamins A, E, D, and K. However, clinically apparent vitamin deficiency is uncommon because individuals with CF are routinely supplemented with these vitamins. </p><p>The diagnosis and management of pancreatic insufficiency in this population, including strategies for pancreatic enzyme replacement and fibrosing colonopathy, are discussed separately.

In some such patients, defective ductular and acinar pancreatic secretion leads to recurrent or chronic pancreatitis, which in turn causes a decline of pancreatic exocrine function. Among patients with pancreatic sufficiency at the time of the first episode of pancreatitis, about 20 percent subsequently experience a decline of pancreatic function and become pancreatic insufficient.

DIOS is characterized by progressive cramping abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), often with an RLQ mass, and sometimes progressing to vomiting. The differential diagnosis includes constipation, ileocecal Crohn disease, appendicitis, intussusception, fibrosing colonopathy, and gastrointestinal cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98771\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98771 \">table 1</a>). Management focuses on correcting fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, if present, and removing the inspissated plug using osmotic agents. Surgery rarely is needed. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intussusception</strong> occurs in approximately 1 percent of patients with CF and usually is caused by inspissated bowel contents that serve as the lead point. Clinically, it is characterized by colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and a palpable mass. The presenting symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those of complete DIOS. The diagnosis can be made with ultrasound or with a contrast enema, which may also be therapeutic. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Intussusception'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)</strong> occurs in individuals with CF because of several contributing factors. Clinical symptoms are nonspecific and include bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, dyspepsia, and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Because of limitations of hydrogen and methane breath testing, diagnosis is usually based on clinical history and an empiric trial of antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rectal prolapse</strong> now occurs in approximately 3 percent of children with CF. In the past, it was much more common, occurring in up to 20 percent of individuals with classic CF, presumably because of later diagnosis in the absence of newborn screening programs, and possibly suboptimal treatment with pancreatic enzyme therapy. It may be associated with constipation, diarrhea, malnutrition, and insufficient PERT dosing. Rectal prolapse should be manually reduced and patients treated with daily osmotic laxatives; surgery is rarely necessary. (See <a href=\"#H15041729\" class=\"local\">'Rectal prolapse'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5203268\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic disease</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pancreatic insufficiency</strong> affects approximately 85 percent of patients with CF and may cause fat malabsorption with steatorrhea, growth failure, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. The diagnosis and management of pancreatic insufficiency in this population, including strategies for pancreatic enzyme replacement, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Assessment and management of pancreatic insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pancreatic sufficiency</strong> does not mean that patients with CF have totally normal pancreatic function. Flow through the duct is decreased but not enough to block enzyme secretions. However, these patients still have relatively dehydrated bowels and can develop constipation and intermittent pancreatic ductal blockages. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pancreatitis</strong> develops in about 15 to 20 percent of CF patients with pancreatic sufficiency and is rare among those with pancreatic insufficiency. Among patients with pancreatic sufficiency at the time of the first episode of pancreatitis, about 20 percent subsequently experience a decline of pancreatic function and become pancreatic insufficient. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD)</strong> develops in many CF patients with chronic pancreatic disease, which leads to progressive endocrine pancreatic dysfunction. The risk of developing CFRD increases markedly with advancing age; CFRD affects about 20 percent of adolescents with CF, and almost 50 percent after 30 years of age. Other risk factors include the presence of pancreatic insufficiency, the delta F508 homozygous genotype, and female gender. Annual screening for CFRD is recommended starting at 10 years of age; screening and management are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5203398\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatobiliary disease</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD)</strong> has multiple presentations, including neonatal cholestasis, hepatic steatosis, and focal biliary cirrhosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100004 \">table 3</a>). Among these, focal biliary cirrhosis is most likely to cause progressive liver disease, with associated complications and mortality. Screening and management are discussed in a separate topic review.
