The clinical syndrome (phenotype) is characterized by extremely elevated levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a propensity to early onset atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Homozygotes generally manifest disease in childhood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dyslipidemia-in-children-definition-screening-and-diagnosis#H435128194\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dyslipidemia in children: Definition, screening, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Familial hypercholesterolemia'</a>.)</p><p>There are multiple definitions of FH in the literature.

The FH clinical syndrome or phenotype is defined by clinical criteria,&nbsp;and it is the severity of the syndrome that determines what treatment is offered. Clinical definitions vary slightly according to the purpose for which they are to be used. </p><p>The following three clinical definitions represent the most commonly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dutch Lipid Clinic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F88939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88939 \">table 1</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simon Broome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F111789\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111789 \">table 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>American Heart Association criteria for the clinical diagnosis of FH: low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) &gt;190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&gt;4.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/l)</span> and either a first degree relative with LDL-C&gt;190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or with known premature coronary heart disease (55 years men; &lt;60 years women) 190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>This topic review will attempt to specify which definition is being used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384771452\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Using DNA testing, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) have been identified as generally having a functional mutation of one of three genes: the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (sometimes called the <span class=\"nowrap\">apoB/E</span> receptor), gain-of-function mutations of the proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 gene (<em>PCSK9</em>), and the apolipoprotein B gene (principally <em>APOB3500</em>). Each of these three mutations impairs LDL receptor-mediated catabolism of LDL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>Mutations in these three genes can be detected in about 80 percent of patients with the definite FH clinical syndrome (also called phenotype) and 20 to 30 percent of those with possible FH syndrome. Of those with one of these three mutations, 85 to 90 percent have <em>LDLR </em>mutations, 2 to 4 percent gain-of function <em>PCSK9</em> mutations, and 1 to 12 percent <em>APOB</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. </p><p>The question arises as to what is the cause of the 20 percent or so of definite FH and 70 to 80 percent of possible FH patients, with at least some of the clinical features of FH. Probably the majority of definite and possible FH patients in whom no causative single gene mutations are identifiable have severe forms of polygenic hypercholesterolaemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview/abstract/8,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10-12</a>]. </p><p>It is likely that only a very small proportion have some as of yet undiscovered causative single gene mutation. For example, mutations in a signal transducing adaptor family member 1 (<em>STAP1</em>), occurring in &lt;0.1 percent of cases, have been proposed as candidates to be the fourth cause of FH.&nbsp;</p><p>There will also be some in this category who have a genetic variant of <em>LDLR </em>or <em>APOB</em>, but it is in a region coding for a domain, which is not known to be critical for ligand binding or completion of the LDL receptor cycle. These will be classified as mutations of uncertain significance, and the hypercholesterolemia may really be the result of a coincident polygenic disorder.</p><p>Identifying probands for DNA testing to identify causative mutations as a preamble to cascade family screening may, for example, have more rigorous criteria than might be used to determine the need for treatment. The former may seek to identify only definite FH, whereas the latter may also identify possible FH in whom cardiovascular disease risk may be high even though the likelihood of discovering a single causative mutation may be lower. Furthermore, because it is relatively inexpensive to screen other family members once the mutation in a proband has been identified, cascade screening can then be extended to possible FH. On cascade screening, some relatives may be found who possess the same mutation as the proband, but do not have a clinical syndrome of the same severity as the proband. So the definition of a genetic predisposition and the expression of the clinical syndrome may be different. For example, potentially causative <em>LDLR</em> mutations are highly likely to be associated with the FH syndrome, whereas only a minority of those with <em>apoB3500</em> mutations or PCSK9 gain-of-function mutations will generally express the FH syndrome. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4076522488\"><span class=\"h2\">Homozygotes versus heterozygotes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FH is an autosomal dominant disorder inherited with a gene dosing effect, in which homozygotes are more adversely affected than heterozygotes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F105115\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105115 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Many cases labeled as &quot;homozygous FH&quot; for purposes of clinical management are generally compound heterozygotes (a different mutation on each allele) when parents are unrelated. This occurs because there are a very large number of distinct mutations in the gene encoding the LDL-R so, without consanguinity, it is more likely that someone would inherit two different mutations in the LDLR gene than the same one from unrelated parents. True homozygosity can occur when a consanguinous union occurs between two heterozygotes or rarely when parents are not closely related, but there is a high prevalence of a limited number of LDLR<em> </em>mutations in a community, for example, due to a founder gene effect in a regional population. </p><p>The severity of the clinical &quot;homozygous FH&quot; syndrome depends not on whether homozygosity is true or in reality compound heterozygosity, but on the extent to which the specific mutation a patient harbors interferes with LDL metabolism. Other genetic variations in the genome that cause more minor LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) raising may also affect the LDL-C concentration in FH patients and contribute to enhanced cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>].</p><p>Heterozygous FH patients have high LDL-C levels from birth, a higher risk of premature coronary heart disease, often demonstrate tendon xanthomata if untreated, and frequently have a family history of hypercholesterolemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F88939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88939 \">table 1</a>). In one report, the fractional clearance of LDL-C was reduced by 27 percent in heterozygotes and 53 percent in homozygotes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Some of the excess LDL-C is deposited in the arteries as atheroma and in the tendons and skin as xanthomata (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52572%7EPC%2F50109%7EPC%2F71083%7EPC%2F67239\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52572 graphicRef50109 graphicRef71083 graphicRef67239 \">picture 1A-D</a>) and xanthelasma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67919\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67919 \">picture 2</a>). The prevalence of xanthomata increases with age, eventually occurring in 75 percent of FH heterozygotes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3551017297\"><span class=\"h2\">LDL receptor genetic defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In its most common form, FH is a monogenic disorder caused by defects in the gene that encodes for the apo <span class=\"nowrap\">B/E</span> (LDL) receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview/abstract/6,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14-16</a>]. The associated impairment in function of these receptors results in reduced clearance of LDL particles from the circulation and an elevation in plasma LDL-C. In general, plasma levels of LDL-C are inversely related to the level of residual LDLR activity. There is also increased uptake of modified LDL (oxidized or other modifications) by the macrophage scavenger receptors, resulting in macrophage lipid accumulation and foam cell formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Fewer LDL receptors lead to less clearance of LDL-C and higher serum levels. Gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 are rare, but lead to decreased LDLR expression, decreased LDL catabolism, higher levels of LDL-C, the HeFH clinical syndrome, and increased risk of ischemic heart disease; loss-of-function mutations are more common and are associated with reductions of both LDL-C and risk of ischemic heart disease.</p><p>The following observations summarize the clinical importance of PCSK9:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated levels are associated with reduced expression of the hepatic LDLR and increased serum LDL-C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].
