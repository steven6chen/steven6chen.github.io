Using a hypertension threshold of <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> rather than <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg, hypertension treatment and control were, respectively, about 75 and 70 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82423 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

This problem persists despite the success that various individual programs have had in attaining high adherence rates with both nondrug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and drug regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the major issues related to nonadherence with antihypertensive therapy. A more complete discussion of noncompliance is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adherence to lipid-altering medications and recommended lifestyle changes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">REASON FOR NONADHERENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonadherence to antihypertensive medication is common. As an example, in a study of 149 hypertensive patients who were monitored with electronic pill boxes, 42 percent were nonadherent, defined as taking less than 80 percent of prescribed antihypertensive medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In another study, high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for drug levels was performed on urine and serum specimens from 1348 hypertensive patients in two countries; partial and complete nonadherence ranged, respectively, from 20 to 27 percent and from 12 to 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Adherence was lower among patients who were younger, male, and prescribed more than one antihypertensive medication or prescribed diuretics. Other factors have also been found to reduce adherence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76642\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76642 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Suboptimal adherence is a major barrier to realizing the benefits of evidence-based pharmacologic therapies for many medical conditions. Thus, adherence is an important topic of longstanding interest and remains a key barrier to better patient outcomes. Adherence is a complex phenomenon, and no single intervention has solved this challenge.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five dimensions of adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social and economic factors such as age, race, sex, and socioeconomic and educational status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient-related factors including readiness to change, locus of control and self-efficacy, future discounting, health beliefs, health literacy, lack of knowledge, forgetfulness, and fear of dependence</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy-related factors including the complexity and cost of treatment, especially out-of-pocket costs, and adverse effects</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbid conditions, such as drug <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alcohol abuse, depression, psychosis, impaired mental status, number of chronic medical conditions, and severity of symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health care system factors, such as the patient-provider relationship, provider workload and burnout, misaligned and absent incentives, and absent or limited care coordination and care integration</p><p/><p>The ensuing discussion will focus on those adherence factors that the clinician and care team can impact as they care for patients with hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient and disease characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hypertension have special problems related to the nature of their disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A substantial minority of hypertensive individuals are largely unaware of the definition, possible causes, sequelae, and therapeutic needs of hypertension. A variety of factors may contribute to the lack of awareness, such as the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most hypertensive individuals are asymptomatic, and therefore they frequently have little motivation to seek or follow treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypertension often begins prior to the age of 40 years when many individuals, especially men, receive minimal preventive health care. The prevalence of early onset of hypertension is increasing as the adiposity of the population increases. Not surprisingly, hypertension control is lower at these younger ages, especially in men.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hypertension rarely present only with hypertension. Rather, multiple chronic conditions are often present including hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes, arthritis, depression, and gastroesophageal reflux. In Medicare beneficiaries with hypertension and related complications, the burden of comorbid disease is particularly high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recognition of hypertension often provokes a strong denial reaction. In addition, the diagnosis carries considerable economic and social threat for some individuals (eg, job loss, insurance, and sexual potency), which may further inhibit the patient from accepting the diagnosis and effective treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapy of hypertension raises several adherence challenges, which are often compounded by clinical practices such as the use of complex and costly regimens that can have adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In particular, side effects are common and discourage adherence. Examples include impotence and overt or subtle effects on mood and psychologic functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The latter findings can only be identified by careful testing.</p><p>Although patients are usually faulted for poor compliance, clinicians' communication with their patients is often suboptimal. In addition, clinicians often do not prescribe additional therapy when blood pressures are clearly above the goal of therapy, a phenomenon known as therapeutic inertia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Therapeutic inertia may, in fact, be a larger contributor to uncontrolled hypertension than poor patient adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF ADHERENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most clinicians are confident that they can predict the antihypertensive medication adherence of their patients, their predictions are no more accurate than what can be obtained by the toss of a coin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. No single method is both practical and highly accurate.</p><p>There are several feasible and potentially useful options to assess adherence in the routine clinical setting; examples include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask the patient if he or she misses any doses of antihypertensive medication. Patients who admit to missing doses are typically taking fewer than 80 percent of prescribed doses, although some more adherent patients may also miss an occasional dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The likelihood of nonadherence is even greater if, in addition to missing doses, the medication has resulted in a poor therapeutic response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a simple questionnaire. As an example, one published questionnaire contains just three items: the degree to which the patient feels the medication is important, the degree to which the patient thinks the medication may harm them, and the degree to which the medication is financially burdensome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The individual responses are scored and added, producing a likelihood of adherence problems ranging from greater than 68 percent to less than 25 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F113459\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113459 \">table 3</a>). The Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4) is another commonly used tool to estimate the likelihood of nonadherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask the patient to bring his or her antihypertensive medications to the office visit and calculate the medication possession ratio (MPR), which serves as a proxy for adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This involves reviewing the prescription bottles at an office visit and checking the number of remaining refills relative to when the prescription was first filled. In this way, the clinical staff can estimate days of supply or the MPR as a proxy for adherence. As an example, if a 90-day supply of medication was initially prescribed with three refills (360 days of available medication) and after nine months the medication bottle indicates that there are two refills remaining, then only 180 days of medication were filled over a 270-day period. The MPR is <span class=\"nowrap\">180/270</span> or 0.67. Most patients do not refill prescriptions for medications that they are not taking, especially if filling those prescriptions requires personal effort.</p><p/><p>However, these methods are imperfect and sometimes fail to identify nonadherent patients. As an example, in one study that measured urinary drug metabolites, complete nonadherence was identified in approximately 25 percent of patients who underwent a detailed evaluation for resistant hypertension and who, based upon detailed questionnaires, were believed to be taking all prescribed antihypertensive medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A similar study compared adherence assessed using directly measured drug metabolites with responses to the MMAS-4 questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Scores on the MMAS-4 were similar among adherent and nonadherent patients.</p><p>More sophisticated techniques for assessing adherence include measurements of medications in urine or blood samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], electronic medication monitors, and the use of pills that emit a small electrical signal triggered by gastric acid that are detected by an abdominal sensor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. While the technology for this last technique is at an early stage, the potential for assessing adherence would be even better than with pill bottle memory caps, which simply detect whether the prescription bottle was opened. However, these options are not available for routine clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and may not be feasible in primary care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODS TO IMPROVE ADHERENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines to improve patient adherence are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77847\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77847 \">table 4</a>). A few of these suggestions deserve more emphasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3254922122\"><span class=\"h2\">Educate and communicate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Educate and maintain contact with the patient and the patient's family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Information about medications, when written in simple language and attractively presented, is useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Broken appointments to clinics have been reduced by mail, telephone, and clinician reminders and by establishing a contract with the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Clinicians who provide more information to patients generally achieve better patient satisfaction, recall, and adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Clinicians who interview patients with questions that encourage the patient to reflect on the consequences of their behavior appear to achieve better patient satisfaction, recall, and adherence than those who use more direct or close-ended questions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients who are actively engaged in selecting their treatments are also more likely to adhere than patients for whom the clinician is the sole decision-maker.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4086470476\"><span class=\"h2\">Encourage home blood pressure self-monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some reports have shown that home blood pressure self-monitoring can improve adherence, especially among patients with uncontrolled hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. The impact of self-monitoring on blood pressure control, and presumably adherence, improves if blood pressure data are relayed back to the health care provider and improves further if the health care provider then communicates back to the patient between visits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3302953391\"><span class=\"h2\">Use technology acceptable to the patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various patient-reminder systems exist to improve adherence, ranging in sophistication from pill organizers to daily pill dispensers and text messaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. As an example, in a pooled analysis of 16 randomized trials and more than 2700 hypertensive patients (mean age of 39 years), the use of text messaging reminders nearly doubled the likelihood of medication adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3083855233\"><span class=\"h2\">Keep treatment inexpensive and simple</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An effort should be made to limit both the financial burden and complexity of antihypertensive therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce out-of-pocket costs. Adherence is inversely related to out-of-pocket medication costs. In one study, for example, out-of-pocket costs accounted for 36 percent of the variance in adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Thus, efforts to minimize out-of-pocket costs, especially for relatively asymptomatic conditions such as hypertension, are important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The use of less expensive medications is being emphasized in an attempt to reduce the costs of health care and to ensure that patients have access to needed medications without undue cost barriers. Generic, less expensive options are now available within each class of antihypertensive drugs. Studies of blood pressure-lowering drugs indicate that adherence may be better with generic as compared with proprietary formulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use the smallest effective dose. Minimum effective doses should be prescribed in an attempt to avoid side effects of antihypertensive medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use single-pill combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Keeping therapy simple includes the use of single-pill combinations that contain more than one antihypertensive medication. An increasing number of once-a-day formulations are available so that fewer tablets are needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several studies have shown that patients receiving single-pill antihypertensive combinations are more likely to adhere than patients given the same medications as individual pills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Patients given single-pill combinations also appear to achieve control more rapidly and to attain better control during their first year of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Therapeutic inertia also appears to be lower with single-pill combinations than traditional stepped-care therapy using single-pill medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103774758\"><span class=\"h2\">Consolidate refills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with hypertension have multiple chronic conditions and receive a substantial number of prescription medications.
