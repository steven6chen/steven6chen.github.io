Three distinct clinical forms of BL are recognized: endemic (African), sporadic (non-endemic), and immunodeficiency-associated. Although they are histologically identical and have similar clinical behavior, there are differences in epidemiology, clinical presentation, and genetic features between the three forms as described below.</p><p>BL and Burkitt leukemia are considered different manifestations of the same disease in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematologic malignancies. The revised 2016 WHO classification also proposes three aggressive B cell lymphoma entities that resemble BL: &quot;Burkitt-like lymphoma with 11q aberration&quot;; &quot;High-grade B cell lymphoma with <em>MYC</em> and <em>BCL2</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <em>BCL6</em> rearrangement,&quot; and &quot;High-grade B cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

For epidemiologic and diagnostic purposes, cases of BL are generally divided into three distinct clinical forms: endemic (African), sporadic (non-endemic), and immunodeficiency-associated. The endemic and sporadic clinical variants of BL differ geographically.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endemic &ndash; The endemic variant is found in equatorial Africa and New Guinea. The incidence of BL in Africa is approximately 50-fold higher than that seen in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. BL accounts for 30 to 50 percent of all childhood cancer in equatorial Africa with an estimated incidence of 3 to 6 cases per 100,000 children per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The peak incidence occurs in children age four to seven years, and the male:female ratio is approximately 2:1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sporadic &ndash; The sporadic variant is seen in the United States and Western Europe. BL comprises 30 percent of pediatric lymphomas and &lt;1 percent of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This translates into an estimated incidence of approximately three cases per million persons per year in both children and adults. In Europe, the incidence is approximately 2.2 cases per million persons per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The peak incidence occurs in children age 11 years. Among adults, sporadic BL is typically seen in patients less than 35 years of age, with a median age at diagnosis of 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. Sporadic BL is more common among Caucasians than in African or Asian Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Data suggest that it may be substantially more common in some areas of Central America (eg, Guatemala) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In all groups, the majority of patients are male with a 3 or 4:1 male:female ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/5,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunodeficiency-associated &ndash; The immunodeficiency-associated variant is primarily seen in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and less commonly in patients with other causes of immunodeficiency (eg, recipients of organ transplants). In HIV-positive patients, BL typically affects those with a relatively high CD4 count (eg, &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> and no opportunistic infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In comparison to the majority of other HIV-associated lymphomas, the rate of BL in the HIV-positive population has not decreased with the advent of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART). This is presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathobiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7524115\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is derived from germinal or post-germinal center B cells. The development of BL is dependent on the constitutive expression of the <em>MYC</em> proto-oncogene located at chromosome 8q24, which encodes the MYC protein transcription factor. This transcription factor modulates the expression of target genes that regulate many cell processes including cell growth and division, immortalization, Warburg metabolism, and cell death by apoptosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology of Burkitt lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The <em>MYC</em> chromosomal translocation that characterizes BL has the molecular signature of a mistake that occurs during the attempted diversification of immunoglobulin gene segments in B cells. Chromosomal translocations involve non-homologous joining of the ends of DNA breaks that occur in at least two different places in the genome simultaneously. Cloning and sequencing of the genomic sequences where <em>MYC</em> is joined to Ig loci in BL clearly indicate that the DNA breaks in the involved Ig genes occur through processes that are normal for B cells, namely either attempted Ig V(D)J recombination or Ig class switch recombination. Some papers suggest that DNA breaks near <em>MYC</em> result from the recruitment of activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID), an enzyme required for immunoglobulin class switching, to enhancer sites adjacent to the <em>MYC</em> gene body that are characterized by overlapping sense and antisense (convergent) transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. It is not known how the DNA breaks in <em>MYC</em> come to be spatially close to DNA breaks in the Ig locus in the interphase nucleus, which is a prerequisite for these DNA ends to be joined to form <em>MYC</em> translocations. The resulting dysregulation of <em>MYC</em> is complemented by additional mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors (described below); the basis for the genesis of these mutations is largely unknown.</p><p>Chronic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection appears to play a role in virtually all cases of endemic (African) BL and a minority of sporadic and immunodeficiency-associated BL. Work in mouse models suggests that malaria selectively induces B cell lymphomas with chromosomal translocations involving <em>MYC</em> by causing protracted AID expression in germinal center B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Primary involvement of the abdomen is less common. The primary tumor can spread to extranodal sites including the mesentery, ovary, testis, kidney, breast, and meninges. Primary involvement of the peripheral lymph nodes, mediastinum, and spleen are uncommon. Bone marrow involvement is seen in less than 10 percent of patients at the time of initial presentation but is a common complication of recurrent or treatment resistant disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The non-endemic (sporadic) form usually has an abdominal presentation, most often with massive disease and ascites, involving the distal ileum, stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69159\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69159 \">picture 2</a>), cecum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mesentery, kidney, testis, ovary, breast, bone marrow, or central nervous system (CNS). Presenting symptoms can include those related to bowel obstruction or gastrointestinal bleeding, often mimicking acute appendicitis or intussusception. Approximately 25 percent of cases will have involvement of the jaw or facial bones. Lymphadenopathy, if present, is generally localized. Bone marrow and CNS involvement occurs in approximately 30 and 15 percent of cases, respectively, at the time of initial presentation, but are common complications of recurrent or treatment resistant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presentation of patients with immunodeficiency-related BL is often accompanied by signs or symptoms related to the underlying immunodeficiency (eg, AIDS, congenital immunodeficiency, acquired immunodeficiency due to hematopoietic or solid organ transplantation).

Such cases were classified as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, L3 type, in the French-American-British (FAB) group classification system.

At low power, the tumor has a &quot;moth-eaten&quot; appearance, often with interspersed areas of coagulative necrosis or hemorrhage. There is an extremely high rate of proliferation as well as a high rate of apoptotic cell death. A classic &quot;starry-sky&quot; pattern is usually present, imparted by numerous benign macrophages (histiocytes) that have ingested apoptotic tumor cells (ie, tingible body macrophages) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65094\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65094 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52925\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52925 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59619\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59619 \">picture 5</a>). The benign histiocytes (&quot;the stars&quot;) are large with abundant, clear cytoplasm and are dispersed relatively evenly throughout a background of basophilic tumor cells (&quot;the sky&quot;).</p><p>At higher power, Burkitt lymphoma (BL) tumor cells classically are monomorphic, medium-sized cells with round nuclei, multiple dark nucleoli, and basophilic cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57366\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57366 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72438\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72438 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Cytologically, these cells resemble the small non-cleaved cells within normal germinal centers of the secondary lymphoid follicle. Prominent cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles are usually evident on air-dried imprints or smears. The interspersed benign histiocytes are large and irregularly shaped with abundant, clear cytoplasm, pale nuclei, and inconspicuous nucleoli.</p><p>The growth fraction of these lymphomas is very high, with frequent mitotic figures being seen and the fraction of Ki-67+ (MIB-1+) cells approaching 100 percent.</p><p>Several morphologic variants may be seen. Occasionally the tumor cells are associated with a marked granulomatous reaction, which may be so profound as to obscure the tumor cells lurking in the background. Other tumors may have single centrally placed nucleoli and eccentric cytoplasm, producing a plasmacytoid appearance. Another variant is marked by greater nuclear pleomorphism and more prominent nucleoli than are typical of &quot;classic&quot; forms of BL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunophenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tumor cells express surface immunoglobulin (Ig) of the IgM type and immunoglobulin light chains (kappa more often than lambda), B cell-associated antigens (CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a), germinal center-associated markers (CD10 and BCL6), as well as HLA-DR and CD43 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50088\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50088 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They lack expression of CD5, B cell <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span> 2 (BCL2), TdT, and typically lack expression of CD23. BCL6 protein staining is in a nuclear pattern and independent of <em>BCL6</em> gene rearrangement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Expression of CD21, the Epstein-Barr virus <span class=\"nowrap\">(EBV)/C3d</span> receptor, is dependent on EBV status of the tumors. Essentially all cases of endemic BL are EBV positive and express CD21, whereas the vast majority of non-endemic BL in non-immunosuppressed patients are EBV negative and lack CD21 expression. EBV involvement in BL occurring in the setting of immunodeficiency falls between these two extremes. For example, 25 to 40 percent of BL occurring in HIV-positive patients are EBV associated, as are a high fraction of BL associated with organ transplantation. BL generally lacks the adhesion molecules LFA-1 <span class=\"nowrap\">(CD11a/CD18),</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">p150/95</span> (CD11c), and CD44. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The immunophenotype of the BL variants is very similar to BL, although expression of surface immunoglobulin (sIg), CD10, and CD21 is more variable.

Most African cases contain clonal EBV genomes, as do 25 to 40 percent of the cases associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>In a study involving 33 children and 37 adults with BL, in which all subjects had translocations involving chromosome 8, additional abnormalities were present in 81 and 73 percent of the children and adults, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The most commonly observed abnormalities involved chromosomes 1, 6, 13, 17, and 22. Of these, only abnormalities of chromosome 17 were poor prognostic features in adults.</p><p>The potential value of gene expression profiling (GEP) in diagnosing BL was illustrated in two large studies that identified a characteristic molecular signature that was able to differentiate BL from diffuse large B cell lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. While use of GEP has not found its way into clinical practice to establish the diagnosis of BL, new approaches that simplify the detection of RNA signature (eg, Nanostring analysis, which has been proposed as a means for sub-classification of diffuse large B cell lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]) may make use of GEP more attractive in the future.</p><p>Next-generation sequencing studies of BL have revealed that all three subtypes are frequently associated with mutations in the transcription factor <em>TCF3</em> (also known as <em>E2A</em>, 10 to 25 percent of cases) or a negative regulator of TCF3, ID3 (35 to 58 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Notably, the <em>ID3</em> mutations are loss-of-function mutations, whereas most <em>TCF3</em> mutations are gain-of-function mutations that abrogate ID3 binding to TCF3. Mutations in these genes are rare in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and other B cell lymphomas, suggesting that TCF3 gain of function is a defining lesion in BL.

Less commonly, involvement of typical extranodal sites of disease is absent and the diagnosis is made through pathologic evaluation of another tissue (eg, lymph node, lung, kidney, testicle). A discussion of tissue biopsy, including a general discussion of pathologic testing, is presented separately.

Cytogenetic analysis demonstrates a translocation involving the <em>MYC</em> gene on chromosome 8. Rearrangements involving <em>MYC</em> can usually be detected by routine cytogenetics, but can also be demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using fluorescent probes that are commercially available.</p><p>Whether <em>MYC</em> rearrangement is essential for the diagnosis has been questioned by studies showing that up to 5 percent of tumors with features that are otherwise typical of BL lack <em>MYC</em> rearrangements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/31,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35</a>].

Many of the cases that were previously categorized as BL in the absence of a <em>MYC</em> rearrangement are better classified as the new provisional entity &quot;Burkitt-like lymphoma with 11q aberration&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; however, this remains a problematic diagnostic area since screening for 11q aberrations is not routine at most centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for Burkitt lymphoma (BL) includes other tumors that can present as abdominal masses or facial tumors and other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

These borderline cases are associated with a high degree of inter- and intra-observer variation among hematopathologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In children and HIV-positive patients, these tumors often have <em>MYC</em> translocations and behave similarly to typical BL, while in adults without HIV infection these cases more often are &quot;double-hit&quot; lymphomas with <em>MYC</em> and <em>BCL2</em> gene rearrangements and are thought to represent an aggressive variant of DLBCL that in some cases may arise from transformation of an underlying follicular lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Regardless of the context, accurate diagnosis of BL versus DLBCL is essential for choosing the most appropriate therapy.</p><p>The 2008 version of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system provided an overlap category termed &quot;B cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

However, BL cells differ from lymphoblastic lymphoma cells in several respects; they have intermediate-sized oval or round nuclei, more dispersed chromatin, several distinct nuclei, and more abundant cytoplasm. Also, lymphoblastic lymphomas express TdT, are often of T cell phenotype, and when of B cell origin fail to express surface immunoglobulin. Thus, flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry can distinguish BL from lymphoblastic lymphoma with a high degree of certainty.

However, cases of the blastoid variant of MCL may resemble BL morphologically. The blastoid variant of MCL is comprised of intermediate-sized cells with dispersed chromatin, irregular nuclear contours, and scant cytoplasm with a high mitotic rate. MCL can usually be distinguished from BL by its immunophenotype. While both entities express surface IgM and B cell-associated antigens, most cases of MCL express CD5 and do not express CD10 (unlike BL). In addition, nuclear staining for cyclin D1 is present in 95 percent of cases of MCL.

Although they are histologically identical and have similar clinical behavior, there are differences in epidemiology, clinical presentation, and genetic features between the three forms. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BL comprises 30 percent of non-endemic pediatric lymphomas, but &lt;1 percent of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The endemic variant is found in equatorial Africa while the sporadic variant is seen in the United States and Western Europe. Endemic and sporadic BLs are both most common in children, and the majority of patients are male. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with BL present with rapidly growing tumor masses and often have evidence of tumor lysis. The endemic form presents as a jaw or facial bone tumor that spreads to extranodal sites while the non-endemic (sporadic) form has an abdominal presentation, most often with massive disease. Immunodeficiency-related cases more often involve lymph nodes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BL tumor cells are monomorphic, medium-sized cells with round nuclei, multiple nucleoli, and basophilic cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57366\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57366 \">picture 6</a>). Prominent cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles are usually evident on imprints or smears. There is an extremely high rate of proliferation, as well as a high rate of apoptotic cell death as evidenced by a Ki-67+ (MIB-1+) cells fraction approaching 100 percent and a &quot;starry-sky&quot; pattern. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Morphology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BL cells express surface IgM and B cell-associated antigens (CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a), as well as CD10, HLA-DR, and CD43. They lack CD5, BCL-2, TdT, and typically lack CD23. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immunophenotype'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BL is strongly (but not uniformly) associated with a translocation between the long arm of chromosome 8, the site of the <em>MYC</em> oncogene (8q24), and one of three locations on Ig genes: t(8;14), t(2;8), or t(8;22). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Genetic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of BL is based on the pathologic evaluation of involved tissue, usually an abdominal mass.
