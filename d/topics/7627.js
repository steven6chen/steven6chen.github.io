GD is one of the most common lysosomal storage diseases. Glucocerebroside (also called glucosylceramide) and several related compounds that ordinarily are degraded to glucose and lipid components accumulate within the lysosomes of cells.</p><p>GD is categorized into three clinical types. The disease involves the visceral organs, bone marrow, and bone in almost all affected patients. Type 1 (GD1, MIM #230800) is the most common. It is distinguished from type 2 (GD2, MIM #230900) and type 3 (GD3, MIM #231000) by the lack of characteristic involvement of the central nervous system (CNS).</p><p>Additional resources for information about GD for patients and families are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63615\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63615 \">table 1</a>).
