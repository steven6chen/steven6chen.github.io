Major risk factors for nosocomial meningitis include neurosurgery or head trauma within the past month, presence of a neurosurgical device, and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. While Gram-negative bacilli remain an uncommon cause of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults, the frequency of cases arising from the community has increased substantially, from 3 percent of cases in older studies to over 75 percent of episodes in one newer study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> is now the most common Gram-negative bacterium causing Gram-negative bacillary meningitis in the neurosurgical setting in parts of Europe, followed by <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]<em>.</em></p><p>Gram-negative bacillary meningitis is often fatal with reported mortality rates of 40 to 80 percent in adults and children, and complications are common in patients who survive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. As an example, the mortality rates among adults with both spontaneous and post-neurosurgical gram-negative bacillary meningitis in two studies were 53 and 57 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. These mortality rates were almost 20 times higher than the mortality rate of spontaneous bacterial meningitis due to <em>Neisseria meningitides</em> in adults, as reported in one of those same studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In another study conducted over a 21-year period, 61 percent of infants who survived gram-negative meningitis had developmental disabilities and neurologic sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis will be reviewed here.

Despite appropriate therapy and an apparent clinical response, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures may remain positive for as long as 13 days after treatment is begun [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The average duration of therapy needed to sterilize the CSF is two to four days in adults and 2.8 to 8.2 days in neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a series of 98 neonates and infants, positive results were obtained on CSF cultures for one to 18 days after the commencement of antibiotic therapy (mean 2.9 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The longer the CSF remains positive in neonates, the greater the chance of neurologic deficits in the survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimicrobial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective antimicrobial therapy for gram-negative bacillary meningitis is limited by several factors.

Bacterial meningitis should be treated with an antibiotic agent that penetrates the CSF in adequate concentrations to exhibit bactericidal activity against the responsible pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial therapy and prognosis of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>). Patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis who are treated with bacteriostatic antibiotics have poor clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Bactericidal activity of antibiotic therapy in the CSF is affected by the penetration, concentration, and intrinsic activity of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The minimum concentration of a drug in the CSF needed for bactericidal activity is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. We agree with authorities who advocate that selected antibiotic regimens should achieve CSF levels 10 or more times above the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Choice of antimicrobial drugs'</a> below.) </p><p>Intrathecal or intraventricular therapy (with aminoglycosides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polymyxin B</a>) is sometimes used concomitantly with intravenous therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. These invasive methods of delivery overcome the problem of poor penetration of both aminoglycosides and colistin into the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend that dosages and intervals of intraventricular antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted to achieve CSF antimicrobial concentrations of 10 to 20 times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the causative microorganism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]</p><p>Of note, these local methods of delivery were ineffective in neonates and were also associated with poorer outcomes when compared with intravenous therapy in some older studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no comparative studies that examine the impact of duration of treatment in patients with gram-negative meningitis on outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. We recommend at least 21 days of therapy because high rates of relapse occur in patients treated with shorter courses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23</a>]. However, the length of therapy ultimately should be tailored to the observed response of individual patients.</p><p>The CSF should be reanalyzed after the commencement of therapy to assess response. There are no definitive published data on the ideal timing of repeat LP. Since the average duration of therapy needed to sterilize the CSF in adults is two to four days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], we suggest that the CSF be resampled after four to five days of therapy. In patients with repeatedly positive CSF cultures on appropriate antimicrobial therapy, treatment should be continued for 10 to 14 days following the last positive culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of dexamethasone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dexamethasone</a> is <strong>not</strong> warranted for management of raised intracranial pressure and of the inflammation associated with gram-negative bacillary meningitis, given the lack of evidence for benefit and risk of toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Although treatment of raised intracranial pressure and of the inflammation associated with bacterial meningitis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> improves the neurologic outcome in selected children and adults, trials have not generally included patients with gram-negative infections.

Relapses and chronicity were common with gram-negative bacillary meningitis until highly active cephalosporins were first released [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cephalosporins</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Third generation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Broad-spectrum cephalosporins have been the treatment of choice for gram-negative bacillary meningitis since the late 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. These antibiotics have good in vitro activity against gram-negative pathogens and they penetrate extremely well into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Clinical outcomes improved remarkably since their introduction; success rates of 85 to 90 percent were reported in selected studies when these drugs were initially used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> is effective in treating meningitis due to <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> (cure rate 70 to 75 percent, with or without concomitant systemic aminoglycoside therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>However, third generation cephalosporins have limited role for CNS infections due to <em>Enterobacter</em>, <em>Serratia</em>, <em>Pseudomonas </em>(other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a>), and <em>Acinetobacter</em>. In one study, third generation cephalosporins also did not reduce the mortality rate in cases of <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Nine percent of patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis had isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in one series of patients treated over a 12-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In another series of patients treated over a six-year period, 25 percent of isolates were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The authors noted an increase in resistance to these drugs from 1994 onwards. Cephalosporin-resistant pathogens included <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em>, <em>K. pneumoniae</em>, <em>Citrobacter freundii</em> and <em>Morganella morganii</em>. These authors cautioned that third-generation cephalosporin resistance should be highly suspected in cases of nosocomially-acquired post-neurosurgical gram-negative meningitis.</p><p>In addition to the problem of innate resistance, the emergence of resistance to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics occurred in 14 to 56 percent of patients infected with gram-negative bacilli that possess inducible beta-lactamases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This type of secondary resistance to beta-lactam agents was present in 30 percent of cases of meningitis due to <em>Enterobacter</em> in a case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, a case report has highlighted the management challenge of nosocomial meningitis due to ESBL-positive <em>K. pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. As a result of the above observations, monotherapy with a third generation cephalosporin should only be continued when the identity of the organism and its susceptibility patterns are known is known and secondary resistance is deemed to be unlikely to occur.</p><p>Serial testing for the emergence of resistance during therapy of gram-negative meningitis may be warranted even when initial in vitro susceptibility is documented. Such emergence of resistance during therapy is illustrated by a case report of two patients with <em>Enterobacter cloacae</em> meningitis who developed serial step-wise decreases in susceptibility to cephalosporins during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. For this reason, some authors recommend that initial therapy for patients with gram-negative meningitis include an aminoglycoside plus a third-generation cephalosporin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Fourth or later generation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The in vitro data on fourth generation cephalosporins suggest that these drugs may have utility in the treatment of gram-negative meningitis.

Careful calculation of dose and careful attention to the diluents used to administer IT or IVT therapy are critically important issues when antibiotics are given through these routes.
