Angioedema of the pharynx, larynx, and subglottic area have also been reported. Early signs of laryngeal edema may include hoarseness of the throat and inspiratory stridor, which may progress to airway obstruction in up to 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>].

In most of these reports, diagnosis was delayed by months to years, because clinicians were not as aware of this potential presentation of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>].</p><p>In more than one-half of the case reports of visceral angioedema, symptoms began within 72 hours of starting ACE inhibitor therapy, although in other reports, angioedema developed after weeks or years of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/28,29,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,35</a>]. The jejunum is most often involved, followed by the ileum and duodenum.

The pathophysiologic reasons for this pattern are not known. A history of preceding episodes with long symptom-free intervals is not unusual, especially in the case of abdominal or visceral angioedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/22,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,29</a>]. If the ACE inhibitor is <strong>not</strong> discontinued, the episode will still resolve, although the frequency and severity of future episodes appears to escalate, and the condition can become life-threatening. (See <a href=\"#H1070522\" class=\"local\">'Discontinue ACE inhibitor'</a> below.)</p><p>In more than one-half of cases, angioedema occurs during the first week of exposure, although it may occur any time during the course of therapy from hours to years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/10,31,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,31,39,40</a>]. In the large retrospective study mentioned previously, two-thirds of angioedema episodes occurred within the first three months of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

However, endotracheal intubation or emergent tracheostomy may be necessary for angioedema obstructing the airway, and fatalities have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9838053\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema are related to elevated levels of bradykinin, an inflammatory vasoactive peptide, which leads to vasodilation of blood vessels. The pathways involved in bradykinin generation are described briefly here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4335290\"><span class=\"h2\">ACE inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACE inhibitors block the effects of the enzyme ACE, also known as kininase II, and impact both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) pathway and the degradation of bradykinin. The RAA cascade is important for regulating renal blood flow and blood pressure. Angiotensinogen, produced in the liver, is converted by renin in the kidney to produce angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then metabolized to angiotensin II in the lungs by the enzyme ACE (kininase II). Angiotensin II acts as a vasoconstrictor through stimulation of angiotensin I and II receptors.</p><p>Angiotensin II is also responsible for inactivating bradykinin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], while ACE (kininase II) is the primary peptidase involved in the degradation of bradykinin. Bradykinin is a peptide made of nine amino acids that increases capillary permeability and acts as a potent vasodilator. The production of bradykinin occurs after the precursor kininogen is cleaved by kallikrein, which leads to production of the active form of bradykinin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82805\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82805 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Bradykinin has a very short half-life (approximately 17 seconds) and is metabolized primarily by ACE (kininase II), neutral endopeptidase (NEP), and aminopeptidase P (APP) and secondarily by the enzymes dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and kininase I. Des-Arg9-BK is an active metabolite of bradykinin formed primarily due to the kininase I enzyme. The pharmacologic activities of des-Arg9-BK, similar to those of bradykinin, are short-lived because of its breakdown by ACE and APP.</p><p>Thus, ACE inhibitor therapy has the following effects in all patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initially, vasodilation due to inhibited production of angiotensin II</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronically, angiotensin II returns to pretreatment levels through alternative pathways of production by tissue chymases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bradykinin levels become elevated due to impaired metabolism, which leads to release of nitric oxide and prostaglandins and results in vasodilatation and hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levels of des-Arg9-BK, the breakdown product of bradykinin, become elevated</p><p/><p>In addition, a small study found that serum levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin F<sub>1</sub>-alpha, a breakdown product of prostaglandins with a longer half-life, increased significantly with 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> doses as a result of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramipril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramipril</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Further studies are necessary to determine if this will be a clinically useful biomarker in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4335305\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of bradykinin in angioedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated plasma bradykinin activity has been demonstrated in patients with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A case report demonstrated a 10-fold increase in bradykinin levels during an episode of angioedema due to use of the ACE inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> and returned to normal levels during remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/43,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,48</a>]. High levels of bradykinin stimulate vasodilation and increased vascular permeability of the postcapillary venules and allows for plasma extravasation into the submucosal tissue, leading to angioedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/43,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,49</a>]. Substance P can also increase vascular permeability, leading to angioedema.</p><p>ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is thought to result from defective degradation of at least three vasoactive peptides: bradykinin, des-Arg9-BK (a metabolite of bradykinin), and substance P [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>Normally, bradykinin is inactivated by ACE, APP, DPP-4, and NEP, as mentioned previously. The APP-inactivated bradykinin metabolite, des-Arg9-BK, is also degraded by DPP-4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Substance P is inactivated primarily by the enzyme DPP-4, although ACE and NEP play a secondary role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Decreased activity of DPP-4 correlated to a prolonged half-life of substance P but only in the presence of ACE inhibition, suggesting a requirement for multiple enzyme defects to inhibit degradation.</p><p>When ACE is inhibited by drug therapy, the secondary bradykinin metabolic enzymes (APP, kininase I, NEP, and DPP-4) play a relatively larger role in degrading bradykinin, des-Arg9-BK, and substance P. Thus, defects or deficiencies in these enzymes theoretically predispose patients to developing angioedema when taking an ACE inhibitor. Studies that support this mechanism include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased APP activity was demonstrated in the sera of 39 Caucasian patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema, as compared with 39 ACE inhibitor-exposed controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased DPP-4 antigen and activity levels were found in the sera of 50 patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema, as compared with 176 ACE inhibitor-exposed controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition to the above, approximately one-half of patients experiencing ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema also have an enzyme defect involved in des-Arg9-BK metabolism, leading to its accumulation when ACE is inhibited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9838060\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both environmental and genetic factors have been shown to influence the development of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/11-14,52-55,57-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14,52-55,57-61</a>].

However, in cases where angioedema persisted beyond several weeks, it is also possible that ACE inhibitors were not the true culprit or that the patient had an underlying predisposition to develop angioedema that was exacerbated (but not entirely caused) by the presence of an ACE inhibitor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20395068\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE USE OF OTHER RELATED DRUGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drugs mechanistically related to ACE inhibitors include angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), renin inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9838109\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiotensin II receptor blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardioprotective effects of angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) are similar to those of ACE inhibitors, and the mechanism by which ARBs would theoretically precipitate angioedema is not clear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82805\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82805 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Therefore, we do not believe that ARBs should be avoided in patients with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema if ARB therapy offers an advantage over other antihypertensives for that individual patient.</p><p>The following studies found a low incidence of angioedema in patients receiving ARBs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large study of 467,313 patients who were initiated on ARB therapy, there were 288 angioedema events, and the cumulative incidence was similar in ARBs and beta-blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of data from 19 trials, the overall incidence of angioedema with ARBs was not significantly different from placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This analysis included 35,479 patients (mean age 61 years, 59 percent men) of whom 52 developed angioedema during a mean duration of 120 weeks, for a weighted incidence of 0.11 percent (95% CI 0.09-0.13).</p><p/><p>Systematic reviews of the literature describe a 1.5 to 10 percent rate of recurrent angioedema in patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema that were switched to an ARB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>]. This relatively high rate of recurrence may be attributable to the phenomena discussed previously, (ie, that patients with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema may have one or more additional episodes of angioedema in the weeks to months after the ACE inhibitor is discontinued). (See <a href=\"#H3112223171\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p>We specifically counsel patients that they could have a recurrence of angioedema and review with them how to proceed if this should occur. Another approach is to wait four to six weeks after an ACE inhibitor is discontinued before starting an ARB. However, this is only appropriate if the patient can safely go without the medication for this period of time.</p><p>A small series of 11 patients who developed oral or airway angioedema while receiving ARB therapy found that time to remission was 5 to 7 hours in three patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icatibant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icatibant</a>, compared with 24 to 54 hours in those treated with glucocorticoids and antihistamines or observation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

Renin inhibitors are thought to provide a more comprehensive inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system compared with ACE inhibitors and ARBs and appear to have different safety profiles. Theoretically, aliskiren should not confer a risk of bradykinin-induced angioedema, because unlike ACE inhibitors, it has no known effect on bradykinin metabolism.

ACE inhibitors are the leading cause of drug-induced angioedema, accounting for up to 40 percent of emergency visits for angioedema. (See <a href=\"#H20394732\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema usually affects the lips, tongue, and face, although visceral edema presenting as acute abdominal pain is also possible. Urticaria and itching are absent. Symptoms typically begin during the first week of treatment, although some cases develop after years of uneventful therapy. (See <a href=\"#H20393568\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema are related to elevated levels of bradykinin, an inflammatory vasoactive peptide, which leads to vasodilation of blood vessels. The risk of angioedema with an ACE inhibitor is not related to agent or dose. Lower levels or defects in enzymes that degrade bradykinin and similar compounds may predispose certain patients to angioedema, which is one identified reason that patients of African descent are more susceptible. (See <a href=\"#H9838053\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9838060\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is made clinically, as there are no definitive laboratory tests that are routinely available to diagnose ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. Resolution following discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor confirms the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H20395298\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary acute treatment of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is supportive care until the angioedema resolves. Careful attention to the airway is critical if tongue or laryngeal swelling is present, because airway obstruction occurs in up to 10 percent of cases. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required. (See <a href=\"#H9838067\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapies for hereditary angioedema (HAE), a disorder that is also bradykinin-mediated, may be beneficial in ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema, but studies are conflicting and early administration appears to be critical, such that the real world utility of these agents is limited. Thus, we do not advocate using them in most situations. However, for the rare patient who presents with severe and worsening angioedema potentially compromising the airway, in whom symptoms began no more than approximately six hours earlier, bradykinin-targeting therapies may be beneficial. (See <a href=\"#H1070652\" class=\"local\">'Therapies of unproven efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be counseled that angioedema can recur in the first few months after stopping an ACE inhibitor and given advice about how to proceed if symptoms develop again.
