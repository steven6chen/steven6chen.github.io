The choice is based upon availability, gestational age (medication abortion is less successful in the late first trimester), and patient preference. Women seeking abortion care should be counseled about the advantages and disadvantages of both options.</p><p>Prior to 2000, medication abortion in the first trimester was available only using a prostaglandin with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. Since 2000, medication abortion with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> was approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. Surgical abortion is still performed in the majority of cases and also in cases in which medication abortion is incomplete. The United States Centers for disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that, in 2013, 22.2 percent of abortions at &le;8 weeks of gestation and 1.2 percent at &gt;8 weeks were performed with medication alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>First-trimester surgical abortion is effective in terminating pregnancy in 98 to 99 percent of procedures and has a complication rate of 0 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The major complications of surgical abortion are incomplete evacuation, uterine perforation, problems related to anesthesia, and endometritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration#H4291371502\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester pregnancy termination: Uterine aspiration&quot;, section on 'Outcome and complications'</a>.)</p><p>The overall success rate of medication abortion with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> is not quite as high as its surgical counterpart; surgical aspiration to complete the termination is required in 2 to 8 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Incomplete evacuation is considered failure of the method rather than a complication.</p><p>In terms of complications, data from Planned Parenthood affiliates in 2009 to 2010 that included 233,805 medication abortions showed significant adverse events or outcomes occurred in 0.65 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The complication rate for medication abortion is similar to surgical abortion, but the types and etiologies of the complications are different. Endometritis has a similar incidence as in surgical abortion; life-threatening infections are rare, but have occurred more often than with surgical abortion. Hemorrhage occurs at similar rates, but the cause is typically uterine atony or retained products of conception rather than the causes in surgical abortion, which are usually cervical laceration or uterine injury due to instrumentation. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Side effects and complications'</a> below.)</p><p>The teratogenic risk to an ongoing pregnancy is higher with medication abortion than with surgical abortion, but ongoing pregnancy is rare. (See <a href=\"#H1068566\" class=\"local\">'Teratogenicity'</a> below.)</p><p>The main difference between surgical and medication abortion is the patient's experience. The surgical procedure is completed in one office visit and takes place in a healthcare facility. Patients experience a gynecologic procedure in the lithotomy position and then leave the visit knowing that the abortion is complete. Analgesics or anesthesia may be used, but there may be some discomfort during the procedure and mild to moderate uterine cramping and bleeding for several days afterward.</p><p>Medication abortion avoids a surgical procedure and anesthesia, but takes a longer time (several days) and usually one more clinic visit than a surgical abortion. The patient usually experiences more uncomfortable effects and over a longer period of time (bleeding, cramping, nausea, vomiting). The patient has a greater awareness of the blood loss and may be able to identify pregnancy tissue that passes. Some patients prefer the greater degree of control they have over the process and having part of the process in a nonclinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, some patients will require a surgical abortion if the medication abortion is unsuccessful. If the patient has an ongoing pregnancy, there is a risk of fetal abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H1068566\" class=\"local\">'Teratogenicity'</a> below.)</p><p>Acceptability is high for both medication and surgical abortion, but satisfaction appears to be higher after surgical abortion. This was illustrated in two randomized trials that found that the rate of patient satisfaction was significantly higher for surgical abortion (92 verus 82 percent in one trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; 94 versus 69 percent in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]). In contrast, in a prospective cohort study, a higher proportion of women who underwent medication abortion would choose the same method if a future abortion was required (81 versus 58 percent in the surgical abortion group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Given the available data, we suggest first-trimester medication abortion for eligible women who place a high value on avoiding surgery or anesthesia and who are willing to accept more discomfort and awareness of the procedure. For other women, particularly those who place a high value on completing the procedure in one visit, we recommend surgical abortion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The US Food and Drug Administration has approved <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> for termination of intrauterine pregnancy up to 70 days of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>According to the manufacturer of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a>, pregnancy is dated from the first day of the last menstrual period in a presumed 28-day cycle with ovulation occurring at mid-cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The duration of pregnancy may be determined from menstrual history and by clinical examination. Ultrasonographic scan should be used if the duration of pregnancy is uncertain, or if ectopic pregnancy is suspected. Use beyond this gestational age is off-label. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'After 49 days of gestation'</a> below.)</p><p>The alternative to medication termination is surgical termination of pregnancy. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed above.

Although some prostaglandins result in bronchoconstriction, this effect has not been found with prostaglandin E1 (misoprostol). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asthma-during-pregnancy#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asthma during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Peripartum care'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1715339\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no data regarding safety and efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> medication abortion for women with chronic medical conditions (eg, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, or renal disease) or who are cigarette smokers. Therefore, the labeling of mifepristone for medication abortion advises caution in women with these conditions. If medical conditions are well controlled, medication abortion can be provided safely, but clinical judgment must be used regarding the individual&rsquo;s risks and alternatives. For medical conditions that are poorly controlled and in which there is clinical concern for excessive blood loss or a need for monitoring, surgical abortion under controlled conditions is generally preferable.</p><p>Drug interactions with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> should be investigated for patients who are on other medications. Mifepristone is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), and thus may theoretically interact with agents that impact CYP3A4 function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 2</a>). However, specific drug or food interactions with the single dose of mifepristone used for pregnancy termination have not been reported. Even if interactions were shown to alter serum concentrations, those concentrations are not correlated with efficacy and ingestion of a single dose in the range of 200 mg up to 800 mg produces approximately the same serum concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mifepristone</a> itself acts as a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 metabolism and can thereby alter concentrations of other drugs. Due to its prolonged half-life and irreversible CYP binding, potential interactions of mifepristone should be checked particularly for medications that have a narrow therapeutic index.&nbsp;Examples include: immunosuppressants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>); cardiovascular drugs (eg, calcium channel blockers, anti-arrhythmics, others); <span class=\"nowrap\">analgesic/anesthetic</span> agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, others). The effect of a single dose of mifepristone on metabolism and effect of other drugs highly dependent upon CYP3A4 for their metabolism or activation may persist for up to two weeks. Interactions with these medications should be checked prior to administration of mifepristone.</p><p>Some medications that inhibit CYP3A4 metabolism are associated with QT interval prolongation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There are no reported cases of QT prolongation with use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a>. The manufacturer of mifepristone advises that use of the medication should be avoided with QT interval-prolonging drugs or in patients with potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The rate of infection following medication abortion is low, approximately 0.3 percent in prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/28,30,49,51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,49,51-53</a>]. However, some cases of serious infection do occur. In particular, there have been rare cases of sepsis and death in women with clostridial infections. A possible contributing factor to these infections was use of a vaginal route for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>. No further cases have been found since most clinicians and large clinical organizations modified their practice to include one or more of the following interventions: use of prophylactic antibiotics, use of a non-vaginal route of administration, or counseling about seeking medical attention in case of signs of life-threatening infection. However, it is uncertain whether these interventions, and which intervention, has prevented further cases of clostridial sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Fever and infection'</a> below.)</p><p>There are no randomized trials regarding use of prophylactic antibiotics for first-trimester medication abortion. The largest study was an observational study conducted by Planned Parenthood of over 227,000 women with gestational ages up to 63 days who underwent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a></span> abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]; the rate of serious infection decreased from 0.93 to 0.06 per 1000 women with use of prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days, starting on the day of mifepristone administration) compared with no antimicrobial prophylaxis. Doxycycline provides coverage for chlamydia, most gonorrhea strains, and has in vitro efficacy against clostridial species. Based on these data, the number needed to treat with a week of doxycycline is more than 5000 women to prevent one serious infection requiring intravenous antibiotics. Of note, during the time period of the study, the route of administration of misoprostol was also changed from vaginal to buccal; therefore, it is possible that this is also partially responsible for the decrease in infection rate.</p><p>The disadvantages of routine use of prophylactic antibiotics include: cost, increased complexity of the regimen, and antibiotic resistance.</p><p>The Society of Family Planning (SFP) states that, although individual practitioners may decide to use antibiotics with provision of medication abortion, the SFP does not believe universal antibiotics is required for all women having a medication abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. They also make the following recommendation based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence: although the risk of serious infection is low, recent data indicate that there may be significant reduction in the risk of serious infection by providing treatment doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> starting at the time the medication abortion treatment is initiated.</p><p>Given the available evidence, we suggest universal use of antibiotic prophylaxis for first-trimester medication abortion. This is a reasonable choice for those who value potential prevention of rare cases of severe infection more than the disadvantages associated with routine antibiotic use.</p><p>Since decisions regarding use of prophylactic antibiotics are made based upon weak evidence, we advise that the women undergoing first-trimester medication abortion be counseled about this controversy and be involved in making this decision on an individual basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16672532\"><span class=\"h3\">Further instructions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should be given further instructions regarding returning to clinic for a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> dose or self-administration.</p><p>Written and verbal instructions should be given regarding symptoms and adverse effects and what to do in the case of significant pain, bleeding, or other adverse reactions.

To reduce the need for an additional visit, studies have evaluated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of self-assessment rather than a clinic visit for confirmation of abortion completion. Self-assessment appears to result in similar rates of detection of incomplete expulsion (the abortion is incomplete) and complications, but not ongoing pregnancy (the pregnancy continues to develop). Thus, self-assessment is not commonly used due to concerns about rare cases of undetected ongoing pregnancy (approximately 1 percent), which may not be detected until the second trimester. Incomplete expulsion and complications (eg, infection) are usually symptomatic, prompting evaluation for prolonged or heavy bleeding or fever, but ongoing pregnancy may not have concerning symptoms that alert the patient, and therefore may go undetected into the second trimester.</p><p>Research evaluating self-assessment for medication abortion outcome have found that the risk of an undiagnosed ongoing pregnancy increases with increasing gestational age at the time of treatment and decreases with an approach that combines use of a home pregnancy test with standardization of both the questions and criteria used for counseling and telephone follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-58</a>]. For protocols that use this type of approach, a systematic review of follow-up protocols included eight comparative studies and found that the sensitivity for detecting an ongoing pregnancy was &ge;90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. It is important to note that all but one of the studies in the systematic review utilized a low sensitivity urine pregnancy test (a positive result requires a urine human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL);</span> these tests are commercially available in Europe, but not in the United States.</p><p>A randomized trial of women who underwent medication abortion at &lt;63 days of gestation (n = 924) compared self-assessment (a low sensitivity urine hCG test to be performed within three weeks posttreatment and a phone call at one month) with a routine postabortion clinic visit (urine or serum hCG testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ultrasound) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Interestingly, among women who declined to participate in the trial, a common reason was the desire to avoid follow-up visits, and trial participants reported that they prefer self-assessment to a routine clinic visit. Similar to previous studies, the self-assessment group and routine follow-up groups had similar rates of complete abortion (94 and 95 percent), but the self-assessment group had three cases of ongoing pregnancy that were not detected by the urine hCG test and all were discovered in the second trimester, compared with no ongoing pregnancies in the routine follow-up group. Thus, to reliably detect ongoing pregnancy, we recommend a follow-up clinic visit with clinical evaluation. If self-assessment is strongly desired or a clinic visit is not possible, clinicians should counsel on both the risk and the symptoms of ongoing pregnancy, and follow a protocol that includes use of urine pregnancy testing and a standardized telephone encounter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711462\"><span class=\"h3\">Confirming complete abortion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confirming complete expulsion of the pregnancy involves taking a history and performing a pelvic examination; ultrasound examination is also performed by most clinicians. Women who do not expel the pregnancy after medication abortion require surgical evacuation.

The need for medical confirmation of pregnancy termination must be emphasized to users of this method, and women must be informed of the possibility of congenital abnormalities in the event that pregnancy continues. (See <a href=\"#H1068566\" class=\"local\">'Teratogenicity'</a> below.)</p><p>A history of vaginal bleeding and cramping is not sufficient evidence that the pregnancy has been terminated. A lack of bleeding, however, can be a sign of ongoing pregnancy. The patient should be asked whether she passed what appeared to be tissue and whether this passage of tissue coincided with several hours of severe cramps that decreased in severity after the tissue was passed.</p><p>A pelvic examination finding of a uterus that is firm and of nongravid size may be used for confirmation of complete abortion without the use of ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Signs and symptoms of an incomplete abortion include: ongoing cramping or bleeding, dilated cervix, uterus enlarged or unchanged from the initial examination.</p><p>On pelvic ultrasound, absence of a gestational sac is confirmation of a complete abortion.

On occasion, surgical intervention may be required to terminate the pregnancy if side effects are poorly tolerated (eg, severe pain or vomiting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Complications include hemorrhage, infection, incomplete abortion, and unrecognized ectopic pregnancy. Rare cases of fatal sepsis have occurred. In a study of over 200,000 medication abortion procedures, a significant adverse event occurred in 0.16 percent of cases, with emergency department treatment in 0.10 percent and hospital admission in 0.06 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain and cramps are experienced by nearly all women undergoing medication abortion. The pain is usually self-limited and typically is most severe shortly after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> is taken until the expulsion of the pregnancy. Many women require one or more medications for pain relief. Typically, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], but pain is relieved in some women only with opioids. Pain symptoms that are concerning for pelvic infection or other complications (eg, ectopic pregnancy) include: pain that increases in severity and frequency after the bleeding has begun to subside or a persistent pain sensation that is sharp or unilateral or otherwise not typical of menstrual-like cramps. Patients presenting with severe or atypical pain should be evaluated for infection, ectopic pregnancy and other possible causes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In theory, NSAIDs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, may potentially decrease the efficacy of medication abortion due to the antiprostaglandin properties of these drugs. However, in a study of medication abortion regarding this issue, NSAIDs did not interfere with the action of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> to induce uterine contractions and pregnancy expulsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In another study in women with gestations of 13 to 22 weeks, co-treatment with an NSAID and misoprostol did not interfere with the action of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> misoprostol to induce uterine contractions and pregnancy expulsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Heavy or prolonged bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal bleeding is common and typically heavier than a period, but not usually excessive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56315\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56315 \">figure 1</a>). In one study, the mean fall in hemoglobin was 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and fewer than 8 percent of patients had a loss exceeding 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

The perception among women is that the bleeding is more pronounced after medication abortion than after surgical abortion because of the duration, rather than the volume, of blood loss. Attempts to reduce the duration of bleeding by administration of an oral contraceptive or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> have been ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].</p><p>Blood loss usually is not severe enough to require therapy.

For patients with excessive or prolonged bleeding, incomplete abortion should be excluded. Retained products of conception should be suspected if bleeding persists for more than one week or if bleeding increases rather than decreases with time.</p><p>If retained products of conception are present, uterine aspiration should be performed. Patients should be evaluated for infection, since postabortal endometritis may result in continued bleeding. For other women, severe bleeding may be controlled with uterotonics or uterine packing. Fluid resuscitation or transfusion should be given as needed. It is rare for hemorrhage to be so severe or life-threatening that hysterectomy or uterine artery embolization would be indicated after first-trimester medication abortion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal discomfort</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are frequently reported adverse events and are associated with the prostaglandin component of the regimen.

Women describe approximately 20 percent of these gastrointestinal side effects as severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The incidence of gastrointestinal discomfort is higher with oral rather than vaginal or buccal administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> and with increase in duration of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Most women who receive a second dose of misoprostol for incomplete expulsion do expel the gestation, but the rate of expulsion after a second dose is much lower than after the first dose. Therefore, if urgent surgical intervention is not clinically warranted, women should be given the option of a second dose of misoprostol or surgical intervention after appropriate counseling. As an example, in a large case series, more than half of women expelled a retained gestational sac after receiving an additional vaginal dose of misoprostol; the few patients with persistent cardiac activity had a lower expulsion rate (5 of 14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1068566\"><span class=\"h3\">Teratogenicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, women choose to continue a pregnancy after a failed medication abortion or a continuing pregnancy is not recognized.

The malformations have included scalp or skull defects, cranial nerve palsies (Mobius syndrome), and limb deficiencies (eg, equinovarus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/86-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-89</a>]. The rise in uterine pressure related to uterine contractions or vascular spasm may be the mechanism contributing to these teratogenic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/86-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1068844\"><span class=\"h2\">Ectopic pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, ectopic pregnancy is diagnosed after receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a></span> for medication abortion.

Women with fever should be evaluated for localizing signs of infection, primarily endometritis.</p><p>Medication abortion does not involve instrumentation of the uterus and thus has a lower incidence of infection than surgical abortion. In surgical abortion, postabortal endometritis is thought to arise from the introduction of vaginal and skin flora into the endometrial cavity. The incidence of endometritis following medication abortion is lower than after surgical abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Gas gangrene was not noted. There should be a high index of suspicion of sepsis if these findings are present, and the patient should be evaluated and treated immediately. Optimal therapy is unproven, but probably includes surgical debridement, removal of infected organs (eg, hysterectomy), and antibiotics with good anaerobic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].
