Initially used as an anesthetic in Europe, GHB was found to have inadequate analgesic effects and significant side effects, including myoclonus and emergence delirium, and did not receive approval in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the 1980s GHB was marketed as a bodybuilding and weight loss drug and sold in health food stores. Recreational use of GHB subsequently became more widespread as GHB was abused at clubs, raves, and dance venues for euphoric, sexual, stimulant, and relaxant effects. </p><p>Following reports of adverse effects from and the enactment of government restrictions on GHB, gamma butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4 butanediol (BD), two common industrial solvents, became popular as &quot;dietary supplements&quot;, and were promoted for bodybuilding, weight loss, sleep, and in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and alcohol and drug dependence. Both GBL and BD are rapidly metabolized to GHB, with the same clinical effects. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology and cellular toxicology'</a> below.)</p><p>Adverse events from and subsequent regulation of GBL and BD &quot;supplements&quot; led to spurious sale of both compounds as &quot;non-toxic&quot; and &quot;organic&quot; solvents, &quot;cleaning products,&quot; and &quot;chemical samples&quot; to avoid detection and prosecution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These products were then replaced by industrial GBL and BD sold on the internet through unregulated companies in Asia and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Analog supplements, such as &quot;Potion 9,&quot; have also been spuriously marketed on the internet in recent years as &quot;mood enhancers,&quot; promoted primarily for prosexual effects, but with no disclosure of BD on product labels or websites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The toxicology and management of acute GHB intoxication are reviewed here. GHB withdrawal, GHB in the treatment of narcolepsy, the toxicology of other drugs of abuse that may be coingested, and general management of the poisoned patient are all discussed separately.

The pharmacology of GHB and its analogs are discussed in the text. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology and cellular toxicology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of GHB use among adults in the United States is unknown. GHB-associated emergency department (ED) presentations peaked at 5000 visits in 2000 but have declined since. In 2011, GHB-related ED visits numbered 2400; of these, approximately 50 percent were male and 85 percent were white [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As with many poisonings, these figures likely underestimate the incidence of GHB toxicity and GHB-associated adverse events. Data from Europe and Australia show that GHB use continues to have significant adverse effects on public health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/6-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-17</a>].</p><p>Although abuse of GHB and related drugs by the general population, remains low (generally less than 1 percent), targeted surveys indicate higher use among particular subgroups, including club and dance venue attendees and men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly in cities and certain localities in the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/14,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18-20</a>]. GHB poisoning may account for a disproportionate number of severe drug ingestions: 18 percent of drug-related emergencies reported in 2013 in the Netherlands involved GHB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. More than 50 percent of GHB-related emergencies in the Netherlands were documented as severe intoxications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and a 2011-2012 study of acute poisonings in Oslo, Norway, found GHB toxicity to be the factor most strongly associated with hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In the past, significant numbers of people used GHB, gamma butyrolactone (GBL), and 1,4 butanediol (BD) for bodybuilding and other purported health benefits. While misinformation about purported health benefits, particularly use for sleep, bodybuilding, depression, and anxiety remain on internet drug forums, chat rooms, quasi-medical articles, and recreational drug information websites, recreational use at social gatherings, clubs, bars, dance venues, and private homes now predominates. Polydrug use is common, with GHB frequently used with drugs such as MDMA (ecstasy), mephedrone, cocaine, and methamphetamine, as well as alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/8,9,12,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,12,21,22</a>]. Mass intoxications of recreational users at &quot;raves&quot; (dance parties) and clubs have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/9,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23</a>]. GHB use by MSM at clubs, circuit parties, and sex parties, particularly in conjunction with crystal methamphetamine, mephedrone, MDMA, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, is widely reported, often producing medical complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/21,24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24-29</a>]. </p><p>GHB-intoxicated driving has been widely documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/30-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-36</a>], and &quot;sleep driving&quot; has been reported in patients taking Xyrem for sleep disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Accidental ingestion has been reported in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/33,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,38</a>] and children (who may ingest GHB left unattended in homes and health clubs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>] or GBL solvents) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Acute toxicity in children who ingested BD-coated toy beads has been reported in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Surreptitious drugging with GHB, GBL, and Xyrem to facilitate sexual assault has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/45-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-50</a>]. Detection of GHB in cases of alleged assault is impeded by the lack of a rapid toxicology screen, the short half-life of GHB, amnestic effects, and delays in presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'GHB-facilitated sexual assault'</a> below.)</p><p>To date, there are more than 400 deaths associated with ingestion of illicit GHB, GBL, and BD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/14,33,34,45,52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,33,34,45,52-55</a>]. In the two largest published series (375 total deaths), approximately 35 percent of deaths did not involve cointoxicants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/14,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,33</a>]. GHB-related deaths associated with recreational use of &quot;novel psychoactive substances&quot; such as 3-Methylmethcathinone (3-MMC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>] and mephedrone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/14,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,57</a>] have been reported. GHB-associated deaths are likely under-detected and under-reported due to the lack of routine testing by hospitals and medical examiners, variable familiarity of medical examiners and coroners with GHB and its analogs, limited resources for testing, absence of billing codes for GHB as a cause of death, and lack of death registries. The detection of Xyrem-related fatalities is equally difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Lethality'</a> below.)</p><p>Internet websites, chat rooms, and forums have figured prominently in the provision of information, misinformation, and access to GHB, GBL, and BD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/2,6,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,59</a>]. Online access to GHB and other recreational drugs through cyber drug markets has increased dramatically in recent years with the advent of the &quot;Deep Web&quot; or &quot;Dark Net,&quot; which provides anonymous access to &quot;cryptomarkets&quot; such as Silk Road and its successors. GHB and other drugs also remain readily available through &quot;clear web&quot; sites for chemical companies, online pharmacies, and peer-to-peer marketplaces such as eBay, Craigslist, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GHB is a short-chain fatty acid that exists endogenously in mammalian tissue. It is a metabolite and precursor of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter. GHB interacts with GHB-specific receptors and also acts as a direct agonist of GABA-B receptors. In high doses it may exert additional GABA-like effects through conversion to GABA. GHB affects multiple neurotransmitter systems, including those of opioids, dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and acetylcholine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Gamma butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4 butanediol (BD) are GHB analogs that are rapidly metabolized to GHB after ingestion, with the same toxic and recreational effects. GBL is an endogenous lactone that is converted to GHB via a peripheral lactonase. Animal studies demonstrate GBL to have more rapid absorption, greater lipid solubility, higher serum concentrations, and more prolonged hypnotic effects than GHB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>BD is an endogenous aliphatic alcohol that is converted to gamma hydroxybutyraldehyde and subsequently to GHB by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, respectively. As with GBL, effects are mediated through GABA-B and GHB receptors. In contrast to GBL, which appears to exert effects solely through conversion to GHB, BD may exert toxic effects independent from its metabolism to GHB. Animal research also suggests potential interactions between BD and ethanol due to competition for alcohol dehydrogenase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">FORMULATIONS AND DOSING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Currently available formulations of GHB and related substances include industrial gamma butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4 butanediol (BD), illicit &quot;supplements,&quot; street supplies, home-synthesized GHB (made from recipes available on the internet), and pharmaceutical formulations. Current use of illicit GHB and analogs is primarily limited to liquid GHB and GBL. BD is also available in liquid form, but has been less commonly reported since the early 2000s. Liquid GHB is odorless and clear, with a salty or soapy taste. GBL and BD supplements and solvents reportedly have a chemical taste and may also have colorants, scents, and flavorings added. GHB has also been sold in powder form and GBL and BD have been sold in capsule form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Lists of GHB, GBL, and BD-containing products and slang terms are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52665\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52665 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Product concentrations vary widely, from undiluted GHB and industrial grade GBL and BD, to dilute GBL and BD supplement and solvent products; street doses are reported to vary from 500 mg to 5 g per teaspoon or capful dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Recreational doses of GHB (ie, for euphoric effects) are approximately 2.5 grams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>] but vary widely. Dependent users report the development of tolerance and may use up to 7 g per dose several times per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>GHB toxicity may be compounded by toxic contaminants or additives in GBL or BD-containing solvents, paint removers, and cleaners, as well as undissolved sodium hydroxide and other contaminants used in home-synthesized GHB.</p><p>GHB is used as a therapeutic agent in the United States and in Europe. In Europe, GHB is available as Xyrem (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium oxybate</a>) for the treatment of narcolepsy. Somsanit (an anesthetic), and Alcover (for treatment of alcohol and drug dependence). Alcover abuse, dependence, acute toxicity, and associated fatalities have been reported in Italy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/65-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-68</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the approval of Xyrem gives GHB a bifurcated Drug Enforcement Administration scheduling status: GHB used for illicit purposes is a Schedule I Controlled Substance, while pharmaceutical GHB used for therapeutic purposes is a Schedule III drug. Xyrem is distributed in the United States through a single central pharmacy with a risk management program. While postmarketing safety surveillance reports a low incidence of abuse or misuse of Xyrem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], cases of Xyrem <span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium oxybate</a></span> diversion, toxicity, dependence, and withdrawal have been documented, as well as Xyrem-associated sexual assault, impaired driving, and fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication/abstract/45,52,55,69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,52,55,69,70</a>].

Because GHB toxicity is clinically similar to ethanol intoxication, a serum ethanol level may be of use in differentiating the two. However, ethanol is a common coingestant. Further testing varies according to clinical presentation. As an example, creatine kinase and urine myoglobin should be obtained in patients at risk for rhabdomyolysis.

Throughout this review, we use the term &quot;GHB&quot; to refer to GHB and its analogs, unless specifically noted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway and breathing support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians must ensure airway patency with basic maneuvers (head-tilt, chin-lift, jaw thrust) and assist ventilation with bag-valve mask, supplemental oxygen, or tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, as necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Intubation and mechanical ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agitation may occur in response to intubation attempts. We suggest rapid sequence intubation (RSI) using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>, unless contraindications exist. Induction agents for RSI may not be necessary in patients already heavily sedated from GHB. Although the potential for hypotension from GHB toxicity theoretically makes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> a better induction agent than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, such hypotension is likely to be transient and clinically insignificant.

Close monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status is critical in all cases; the infrequency of intubation-related complications and the potentially life-threatening risk of respiratory depression and arrest must guide treatment decisions. We believe end-tidal CO2 monitoring can play an important and useful role in monitoring the ventilatory status of these patients.

Chemical restraint is much preferred, and physical restraints should be removed as soon as sedation is achieved. Appropriate monitoring is crucial, particularly while physical restraints are in place. Benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>) and antipsychotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">droperidol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>) may be used for sedation.

Charcoal should be withheld in patients who are sedated and may not be able to protect their airway, unless tracheal intubation is performed first. However, tracheal intubation should not be performed solely for the purpose of giving charcoal.
