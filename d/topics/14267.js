The acute management, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute management of nephrolithiasis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for nephrolithiasis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children and adolescents with nephrolithiasis, renal stones recur frequently. This was illustrated in a large case series of 221 children from the Mayo Clinic that demonstrated two-thirds of the patients developed one or more additional stones at a mean follow-up of 59 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other centers have reported a lower but still substantial recurrence rate of approximately 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The incidence of recurrent nephrolithiasis increases if there is an identified underlying metabolic abnormality that contributes to stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, we evaluate every child with nephrolithiasis for an underlying metabolic disorder that increases the risk of stone formation. If a metabolic abnormality is detected, we initiate medical therapy to correct the underlying problem. The rationale for our approach is based upon the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent stone disease frequently occurs in children and adolescents with nephrolithiasis. Children with an underlying metabolic abnormality are more likely to have recurrent stones. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several case series have demonstrated that over half of the children with nephrolithiasis will have an underlying metabolic abnormality that increases the risk of stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for nephrolithiasis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults, outcome data demonstrate that medical intervention reduces the rate of recurrent stone disease. Although similar data are not readily available for children, we believe these findings are directly applicable to the prevention of recurrent stones in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent episodes of nephrolithiasis are associated with pain, school absenteeism, loss of work hours for the parent(s), and clinical costs. In addition, there is evidence that recurrent stone disease may have long-term deleterious effects upon renal function. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Based upon these observations, prevention of recurrent stone disease should be a major clinical goal. Our practice of minimizing risk factors by identifying and correcting any metabolic abnormality associated with nephrolithiasis is, we believe, a reasonable approach in preventing recurrent disease in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR UNDERLYING RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the acute episode of stone passage or removal has ended, an evaluation is performed to determine whether there are underlying factors responsible for stone formation. Evaluation includes stone analysis, whenever possible, and an evaluation to detect any underlying metabolic disorder that promotes stone formation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Stone analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any stone that is retrieved should be sent to a laboratory with expertise in stone analysis to determine the stone composition. Knowing the composition of the stone can help focus the metabolic evaluation and guide therapeutic decisions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for nephrolithiasis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Preventive management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, all children with a renal stone should be evaluated for underlying metabolic disorders that increase the risk of stone formation. The metabolic evaluation should be performed while the patient is at home, fully ambulatory, consuming a regular diet, and free of infection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for nephrolithiasis in children&quot;, section on 'Overview of risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>If a stone has been retrieved and analyzed, the evaluation can be focused upon the specific components of the stone. As an example, in a child with calcium oxalate stones, evaluation may be limited to serum measurements of calcium, and urine measurements of oxalate, uric acid, and citrate because hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria, hyperoxaluria, and hypocitraturia are known risk factors for calcium oxalate stone formation. In this case, urinary measurement of cystine is not necessary.</p><p>If a stone is not retrieved, we perform a complete metabolic evaluation that consists of both serum and urine testing as discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Serum tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum testing includes measurements of calcium, phosphorus, bicarbonate, creatinine, magnesium, and uric acid.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient is hypercalcemic or hypophosphatemic, measurement of serum parathyroid hormone levels is required because primary hyperparathyroidism could be the cause of hypercalcemia and renal stones. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Clinical manifestations&quot;, section on 'Nephrolithiasis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of hypophosphatemia raises the possibility of an underlying genetic disorder, such as hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets and tumor-induced osteomalacia&quot;, section on 'Hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a low serum bicarbonate concentration raises the possibility of distal renal tubular acidosis as an underlying cause of nephrolithiasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrolithiasis in renal tubular acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of hypomagnesemia raises the possibility of an underlying genetic disorder, such as familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypomagnesemia#H8658123\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypomagnesemia&quot;, section on 'Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of hyperuricemia is seen in lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative disorders, or rare genetic disorders such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase deficiency), and glycogen storage diseases. However, nephrolithiasis is not generally a presenting finding in these disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Urine tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary abnormalities are best detected by measurements of urinary solute excretion from 24-hour urine collections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70589\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70589 \">table 1</a>). In many laboratories, two or three separate collections are required to obtain all the necessary measurements because different solutes will need to be collected and tested in separate solutions. As examples, uric acid is measured in an alkaline solution, calcium and oxalate in hydrochloric or nitric acid, and citrate in an acidified solution. Clinicians need to check with the clinical laboratory that will be performing the studies to obtain the correct containers and instructions for collection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-of-a-24-hour-urine-specimen-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Volume, creatinine, calcium, oxalate, uric acid, sodium and citrate are measured in the 24-hour collections. The measurement of creatinine excretion assesses the completeness of the 24-hour collection. The normal creatinine excretion rate varies by the ratio of lean body mass to total body mass of the individual, which is usually manifested by the age and gender of the patient. Composite normal 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion values based upon age for white children are listed in table 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80322\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80322 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Similar data for children of other ethnicities are lacking. Until such data exist, we have continued to use the above parameters in all children to check for completion of a 24-hour urine collection. Under collection can be inferred if the creatinine excretion is below the expected normative range and over collection if the creatinine excretion is above the expected normative range.</p><p>In some cases obtaining a 24-hour urine collection is difficult, especially in infants and small children who are not toilet trained. As a result, normative values based upon a single urine sample have been developed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82389\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82389 \">table 3</a>). Of note, in infants and small children, the solute to creatinine ratios are generally higher in random urine samples because of the lower creatinine excretion rates.</p><p>Several case series have documented metabolic urine abnormalities in approximately half of the evaluated children with nephrolithiasis. Specific metabolic findings and their frequency in children with an identifiable metabolic abnormality include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercalciuria &ndash; 50 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperoxaluria &ndash; 10 to 20 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperuricosuria &ndash; 2 to 8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystinuria &ndash; 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypocitraturia &ndash; 10 percent</p><p/><p>These metabolic abnormalities and their association with childhood nephrolithiasis are discussed in detail separately.

The presence of hexagonal cystine crystals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56834\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56834 \">picture 1</a>) is diagnostic of cystinuria, while the presence of phosphate crystals in the urine sediment when the urine pH is above 7 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F108401\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108401 \">picture 2</a>) is suggestive of calcium phosphate or struvite calculi.

In adults, clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of medical therapeutic interventions in reducing new stone formation in patients with underlying metabolic abnormalities. Although similar data are not available for children, we believe the evidence demonstrating beneficial results in adults are directly applicable to the prevention of recurrent stones in children.

High fluid intake increases the urine flow rate and lowers the urine solute concentration, thereby reducing the likelihood of new stone formation. Fluid intake is targeted to maintain the following 24-hour urine volumes based upon age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants &ndash; &ge;750 mL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small children below five years of age &ndash; &ge;1000 mL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children between 5 and 10 years of age &ndash; &ge;1500 mL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children greater than 10 years of age &ndash; &ge;2000 mL</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preventive interventions are targeted to correct specific metabolic abnormalities that increase the risk of stone formation.

Calcium restriction below the USRDA is not recommended because of the risk of osteopenia and secondary hyperoxaluria. However, calcium excess should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin D supplementation is avoided because elevated serum calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) levels can enhance urinary calcium excretion both by increasing intestinal calcium absorption (absorptive hypercalciuria) and by promoting bone resorption (resorptive hypercalciuria).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other measures include limiting animal protein intake to the USRDA, and ensuring adequate potassium intake, as potassium deficiency is associated with increased calcium excretion.</p><p/><p>Thiazide diuretics should be considered in a child or adolescent with recurrent calcium stones if dietary measures over a three to six month period fail to reduce urinary calcium levels. Thiazide diuretics (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorothiazide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorothiazide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>) enhance sodium and calcium reabsorption in the distal renal tubule leading to a reduction in urinary calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some patients may benefit from a combination of thiazide diuretics and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amiloride</a>, because amiloride increases calcium reabsorption in the cortical collecting tubule, further lowering calcium excretion. The use of thiazide diuretics in patients with hypercalciuria is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

The regimen consists of a high fluid intake, oral carbonate or citrate with meals to bind oxalate in the intestinal lumen, and if there is a high oxalate intake, lowering dietary oxalate intake. Oxalate rich foods include beet and turnip greens, rhubarb, strawberries, star fruit, sweet potatoes, wheat bran, tea, cocoa, pepper, chocolate, parsley, beets, spinach, dill, nuts, and citrus juices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Excessive consumption of vitamin C can lead to hyperoxaluria because Vitamin C is metabolized to oxalate.</p><p>Other therapeutic options, which are generally required for children with secondary hyperabsorption of oxalate due to fat malabsorption include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-fat diet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain an adequate calcium intake (USRDA).

The first and initial therapy used in any child with hyperuricosuria is increased fluid intake to maintain a targeted 24-hour urine volume based upon the age of the child as previously discussed.</p><p>The other two measures for those refractory to increased fluid intake include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alkalinization of the urine with administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-citrate-and-citric-acid-powder-or-solution-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">potassium citrate-citric acid</a> or potassium bicarbonate, which increases the solubility of uric acid. Alkalinization prevents uric acid precipitation and, in some cases, can lead to dissolution of uric acid crystals and stones. Potassium bicarbonate or potassium citrate-citric acid is the preferred therapy for urinary alkalization, as the administration of sodium salt (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium bicarbonate</a>) induces volume expansion. This increases sodium, and secondarily, calcium excretion resulting in hypercalciuria, which promotes stone formation. The sodium-induced volume expansion increases sodium and secondarily calcium excretion resulting in hypercalciuria, which increases the risk of stone formation.

A complete evaluation of the kidney and urinary tract should also be performed because these children have an increase risk for renal and urinary tract abnormalities that predisposes them to infection and stone formation. Both the evaluation and management of recurrent urinary tract infection and the evaluation of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract are reviewed separately.

Nevertheless, both herbal and acupuncture therapies have commanded widespread interest and use, especially in Asian countries. We do not recommend these therapies as they remain unproven. This discussion is to provide information on what complementary and alternate therapies are being used. </p><p>Most of the herbal agents used in treating nephrolithiasis are believed to have mild diuretic effects, which may reduce stone formation by increasing urinary flow and volume. Chocolate vine (Mu Tong, Akebia quinata) and Centella asiatica (gotu kola) are traditional Chinese medicine. Kamala (Mallotus philippinensis) and cumin (Cuminum cyminum) are popular treatments in India, although cumin may be of concern in pregnancy because it also is used to induce abortion. Other plants include cleavers (Galium aparine) and burdock (Arctium lappa).</p><p>Aloe vera and yellow dock (Rumex crispus) contain calcium binders that reduce crystal growth rate, but the high levels of oxalate in yellow dock may negate any beneficial effect.</p><p>Acupuncture and acupressure are used to treat nephrolithiasis in China.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring includes imaging to detect new stone formation or increasing size of previous stones, and laboratory evaluation to assess the response to preventive medical therapy.</p><p>The frequency and degree of monitoring in children with nephrolithiasis depends upon the type of stone, the number of stones and recurrence rate, and the presence and severity of any metabolic abnormality. As an example, a child with multiple stones and a significant metabolic problem, such as primary hyperoxaluria or cystinuria, is at greater risk for recurrent nephrolithiasis than a child with a single stone and no evidence of an underlying metabolic abnormality. In the child with a high-risk of recurrent stones, more frequent and intensive monitoring is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, ultrasonography is generally used to monitor for new stone formation and change in size of previous stones. Although non-contrast helical computed tomography (CT) is the most sensitive imaging modality in the detection of renal stones, the higher radiation, especially in small children, and cost compared with ultrasonography limits its use in routine follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The frequency of imaging is dependent upon the type and number of stones, and the presence and severity of any underlying metabolic abnormality. In most circumstances and in the absence of symptoms or infections, an examination is performed one year after the initial episode. If the study demonstrates no stone recurrence or change in residual stone size, the study can be performed every other year.</p><p>Acute symptoms should prompt reevaluation. In this setting, the choice of imaging modality is based upon the clinical circumstances and the availability of appropriate equipment and the expertise of the personnel. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in children&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If preventive measures are initiated to correct a metabolic abnormality, subsequent laboratory assessment to evaluate the impact of the intervention is required. In general, we obtain the appropriate studies at six to eight weeks after therapy has begun. If the intervention has successfully corrected the metabolic abnormality, repeat values are obtained at six months, and then at a yearly or every two-year interval. If biochemical abnormalities persist, additional adjustment of the metabolic intervention is required and a subsequent evaluation is needed.</p><p>If it is difficult to obtain a 24-hour urine collection, random spot urine samples can be obtained.</p><p>Monitoring the specific gravity of the urinalysis is useful in determining whether increased fluid intake has resulted in a dilute urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent stone disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, there are limited data comparing the effects of metabolic intervention to conservative therapy of increased fluid intake on the rate of stone recurrence. Data that do exist primarily involve children with severe metabolic abnormalities and nephrolithiasis, such as cystinuria and primary hyperoxaluria.</p><p>As discussed above, in adults there is evidence that dietary measures and some pharmacologic agents decrease recurrent stone formation in patients with the more common metabolic abnormalities of hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, and hypocitraturia.

Volume, creatinine, calcium, oxalate, uric acid, sodium, and citrate are measured in the 24-hour collection. In some cases, obtaining a 24-hour urine collection is difficult, especially in infants and small children who are not toilet trained. As a result, normative values based upon a single urine sample have been developed and complement the age-based standard values for a 24-hour urine collection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70589\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70589 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82389\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82389 \">table 3</a>).

We suggest adding thiazide diuretic therapy to a child or adolescent with recurrent calcium stones if dietary measures over a three to six month period fail to reduce urinary calcium levels.
