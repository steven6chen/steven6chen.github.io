However, some additional factors need to be considered in pregnancy, including changes in susceptibility to infection, changes in maternal physiology, and the effect of the infection and its treatment on the fetus. </p><p>This topic review will discuss issues specific to respiratory infections in the setting of pregnancy. Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of respiratory infections in the general population are reviewed separately (refer to individual topic reviews).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Awareness of pregnancy-associated changes in respiratory physiology is important to the management of respiratory disease in pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59101\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59101 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80850 \">figure 2</a>). Such changes allow the pregnant woman to meet the metabolic needs of her fetus and are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Physiologic respiratory changes and dyspnea&quot;, section on 'Respiratory changes'</a>.)</p><p>Important points to consider when evaluating pregnant women with respiratory illness include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although pregnant women often experience dyspnea, tachypnea is not normal. The respiratory system adapts to increased needs largely by an increase in tidal volume without an increase in respiratory rate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Physiologic respiratory changes and dyspnea&quot;, section on 'Respiratory changes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy is a state of mild respiratory alkalosis related to alveolar hyperventilation. Normal third trimester arterial blood gas levels are approximately pH 7.39 to 7.45, PC0<sub>2</sub> 25 to 33 mmHg, PO<sub>2</sub> 92 to 107 mmHg, and bicarbonate 16 to 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.

As a result, an apneic pregnant woman will develop hypoxia and acidosis more quickly than a nonpregnant woman. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Physiologic respiratory changes and dyspnea&quot;, section on 'Respiratory changes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women are prone to acute pulmonary edema related to pre-existing conditions (eg, cardiovascular disease), pregnancy complications (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia,</span> peripartum cardiomyopathy, multiple gestation, amniotic fluid embolism, pyelonephritis), drugs for treatment of preterm labor (eg, beta-adrenergic tocolytic agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a>, corticosteroids), and iatrogenic intravenous volume overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women are prone to aspiration pneumonia because of decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone and increased intraabdominal pressure associated with the gravid state.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-failure-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory failure during pregnancy and the peripartum period&quot;, section on 'Aspiration'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Theoretically, pregnancy-related alterations in cell mediated immunity may increase the risk and severity of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal mortality and stillbirth have been reported among pregnant women with severe respiratory infections caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and other infections causing pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most acute respiratory tract infections, which include acute uncomplicated bronchitis, pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, and the common cold, are caused by viruses and do not warrant antibiotic therapy. The use of unwarranted antibiotic therapy in such cases is an important contributor to antibiotic resistance, medication-related adverse events, and unnecessary cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Antibiotic stewardship plays an important role in controlling rates of clostridium difficile infection, which is associated with significant maternal morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11616732\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general approach to caring for pregnant women with respiratory illness is to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine the appropriate clinical evaluation and treatment. The initial approach to evaluating a pregnant woman with respiratory illness is similar to that of a nonpregnant patient and includes a complete history, physical examination, and differential diagnosis. Tachycardia, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturation are not normal physiologic changes in pregnancy, thus the presence of these, or other abnormal lung findings such as rales or other signs of consolidation, are indicative of an underlying disease process that requires further investigation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine whether implementing this diagnostic and therapeutic plan carries any additional risks for the pregnant patient or fetus. These additional risks may be related to increased maternal susceptibility to severe disease or complications in pregnancy (eg, influenza) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to potential fetal risks related to the disease, its evaluation, or its treatment (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> may stain developing teeth). If so, are there alternative investigations or treatments that reduce or eliminate these risks? What are the risks in not implementing this plan in the pregnant patient? </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTED DISORDERS AND TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">The common cold</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in nonpregnant patients, symptoms related to the common cold are usually mild and self-limited, and generally do not require or respond well to intervention. However, many pregnant women with the common cold will seek advice and symptomatic therapy from their clinician. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-diagnosis-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Diagnosis and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women with the common cold can be reassured that their symptoms will generally resolve within 10 days, although the cough may linger longer. Drug therapy may relieve some symptoms; however, treatment does not shorten the duration of symptoms and the risks of drug therapy for the common cold in pregnancy have not been studied in randomized trials. If the patient still seeks symptomatic relief after being informed of the self-limited nature of the illness, the limited efficacy of all available treatments, and the absence of strong evidence of safety, she should be steered towards those agents with the best evidence of no harm to the fetus. Data about the safety and efficacy of several drugs used to treat the common cold are provided in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62846%7EOBGYN%2F75622%7EOBGYN%2F51533%7EOBGYN%2F77865\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62846 graphicRef75622 graphicRef51533 graphicRef77865 \">table 1A-D</a>).</p><p>In general, use of heated humidified air for congestion and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> for sore throat and headache offer the best balance of safety and efficacy. A large epidemiologic study (National Birth Defects Prevention Study, 1997&ndash;2011) described an association between maternal report of cold or flu with fever in early pregnancy and birth defects, but no association in similar women without fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although fever may be a marker for more severe <span class=\"nowrap\">cold/flu</span> or other differences between the groups, the possibility of a causal association cannot be excluded. In addition, a case control study reported an association between use of acetaminophen and decreased risk of some congenital abnormalities related to maternal hyperthermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Therefore, if fever is present, it is reasonable to suggest use of acetaminophen to relieve discomfort from fever, and it may have additional benefits. The safety of acetaminophen is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs#H3549174783\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Patient education, health promotion, and safety of commonly used drugs&quot;, section on 'Acetaminophen'</a>.)</p><p>Limited data from two epidemiologic studies in humans and a study in rats did not show an increased risk of teratogenesis from maternal use of throat lozenges made from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetylpyridinium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetylpyridinium</a> chloride (eg, Cepacol); no data are available on the teratogenic risk of most other over-the-counter agents for relief of cold symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>For patients with severe rhinorrhea, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> bromide nasal spray is an option; animal studies have not observed teratogenic effects, but there are no human data. The 0.06 percent ipratropium bromide nasal spray is typically administered as two 42 mcg sprays to each nostril three to four times a day. Other options for patients with severe cold symptoms include intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> sodium or cough suppression with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dextromethorphan</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guaifenesin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guaifenesin</a>. Inhaled cromolyn preparations may cause transient bronchospasm, throat irritation, and cough; caution is warranted in asthmatics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;, section on 'Intranasal/inhaled cromolyn sodium'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention#H2530680479\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;, section on 'Dextromethorphan'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention#H1006178088\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;, section on 'Intranasal ipratropium bromide'</a>.)</p><p>Antibiotics are not indicated for treatment of the common cold, except in the small subset of patients (less than 2 percent) with evidence of secondary bacterial sinus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Sinusitis'</a> below). The pregnant state does not change the usual standards for administering or withholding antibiotics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention#H2092349229\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11799327\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute bronchitis is characterized by self-limited inflammation of the bronchi, which is clinically expressed as cough, usually with sputum production. Acute bronchitis cannot be distinguished from the common cold in the first few days of illness, but acute bronchitis should be considered when cough persists for more than five days. The absence of abnormalities on chest radiography distinguishes acute bronchitis from pneumonitis. Febrile patients are more likely to have influenza or pneumonia than bronchitis or the common cold. A chest radiograph should generally be performed when there are findings suggestive of pneumonia, such as tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, fever, rales, or evidence of consolidation on exam. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bronchitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bronchitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bronchitis is caused by a virus in approximately 90 percent of cases. Etiologic agents include influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus 3, coronavirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Purulent sputum is reported in 50 percent of patients with acute bronchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This usually represents sloughing of cells from the tracheobronchial epithelium, along with inflammatory cells. Purulence and sputum discoloration do <strong>not</strong>&nbsp;signify bacterial infection. Occasional patients have acute bronchitis caused by M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae or, increasingly, Bordetella pertussis. These etiologies should be suspected in patients with prolonged cough, even in the absence of the classic posttussive emesis, cough paroxysms, or inspiratory whoop seen in children with pertussis. In general, testing or empiric treatment for these pathogens is not recommended unless there is evidence of a local outbreak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumonia caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pertussis infection in adolescents and adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptomatic treatment is the same as for the common cold (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'The common cold'</a> above). Antibiotic therapy of viral bronchitis is not beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some patients experience symptomatic relief from cough with use of a steam humidifier. Since cough suppressants are not generally useful for treatment of the cough associated with bronchitis, pregnant women should be discouraged from using such agents. Supportive care and reassurance are the preferred treatment measures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Sinusitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women with the common cold are at increased risk of developing rhinosinusitis and Eustachian tube dysfunction, which has been attributed to congestion from hormonal effects on the nasal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Almost all rhinosinusitis is due to viruses; only a small fraction develop secondary bacterial infection. Uncomplicated acute viral rhinosinusitis typically resolves in 7 to 10 days. Many gravidas with documented rhinosinusitis do not have classic historical and physical findings, which include nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, maxillary tooth discomfort, hyposmia, and facial pain or pressure that is worse when bending forward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Despite the increased risk and the increased likelihood of atypical presentations, there are no distinct recommendations for distinguishing the common cold from bacterial rhinosinusitis in pregnant women. Therefore, we use the following criteria to diagnose acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, which are supported by the guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Persistent </strong>symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis lasting 10 or more days without evidence of clinical improvement.

As an example, imaging studies are indicated in patients with clinical signs or symptoms of complicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, including diminished visual acuity, diplopia, periorbital edema, severe headache, or altered mental status. If imaging is necessary, sinus radiographs are usually obtained initially in order to avoid the higher doses of radiation associated with computed tomography (CT). CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are usually reserved for complicated cases. Ultrasonography is not a good substitute because of variable performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute sinusitis and rhinosinusitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We suggest observation (watchful waiting) with symptomatic management for immunocompetent pregnant women with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis who have good follow-up (assurance that antibiotic therapy can be started if the patient does not improve or worsens) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F106157\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106157 \">algorithm 1</a>). This approach is similar to that from a multidisciplinary expert panel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and differs from the 2012 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, which prefer prompt initiation of antibiotics with an option to withhold therapy for three days in patients with mild symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Antibiotics should be started after diagnosis for patients who do not have good follow-up and in patients who have been managed with observation and have worsening symptoms. Patients with stable symptoms (no worsening or improvement) after seven days may be managed either with an additional 10 days of observation and symptomatic management or antibiotic therapy, depending on patient presentation, comorbidities, and social factors. Patients with worsening symptoms or who fail to improve with an additional 10 days of watchful waiting should be started on antibiotics. As in nonpregnant individuals, antibiotics for acute bacterial sinusitis are directed against the most likely pathogens, including <em>H. influenzae</em>, <em>M. catarrhalis</em>, and <em>S. pneumoniae</em>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amoxicillin</a> clavulanate (either 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/125</span> mg orally three times per day or 875 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/125</span> mg orally twice a day) is the preferred agent for treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in patients who are not allergic to penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and have no risk factors for resistance (eg, antibiotic use in the past month, multiple comorbidities, severe infection, area with &gt;10 percent <em>S. pneumoniae</em> penicillin resistance, immunocompromise). In patients with risk factors, high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/125</span> mg twice daily is suggested. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> plus an oral cephalosporin can be prescribed for patients with a non-type I hypersensitivity to penicillin. While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> remains a safe alternative agent for pregnant women, it may be less effective because of increasing rates of macrolide-resistant <em>S. pneumoniae. </em>Fluoroquinolones, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> are generally <strong>avoided in pregnancy</strong> because of potential effects on fetal cartilage, bones, and teeth.

This range is likely related to differences in the patient populations studied, as well as the availability and state of medical care at the time of the study. </p><p>Pneumonia accounted for 30 percent of concurrent infections diagnosed in pregnant women with severe sepsis in the United States (1998 to 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]). It is associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidities, but death of pregnant women is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/2,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,23-26</a>]. Risk factors for pneumonia in pregnancy include anemia, asthma, smoking, illicit drug use, and immunosuppressive illness (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS)</span> or immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>The classic symptoms of pneumonia are sudden onset of rigors followed by fever, pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and cough productive of purulent sputum; however, most patients do not present with classic symptoms. The clinical manifestations of pneumonia and the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected pneumonia are similar to those in nonpregnant individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A chest radiograph is required to diagnose pneumonia and should never be withheld from a pregnant woman in whom this diagnosis is suspected. The indications for obtaining a chest radiograph (posteroanterior and lateral views) in pregnancy are the same as in nonpregnant patients and include shortness of breath <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cough in association with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, decreased oxygen saturation, or rales or signs of consolidation on lung exam. The estimated fetal absorption for the chest radiographs is &lt;0.01 mGy (&lt;0.001 rad); this dose is well below doses that have been associated with any short- or long-term adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The abdomen should be shielded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Lung ultrasound is emerging as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in the emergency room and intensive care unit (ICU). Currently, there are no recommendations for use of ultrasound instead of diagnostic chest radiograph in nonpregnant patients; therefore, while it may be an additional tool to consider in specific circumstances where there is local expertise, more research is needed about its diagnostic use in pregnancy. The chest radiograph currently remains the gold standard for diagnosis of pneumonia in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>].</p><p>Pregnant women with pneumonia are prone to preterm labor and delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], as well as pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. While there does not appear to be an increase in perinatal mortality, the frequency of low birth weight infants born to mothers with pneumonia is higher than among controls without pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Pregnant women may be predisposed to a severe pneumonia course because of physiologic changes of pregnancy, including elevation of the diaphragm by up to 4 cm, decrease in functional residual capacity, increase in oxygen consumption, and increase in lung water. These changes make the pregnant woman less able to tolerate even brief periods of hypoxia. In addition, tachypnea can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces uterine blood flow. Given these factors, these authors have a low threshold to admit pregnant women with pneumonia to the hospital, where they can receive intravenous hydration, supplemental oxygen, and close maternal-fetal monitoring until there is clinical improvement.</p><p>While most pregnant women with pneumonia can be managed initially on the general ward or labor and delivery unit, intensive care unit admission is needed for those requiring mechanical ventilation or with septic shock. The severe spectrum of illness is suggested by respiratory rate &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/minute,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">PaO2/FiO2</span> ratio &lt;250, multilobar infiltrates, <span class=\"nowrap\">confusion/disorientation,</span> uremia (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] level &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> leukopenia (white blood cell count &lt;4000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>),</span> thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>),</span> hypothermia (core temperature &lt;36&deg;C), hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation, hypoglycemia (in nondiabetic patients), hyponatremia, or unexplained metabolic acidosis or elevated lactate level (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: Assessing severity and determining the appropriate site of care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=critical-illness-during-pregnancy-and-the-peripartum-period#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Critical illness during pregnancy and the peripartum period&quot;, section on 'Mechanical ventilation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;</a>). The decision to admit a pregnant woman with features of severe illness to the intensive care unit is complex, as most hospitals do not have an obstetric ICU. Discussions regarding the best place in the hospital to manage the sick pregnant woman with pneumonia need to include the input of the obstetrician and intensivist.</p><p>Fever should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and fluid status should be monitored closely since pregnant women are prone to pulmonary edema. Maternal oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) should be maintained at &ge;95 percent during pregnancy, which is necessary to maintain adequate fetal oxygenation. If SaO<sub>2</sub> falls below 95 percent, an arterial blood gas is obtained to measure PaO2. Maternal PaO<sub>2</sub> &ge;70 mmHg is desirable to maintain a favorable oxygen diffusion gradient from the maternal to the fetal side of the placenta.</p><p>The table summarizes major points in treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53414\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53414 \">table 2</a>).
