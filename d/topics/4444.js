Affected neonates usually present in the first few hours of life with respiratory distress that may be mild or so severe as to be incompatible with life. With the advent of antenatal diagnosis and improvement of neonatal care, survival has improved, but there still remains significant risk of death and complications in infants with CDH.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of the neonate with CDH will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, anatomy, incidence, and prenatal diagnosis and management of CDH are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Prenatal diagnosis and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4892796\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT ON PULMONARY DEVELOPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because herniation occurs during a critical period of lung development, clinical manifestations of CDH result from the pathologic effects of the herniated viscera on lung development. With rising severity of lung compression, there are corresponding decreases in bronchial and pulmonary arterial branching, resulting in increasing degrees of pulmonary hypoplasia. Pulmonary hypoplasia is most severe on the ipsilateral side. However, pulmonary hypoplasia may develop on the contralateral side if the mediastinum shifts and compresses the lung. Arterial branching is reduced, resulting in muscular hyperplasia of the pulmonary arterial tree, which contributes to the increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-in-the-neonate/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4885911\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although routine prenatal ultrasound screening may identify CDH at a mean gestational age (GA) of 24 weeks, there is a wide range of reported sensitivity in its detection. Associated other anomalies (eg, cardiac abnormalities) are seen in approximately 50 percent of CDH cases, and their presence improves the sensitivity of detecting CDH. Prenatal presentation and diagnosis are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Prenatal diagnosis and management&quot;, section on 'Prenatal diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4885917\"><span class=\"h2\">Postnatal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postnatally, infants with CDH most often present with respiratory distress in the first few hours or days of life. The spectrum can vary from the more common presentation of acute respiratory distress at birth, to minimal or no symptoms, which is observed in a much smaller group of patients who present later in life. (See <a href=\"#H48600457\" class=\"local\">'Late CDH presentation'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients who present as neonates, the degree of respiratory distress is dependent on the severity of lung hypoplasia and the development of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Postdelivery, hypoxemia and acidosis increase the risk of PPHN by inducing a reactive vasoconstrictive element to the preexisting fixed arterial muscular hyperplasia component. In some cases, pulmonary hypoplasia is so severe as to be incompatible with life. (See <a href=\"#H4892796\" class=\"local\">'Effect on pulmonary development'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most cases of CDH, herniation occurs on the left. Right-sided diaphragmatic hernias occur in approximately 15 percent of cases and bilateral herniation in 1 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-in-the-neonate/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Although there is no difference in mortality between left- and right-sided lesions, there may be a higher incidence of pulmonary complications associated with right- versus left-sided CDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-in-the-neonate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Bilateral herniation is associated with a high mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-in-the-neonate/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Adrenal insufficiency is reported to be a common finding in infants with CDH. In one retrospective study of 58 patients, adrenal insufficiency (defined as a cortisol level &le;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [415 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> was demonstrated in two-thirds of the 34 patients who were assessed for adrenal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-in-the-neonate/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this study, infants with adrenal insufficiency were more likely to have herniation of the liver, and had more severe illness requiring <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> for vasopressor support, high-frequency ventilation (HFV), and longer duration of inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitric oxide</a> (iNO) therapy. In our practice, we may administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> therapy in severely ill patients with hypotension because of the concern for adrenal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-term complications of the preterm infant&quot;, section on 'Low blood pressure'</a>.)</p><p>Associated anomalies are seen in approximately 50 percent of CDH cases and include chromosomal abnormalities, congenital heart disease, and neural tube defects.

The diagnosis is made by chest radiography showing herniation of abdominal contents (usually air- or fluid-containing bowel) into the hemithorax with little or no visible aerated lung on the affected side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52913\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52913 \">image 1</a>). Other radiographic findings include the contralateral displacement of mediastinal structures (eg, heart), compression of the contralateral lung, and reduced size of the abdomen with decreased or absent air-containing intra-abdominal bowel. The diagnosis may be facilitated by placement of a feeding tube, as chest radiography may show the feeding tube within the thoracic cavity or deviation from its expected anatomic course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-in-the-neonate/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In addition, head ultrasounds are performed emergently for onset of seizures, change in neurologic status, or following any significant clinical event (eg, surgical repair of CDH, and episodes of hypotension or hypertension).

With increased compression of the developing lung by the herniated abdominal contents, there are corresponding decreases in bronchial and pulmonary arterial branching, resulting in increasing degrees of lung hypoplasia and pulmonary arterial muscle hyperplasia (pulmonary hypertension). (See <a href=\"#H4892796\" class=\"local\">'Effect on pulmonary development'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CDH most often develop respiratory distress in the first few hours or days of life. The spectrum of presentation can vary from acute, severe respiratory distress at birth, which is common, to minimal to no symptoms, which is observed in a much smaller group of patients. Physical examination will reveal a barrel-shaped chest, a scaphoid-appearing abdomen because of loss of the abdominal contents into the chest, and the absence of breath sounds on the ipsilateral side. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis can be made prenatally with ultrasound examination. Among infants in whom CDH is not diagnosed in utero, the diagnosis is made by chest radiography showing herniation of abdominal contents.
