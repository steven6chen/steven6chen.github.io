As a result, patients with MDS are at risk for symptomatic anemia, infection, and bleeding, as well as progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is often refractory to treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with MDS, particularly those with lower risk disease, die because of the consequences of bone marrow failure rather than transformation to AML. Thus, use of terms such as &quot;pre-leukemia&quot; or &quot;smoldering leukemia&quot; can be misleading if taken to imply that death or morbidity from MDS results only when AML develops. Indeed, the distinction between MDS and AML is itself arbitrary, as patients with 20 to 30 percent blasts are considered to have MDS by French-American-British (FAB) criteria, but AML by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. </p><p>For many years, transfusion with packed red blood cells and platelets and the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents were the only therapy available. More recently, chemotherapy agents directed at the underlying disorder have been developed and continue to be studied for patients with MDS (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>). However, due to the advanced age of most patients, the chronicity of the disease, and its attendant morbidities, supportive care remains a central component of the management of all patients with MDS. Patients should be treated as needed with antibiotics for infection and platelet transfusions for bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the complications of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A general overview of the treatment of MDS will be reviewed here.

Some physicians may choose to intervene in cases of asymptomatic severe anemia (eg, hemoglobin &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> or asymptomatic severe thrombocytopenia (eg, platelets <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;10,000/microL)</span>. It is unclear that the treatment of neutropenia without a history of infection is of benefit. Studies of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in this setting have demonstrated that these agents can increase neutrophil counts, but do not improve clinically significant endpoints such as infection rates and survival. This is discussed in more detail separately.

This also allows for the more detailed evaluation of cytopenias and exclusion of reversible causes of the cytopenias (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> deficiency, iron deficiency, copper deficiency). This is also an opportunity to bring vaccinations up to date, especially against respiratory pathogens such as pneumococcus, haemophilus influenza B, pertussis, and influenza. Smoking cessation should also be emphasized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H7193969\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the complications of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Anemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H1063596\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the complications of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Vaccination'</a>.)</p><p>Most patients present with a history of documented complete blood counts, which can provide insight into the disease tempo. Less commonly, a patient with little information regarding prior blood counts should be initially scheduled for monthly visits. At these visits, we perform a focused history and physical examination, complete blood count with differential, and evaluate the peripheral blood smear. If the patient remains asymptomatic for several months and the blood counts are stable, the length of time between visits is gradually lengthened. Patients are educated regarding the potential complications of MDS and told to call the office immediately if they develop a fever or bleeding. When patients develop a transfusion requirement or recurrent infections, then it is time to consider treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516641\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with MDS should have a history and physical examination that includes documentation of their transfusion history. In addition, it is our practice to perform the following pretreatment studies in patients with MDS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, reticulocyte count, pre-transfusion serum erythropoietin level, RBC folate, serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> level, serum ferritin, iron, total iron binding capacity, serum copper level, and serology for HIV infection. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing should be performed for patients who are candidates for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and for those who require HLA-matched platelets. HLA-DR15 typing may identify patients with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS likely to respond to immunosuppressive agents.

This sample should be sent for pathologic review with iron staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to evaluate for common cytogenetic abnormalities in MDS and those that might affect therapy such as 5q minus, 7q minus, +8, MLL (11q23) rearrangements, 13q minus, 20q minus, and inv(3). Although FISH is often performed, it is unclear whether an abnormality detected only on FISH has the same significance as the same abnormality detected on routine cytogenetics.

Our treatment approach is similar to that proposed by the MDS Panel for Practice Guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), British Committee for Standards in Haematology, European Society of Medical Oncology, and the European LeukemiaNet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. This approach incorporates knowledge of the patient's performance status, the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85832 \">table 3</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-revised-international-prognostic-scoring-system-ipss-r-in-myelodysplastic-syndrome\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) MDS risk category, and other disease characteristics (ie, symptoms, cytopenias present, serum erythropoietin level) to help guide management decisions. However, despite the increased availability of treatment guidelines, it is important to individualize care for the patient with MDS.</p><p>Treatment options for patients with MDS typically fall into one of three categories: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive care includes the use of antibiotics for infection and red cell and platelet transfusions in the setting of symptomatic anemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Prophylactic antibiotics are generally not helpful and this strategy may select for antibiotic resistance. Supportive care is an important adjunct to the management of all patients with MDS and can be considered as the sole treatment modality for a subset of patients with lower risk MDS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-complications-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the complications of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low intensity therapies include hematopoietic growth factors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a> (often referred to as hypomethylating agents), immunosuppressive therapy, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>. These can be administered in the outpatient setting and have a low risk of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Low intensity treatments can improve symptoms and quality of life, but are not curative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High intensity therapies include intensive combination chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). They require hospitalization and entail significant risk of treatment-related mortality. However, these treatments may improve blood counts more quickly than less intensive therapy, reduce the risk of death from MDS, and may alter the MDS disease course. As in AML, combinations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daunorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daunorubicin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> should be reserved for patients with normal cytogenetics and de novo MDS. Use of combination chemotherapy in other patients, particularly those with unfavorable cytogenetics should be restricted to investigational regimens being studied in clinical trials. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>High intensity therapies are generally reserved for patients with intermediate-2 or high risk IPSS scores. This allows for the avoidance of treatment-related morbidity and mortality in most patients with a relatively good prognosis, and allows for the aggressive treatment of disease in those with a poor prognosis. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a very low (&le;1.5 points) or low (&gt;1.5 to 3 points) IPSS-R score are primarily treated with supportive care or low intensity therapies such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a> or immunosuppressive therapy.

A choice among these options is discussed in more detail separately.

In addition, patients with 5q deletion and those with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia demonstrating a platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) fusion gene have superior outcomes when treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, respectively.

Although transformation to AML is less frequent than bone marrow failure as a cause of death in MDS, significant numbers of patients with MDS undergo evolution to a form of AML which is often less responsive to standard treatment than is de novo AML. Advanced age makes these patients less likely to tolerate standard combination chemotherapy with or without hematopoietic cell transplantation. The adverse biologic characteristics of the transformed cells are also a major contributor to this poor prognosis.

Patients who achieve a CR have improved survival. This survival advantage appears to be due to the achievement of a CR rather than an inherently better prognosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial remission &ndash; Criteria for complete remission except bone marrow blasts decreased by &ge;50 percent over pretreatment, but are still &gt;5 percent. The cellularity and morphology of the bone marrow is not relevant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marrow complete remission &ndash; Marrow complete remission was developed to describe patients who have achieved a complete remission in the bone marrow, but have not recovered peripheral blood counts. The bone marrow demonstrates &le;5 percent myeloblasts and the percent of myeloblasts has decreased by &ge;50 percent over pretreatment. If peripheral blood demonstrates a hematologic improvement response, this should be noted in addition to marrow complete remission. As with hematologic improvement, the clinical significance of response marrow complete remission is not well established.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stable disease &ndash; Failure to achieve at least partial remission, but no evidence of progression for at least eight weeks. As with hematologic improvement, the clinical significance of stable disease is not well established.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease progression &ndash; Defined by the percent blasts: those with &lt;5 percent blasts have a &ge;50 percent increase in blasts to &gt;5 percent blasts; those with 5 to 10 percent blasts have a &ge;50 percent increase in blasts to &gt;10 percent; those with 10 to 20 percent blasts have a &ge;50 percent increase to &gt;20 percent; those with 10 to 30 percent blasts have a &ge;50 percent increase to &gt;30 percent. Disease progression can also be defined by an at least 50 percent decrement from maximum <span class=\"nowrap\">remission/response</span> in granulocytes or platelets, reduction in hemoglobin by &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> or transfusion dependence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytogenetic response &ndash; Complete if the previous chromosomal abnormality disappears without the appearance of new ones, partial if there is an at least 50 percent reduction in the chromosomal abnormality. At least 20 analyzable metaphases by conventional cytogenetic studies are required to diagnose or exclude the presence of any cytogenetic abnormality. Patients who achieve a CR but have persistent cytogenetic abnormalities are more likely to relapse than patients whose CR is characterized by disappearance of the initial cytogenetic abnormality.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H515607\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most treatment regimens are often continued until disease progression. However, it is not clear that continuous cycles of therapy lead to a better long-term outcome than stopping treatment after several months in CR and then resuming when the disease recurs. Second responses to the same drug do occur. Disease progression is characterized by worsening cytopenias, an increase in the percentage of bone marrow blasts, or progression to a more advanced MDS French-American-British (FAB) subtype. Progression is categorized according to the International Working Group (IWG) standardized response criteria for evaluating clinically significant responses in MDS first published in 2000 and modified in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapse after complete or partial remission requires at least one of the following: return to pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage, decrement of &ge;50 percent from maximum <span class=\"nowrap\">remission/response</span> levels in granulocytes or platelets; reduction in hemoglobin concentration by &ge;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or transfusion dependence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematologic progression or relapse after hematologic improvement is defined by at least one of the following in the absence of another explanation such as acute infection, repeated courses of chemotherapy, gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, or other: at least 50 percent decrement from maximum response levels in granulocytes or platelets; reduction in hemoglobin by &ge;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L;</span> or transfusion dependence.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H515614\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF RECURRENT OR REFRACTORY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a general lack of effective treatments for the management of recurrent or refractory MDS, and patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials, whenever available. As an example, although half of patients initially treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epoetin alfa</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darbepoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darbepoetin alfa</a>) will respond to therapy, most will experience relapse. A large international study reported that overall survival was comparable following second-line therapy with hypomethylating agents (eg, azacytidine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>, or other treatments in patients with lower risk MDS who developed resistance to ESA treatment; however, it is unclear from this uncontrolled retrospective study if their outcomes were superior to those of patients treated with supportive care (eg, transfusion support) alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The importance of enrolling these patients on a clinical trial was illustrated in a retrospective analysis of 435 patients with relapsed or refractory MDS following initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a> for high-risk MDS or refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. After a median follow-up after azacitidine failure of 15 months, the median overall survival was 5.6 months and the overall survival at two years was 15 percent. Patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or were enrolled on a clinical trial appeared to have better outcomes when compared with those treated with conventional care. However, these better outcomes may have more to do with patient selection than with treatment on a trial or with the use of HCT itself. (See <a href=\"#H515621\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> below.)</p><p>A frequent issue is the extent of evaluation that is needed when disease recurs after an earlier response. In general, the evaluation is dependent upon the clinical findings at relapse. As an example, if a patient has worsening anemia after initially responding to an ESA, it may not be necessary to perform any specific restaging evaluation before proceeding with a trial of another therapy, such as an ESA plus G-CSF. In contrast, if a patient develops blasts on the peripheral smear, then a repeat bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with cytogenetic and molecular genetic evaluation would be appropriate because it is likely that the MDS has entered another stage.</p><p>Outside of a clinical trial, the management of patients with recurrent or refractory MDS is largely dependent upon the patient's prior therapy. Patients often discontinue an initial treatment of MDS due to intolerance rather than resistance. Patients who have not yet been treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a> (eg, those previously treated with an ESA, transplantation, or immunosuppressive therapy) may be offered a trial of one of these agents.
