However, HTLV-I is associated with disease in only approximately 5 percent of infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis and treatment of HTLV-I infection and what is known about the disease associations will be reviewed here. The virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of HTLV-I are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human T-lymphotropic virus type I: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of HTLV-I-infected individuals will remain asymptomatic, but there are two well-recognized disease associations caused by the virus:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM), also known as tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP).</p><p/><p>In addition, several other clinical entities have been described in infected patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66919 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HTLV-I was first isolated from a patient with a cutaneous T cell lymphoma in 1980 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Since then it has become clear that the cumulative lifetime risk of ATL in a patient with HTLV-I infection is between 2 and 5 percent. The risk is slightly higher in males; the onset of ATL is typically delayed for 20 to 30 years after the viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ATL is characterized by clonal proliferation of CD4+ T cells containing randomly integrated HTLV-I provirus, often associated with T cell receptor gene rearrangements. These cells have a distinct morphology with indented nuclei containing condensed chromatin and basophilic cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72646\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72646 \">picture 1</a>). Four distinct clinical forms of ATL are recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute ATL accounts for 47 to 57 percent of cases and follows an aggressive course with a median survival of six months. Clinical features include: skin lesions (nodules, ulcers, generalized papular rash), lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, and pulmonary infiltrates. The latter may be due either to direct leukemic infiltration or to opportunistic infections such as <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (formerly <em>carinii</em>) pneumonia (PCP) resulting from AIDS-like immunodeficiency. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement occurs in up to 10 percent of cases. Laboratory findings include raised levels of lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase as well as hypercalcemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymphomatous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lymphomatous form of ATL occurs in approximately 20 to 25 percent of cases. The clinical features include lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and skin lesions. Hypercalcemia is also common, but circulating tumor cells are unusual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chronic form, which accounts for 20 percent of cases, has a better prognosis with a median survival of approximately two years. Hypercalcemia does not occur, and there is no CNS or gastrointestinal involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoldering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoldering ATL is the least common type (approximately 5 percent of cases); median survival is more than five years. Skin and pulmonary lesions do occur, but other clinical features such as lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and hypercalcemia are absent. Less than 5 percent of peripheral CD4+ cells are involved, with proviral DNA integrated in a monoclonal fashion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Markers of disease progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several serum markers have been found to be elevated, especially in the acute form of ATL. These include serum CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor), serum thymidine kinase activity, and serum neuron-specific enolase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Investigators have proposed that CD25 and enolase, the levels of which are highly correlated, may serve as markers of disease progression and might be monitored during treatment. However, these tests are not currently used in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of standard regimens for advanced, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is moderately effective, with most patients achieving initial partial or complete remission. However, early relapse is usual and median survival is only eight months.</p><p>A phase III trial comparing biweekly CHOP with a more aggressive chemotherapeutic regimen of VCAP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) plus AMP (doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisone) plus VECP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vindesine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vindesine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, and prednisone) in 118 Japanese patients demonstrated significantly higher complete response rates with the more aggressive regimen (40 percent versus 25 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, overall survival at three years was similar and toxicity-related morbidity and death was greater in the aggressive chemotherapy arm. Thus, the use of intensive combination chemotherapy remains investigational.</p><p>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation has been reported to benefit some patients already in remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A combination of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> (ZDV), plus interferon (IFN)-alfa was found to be effective in the short term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Chemotherapy for ATL is discussed in detail separately.

A group in Japan called the condition HAM in 1986 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], but it was soon realized that TSP and HAM were the same entities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">HAM/TSP</span> is more common in females than males, in keeping with the higher prevalence of HTLV-I infection in females. It affects less than 2 percent of HTLV-I carriers, with onset ranging from four months to 30 years (median 3.3 years) after infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In another prospective cohort analysis, HTLV-1-associated myelopathy was found in 3.7 percent (95% CI 1.4-8.0) and HTLV-II myelopathy in 1.0 percent (95% CI 0.3-2.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The risk factors for developing <span class=\"nowrap\">HAM/TSP</span> are not well understood. One important risk factor appears to be a high provirus load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, certain polymorphisms in the interleukin (IL)-10 promoter and in the IL28B gene, which is involved in interferon lambda expression, may be associated with both provirus load and the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">HAM/TSP</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. </p><p>The illness is characterized by an insidious onset of slowly progressive weakness and spasticity of one or both legs, together with hyperreflexia, ankle clonus, extensor plantar responses, and lumbar pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Other features include back pain, detrusor instability leading to nocturia, urinary frequency, incontinence, and minor sensory changes, especially paresthesias and loss of vibration sense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Cognitive function is unaffected and there is no upper limb involvement. </p><p>Individuals with HTLV-1 infection also appear to have an excess of neurological manifestations, even if they do not meet criteria for <span class=\"nowrap\">HAM/TSP</span>.

In addition to the laboratory diagnostic tests listed in table 2, the use of HTLV-1 proviral load in the central nervous system (CNS) has been proposed as a new parameter for diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">HAM/TSP</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord may be normal or may show atrophy of the cervical or thoracic cord <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> white matter lesions in the subcortical and periventricular regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination reveals a low level lymphocytosis in approximately one-third of cases as well as a mildly elevated protein concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Anti-HTLV-I antibodies are detectable in the CSF with a high <span class=\"nowrap\">CSF/serum</span> ratio. Virus can be cultured from CSF lymphocytes and proviral DNA detected by PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Neurophysiologic studies may reveal evidence of posterior column dysfunction as well as a peripheral neuropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of <span class=\"nowrap\">HAM/TSP</span> is primarily symptomatic, as disease-modifying treatment options are limited. Systemic corticosteroids are often used, as they have been reported in some case series to slow progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], reduce neurologic disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and improve pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], presumably through their anti-inflammatory effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Clinical progression was highly variable in this small cohort. The most severely affected subjects were wheelchair bound, while patients with mild cases only experienced difficulty rising from a chair.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Other disease manifestations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Other neurological abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to myelopathy, HTLV-1 infection is also associated with other neurological abnormalities, including isolated mild cognitive deficits, peripheral neuropathy, neurogenic bladder dysfunction, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In one study of 606 HTLV-1 infected individuals in Brazil, HTLV-1 proviral loads in patients with these neurologic manifestations were significantly higher than in asymptomatic carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

A study that included 251 HTLV-1-infected individuals in Brazil reported that over a maximum of eight years of follow-up, approximately 30 percent developed neurological manifestations without fulfilling the case definition for <span class=\"nowrap\">HAM/TSP</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, these findings need to be interpreted with caution. No control group was used and self-reported symptoms to a team of neurologists, urologists, rheumatologists, psychologists, and dentists were used in determining the frequency of the neurological findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Infective dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infective dermatitis was first described in Jamaica in 1966 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Subsequently, its association with HTLV-I infection was recognized in several endemic areas, including Japan and the Caribbean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. The onset is usually in early childhood, and the condition tends to improve with age. In a series of 42 cases from Brazil, the mean age of onset was 2.6 years (range 2 months to 11 years), with skin lesions appearing during the first year of life in about one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Remission occurred in 36 percent of cases, at a mean age of 15 years. </p><p>It is characterized by an eczematous, exudative rash affecting the scalp, postauricular region, face, axillae and groins. This may be associated with nasal involvement, including watery discharge and crusting of the anterior nares, and dermatopathic lymphadenopathy. Although the condition is caused primarily by HTLV-1 infection, secondary infection with Staphylococcus aureus or beta-hemolytic streptococci is common. Consequently, it usually responds well to antibiotics but tends to relapse upon stopping therapy.</p><p>In the Brazilian case series, almost one-half of the patients who had long-term follow-up were also ultimately diagnosed with HTLV-associated <span class=\"nowrap\">myelopathy/tropical</span> spastic paraparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Subsequent studies from Japan have also described radiographic and pathologic findings consistent with a lymphocytic bronchiolitis associated with HTLV-1 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/54-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-58</a>]. However, since these features may be found in asymptomatic patients, their clinical significance remains uncertain. </p><p>Indigenous Australians have one of the highest prevalence rates of bronchiectasis in the world. One prospective study among indigenous Australians found a very high seroprevalence of HTLV type 1 among hospitalized patients with bronchiectasis (nearly 60 percent) compared with historical background HTLV-1 prevalence rates (7 to 14 percent), suggesting that HTLV-1 infection may contribute to the risk of developing this pulmonary disease in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p>A high prevalence of bronchiectasis has also been reported in a UK cohort of HTLV-1 positive patients attending a national referral center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Overall, 3.4 percent had bronchiectasis confirmed by high resolution chest CT, compared with a reported prevalence of 0.1 percent in the general population.

HTLV-1 infection was associated with a reduced risk of H. pylori infection and a lower risk of gastric cancer (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21-0.70).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of HTLV-I infection is generally based upon serologic testing to detect antibodies to the virus. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most frequently used screening test, using antigens prepared from whole virus lysate or by recombinant technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].
