Severe cholera is characterized by profound fluid and electrolyte losses in the stool and the rapid development of hypovolemic shock, often within 24 hours from the initial onset of vomiting and diarrhea. Administration of appropriate rehydration therapy reduces the mortality of severe cholera from over 10 percent to less than 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic discusses the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cholera. The microbiology and pathogenesis of <em>V. cholerae</em> and infections caused by <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> strains are discussed elsewhere.

Only cholera toxin-producing (toxigenic) strains of <em>V. cholerae </em>are associated with cholera. <em>V. cholerae</em> is classified serologically; of over 200 serological groups identified, only 2 (<em>V. cholerae</em> O1 and O139) have caused cholera epidemics. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholera-microbiology-and-pathogenesis#H2795158396\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholera: Microbiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H938291613\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholera is vastly underreported, and precise measurements of the morbidity and mortality attributable to <em>V. cholerae </em>infection are lacking. However, there are an estimated 3 million cases of diarrheal illness and approximately 100,000 deaths worldwide caused by <em>V. cholerae</em> annually<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H930102158\"><span class=\"h2\">Global distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholera primarily affects resource-limited settings where there is inadequate access to clean water sources. Cholera is endemic in approximately 50 countries (defined as having reported cholera cases in at least three of the five past years), mostly in Africa and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93307\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93307 \">figure 1</a>). In addition, epidemics due to <em>V. cholerae</em> have occurred throughout Africa, Asia, the Middle East, South and Central America, and the Caribbean, and can be particularly extensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As an example, the strain implicated in the 2010 outbreak in Haiti was subsequently associated with outbreaks in the neighboring countries of Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Mexico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Cases in resource-rich settings are generally imported from travel to endemic or epidemic settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H320774493\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>V. cholerae</em> infection is primarily acquired by ingesting contaminated food or water. In endemic regions, <em>V. cholerae</em> in the water are an important reservoir of the organism. Because <em>V. cholerae</em> can live on chitinous plankton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], filtration of water through coarse cloth can reduce the incidence of cholera in endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H930101580\" class=\"local\">'Preventing transmission'</a> below.)</p><p>While exposure to environmental <em>V. cholerae</em> is important, direct person-to-person transmission is also thought to play a role in transmission. Individuals with severe cholera can excrete as many as 10<sup>10</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> organisms per liter of stool. Organisms that were recently shed from infected individuals appear to be transiently more infectious than organisms isolated from the aquatic environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Mathematical models suggest that person-to-person transmission of human-shed, hyper-infectious <em>V. cholerae</em> is essential for the rapid propagation of cholera that is observed during epidemics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholera-microbiology-and-pathogenesis#H2917349817\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholera: Microbiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Hyperinfectivity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H595191151\"><span class=\"h2\">Endemic versus epidemic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patterns of cholera transmission and infection differ between historically endemic areas and areas experiencing cholera epidemics. </p><p>In areas of high endemicity, the incidence of <em>V. cholerae</em> infection follows a seasonal distribution, with peaks before and after rainy seasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Superimposed epidemics may also occur, and mathematical models suggest these epidemics are dependent on fluctuations in population based immunity and climate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In areas of high endemicity, the incidence of cholera is highest in children younger than five years, likely reflecting the lack of protective immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In areas with more limited immunity in the population, massive epidemics may occur, with similar attack rates in children and adults. The cholera epidemic in Haiti is an example of the consequences of the introduction of <em>V. cholerae </em>into a na&iuml;ve population. A <em>V. cholerae</em> O1 variant El Tor strain was introduced into Haiti from South Asia possibly via United Nations stabilization forces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Within two years, 604,634 cases of infection, 329,697 hospitalizations, and 7436 deaths from cholera were reported in Haiti [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Even in endemic regions, breakdowns in safe water, hygiene, and health services can contribute to epidemic transmission of cholera. In Yemen, where public health and healthcare infrastructure has been devastated by years of warfare, two rapidly sequential outbreaks occurred at the end of 2016 and the middle of 2017. The second of these outbreaks amounts to the world's worst cholera outbreak to date, with approximately 500,000 cases of suspected cholera and 2000 associated fatalities recorded within only four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Other major outbreaks have occurred in Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nigeria, Angola, Vietnam, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe. Experience from such outbreaks demonstrates that fatality rates in epidemic cholera are consistently higher than 1 percent, particularly in the early stages of an epidemic and in rural areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As an example, in the 2008 to 2009 cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe, which involved nearly 100,000 people, the case fatality rate was over 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H595191410\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most risk factors for cholera reflect the underlying mode of transmission via contaminated food and water. For example, drinking un-boiled or untreated water is a commonly identified risk factor for cholera, while use of soap is associated with a lower likelihood of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In some, primarily foodborne cholera outbreaks, risk factors may include consumption of specific foods, including rice products, or specific vegetables or fruits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In areas where cholera occurs sporadically, most cases are associated with shellfish consumption.</p><p>Other risk factors for <em>V. cholerae </em>infection and cholera reflect the biological interaction between the host and pathogen, including blood group O (associated with more severe cholera), hypochlorhydria (lowers the dose needed to cause infection), retinol deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. Breastfeeding has been consistently shown to be protective against cholera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholera-microbiology-and-pathogenesis#H4004052879\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholera: Microbiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Host susceptibility'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H938291631\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection with <em>V. cholerae</em> results in a spectrum of disease, ranging from asymptomatic intestinal colonization to severe diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Abdominal discomfort, borborygmi, and vomiting are other common symptoms, particularly in the early phases of disease. Among those with severe disease, most complications are related to the substantial volume and electrolyte loss from diarrhea. Fever is uncommon. </p><p>The clinical manifestations of cholera caused by <em>V. cholerae</em> O1 versus O139 are indistinguishable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H609426356\"><span class=\"h2\">Incubation period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholera has a typical incubation period of one to two days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. However, the incubation period of cholera varies with host susceptibility and inoculum size and can range from several hours to as long as three to five days. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H609426457\"><span class=\"h2\">Diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While mild cases of<em> V. cholerae</em> infection may be clinically indistinguishable from other causes of diarrheal illness, the profound and rapid loss of fluid and electrolytes mark severe cholera as a clinically distinct entity. Cholera stools may contain fecal matter and bile in the early phases of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the characteristic symptom of severe cholera (&quot;cholera gravis&quot;) is the passage of profuse &quot;rice-water&quot; stool, a watery stool with flecks of mucous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93210\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93210 \">picture 1</a>). It typically has a fishy odor. The diarrhea is usually painless, without tenesmus. In adults, stool output can reach as high as 1 liter per hour in the most severe cases. In children, the maximal rate of stool excretion in severe cholera is typically between 10 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/kg/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This rate of fluid loss is not typically observed in other causes of diarrheal illness. </p><p>In addition, compared with other causes of childhood diarrheal illness, stool from cholera patients contains a higher concentration of sodium, as well as significant amounts of potassium and bicarbonate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93208 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>In patients treated with proper rehydration, diarrhea is most severe during the first two days and ends after four to six days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. The total volume loss over the course of illness may be up to 100 percent of body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H609426600\"><span class=\"h2\">Other gastrointestinal symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vomiting, frequently with watery emesis, is common, and may begin either before or after the onset of diarrhea. Patients may have abdominal cramping but typically do not have the frank abdominal pain classically associated with dysentery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H930102246\"><span class=\"h2\">Manifestations of hypovolemia and electrolyte loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the rapid fluid and electrolyte loss characteristic of diarrhea associated with severe cholera, hypovolemia and electrolyte abnormalities are the most important sequelae. Severe hypovolemia may occur within hours of the onset of symptoms. In the early stages of the cholera epidemic in Haiti, the median time between onset of symptoms and death in individuals who died before presentation to a cholera treatment center was 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Cholera patients with severe hypovolemia may have sunken eyes, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, decreased skin turgor, or wrinkled hands and feet (also known as &quot;washer woman's hands&quot;). Patients are frequently apathetic and lethargic. Acidosis from loss of stool bicarbonate as well as lactic acidosis from poor perfusion may result in Kussmaul breathing (deep respirations reflecting compensatory hyperventilation). The peripheral pulse is rapid and thready initially, and it may become difficult to palpate as blood pressure drops. Muscle cramping and weakness due to loss of potassium and calcium are common. </p><p>Laboratory testing of cholera patients may reveal hypokalemia, hyponatremia or hypernatremia (although cholera is most often associated with isonatremic dehydration), hypocalcemia, and acidosis.</p><p>Renal failure with acute tubular necrosis may occur as urine output decreases. In children, depletion of glycogen stores and inadequate gluconeogenesis can lead to symptoms of severe hypoglycemia or even coma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H595191434\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumonia has been described as a frequent comorbidity among children with cholera, potentially from aspiration in the setting of vomiting, and has been associated with mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Blood stream invasion by the organism is rare. Fever is also infrequent, so the presence of an elevated temperature should prompt consideration of a concurrent infection or complication.</p><p>&quot;Cholera sicca&quot; is an unusual form of the disease in which fluid accumulates in the intestinal lumen; circulatory collapse and even death can occur in the absence of diarrhea.</p><p>In general, there are no long-term complications of cholera when it is appropriately treated. However, like other causes of childhood diarrheal illness, cholera may contribute to the development of chronic enteropathy and malnutrition in young children. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H682183340\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mortality of cholera in untreated patients may reach 50 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Administration of appropriate rehydration therapy can reduce the mortality of severe cholera to less than 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In areas where cholera is endemic, the mortality risk is increased in children (10 times greater than in adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Although earlier studies had suggested a high risk of fetal death associated with cholera during pregnancy (up to 50 percent during the third trimester), more recent studies have reported a lower, but still elevated, risk (approximately 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H938291637\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of cholera are presumptively diagnosed based on clinical suspicion in patients who present with severe acute watery diarrhea. The diagnosis can be confirmed by isolation of <em>V. cholerae</em> from stool cultures performed on specific selective media. Rapid tests such as stool dipsticks or darkfield microscopy can support the diagnosis in settings where stool culture is not readily available. (See <a href=\"#H682183435\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic studies'</a> below.)</p><p>However, because of the morbidity of severe cholera, the variable availability of diagnostic testing in endemic and epidemic settings, and the general applicability of fluid resuscitation to other causes of severe watery diarrhea, management of cholera should be initiated on the basis of clinical suspicion. (See <a href=\"#H938291643\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H682183334\"><span class=\"h2\">When to suspect cholera</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholera is a potential cause of any case of severe watery diarrhea with or without vomiting, especially in patients who develop rapid and severe volume depletion. Whereas many different microbial pathogens can lead to volume-depleting diarrhea in children, <em>V. cholerae</em> is the primary etiology in adults with such a presentation. </p><p>Specifically, according to the World Health Organization, cholera should always be suspected when a patient five years or older develops severe volume depletion from acute watery diarrhea, even in an area where cholera is not known to be endemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In endemic areas, cholera should be suspected in patients two years or older with severe acute watery diarrhea. </p><p>In resource-rich settings where cholera is rare, epidemiologic clues that might increase the suspicion of <em>V. cholerae</em> in a patient with watery diarrhea include travel to endemic areas or areas where cholera outbreaks are occurring or ingestion of undercooked or raw shellfish. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H682183435\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic studies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H682183441\"><span class=\"h3\">Stool culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A definitive diagnosis of cholera is based on isolation of the organism from clinical samples, which also permits a determination of the antibiotic susceptibility profile. <em>V. cholerae</em> can be isolated from stool using selective media such as thiosulfate citrate bile sucrose (TCBS) agar or taurocholate tellurite gelatin agar (TTGA). Once cultured,<em> V. cholerae</em> can be identified by biochemical tests; serogroup and serotype can be assigned by testing with specific antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In settings such as the United States, where cholera is a sporadic illness, the clinical microbiology laboratory should be informed of a suspicion of cholera so that appropriate selective media can be used. These selective media are not routinely used for stool culture.</p><p>The recovery of viable <em>V. cholerae</em> from clinical specimens can be enhanced by enrichment in alkaline peptone water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. <em>V. cholerae</em> can also persist in a number of standard transport media, including Cary-Blair media, while being transported to a central laboratory from field settings. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H682183590\"><span class=\"h3\">Rapid tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several rapid tests which may be performed to make a presumptive diagnosis of cholera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. These include commercially available immunochromatographic lateral flow devices (dipsticks), such as Crystal VC (Span Diagnostics), which detect the presence of the O1 or O139 antigen in rice water stool samples. While the sensitivity of Crystal VC is over 95 percent, the specificity of the test has ranged between 65 to 85 percent in field settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The low specificity of dipstick tests can limit their diagnostic utility in endemic areas, but a preponderance of positive tests in a small cohort of patients with diarrhea is useful in confirming a suspected outbreak in settings where cholera was not previously known to be endemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Darkfield microscopy of fresh rice-water stools (at 400x magnification) can also be used to rapidly evaluate for the presence of highly motile Vibrios, whose shooting star-like motion can be inhibited by the subsequent addition of specific antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Darkfield microscopy is quite specific for <em>V. cholerae</em> but lacks sufficient sensitivity for it to be used reliably for diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H682183327\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further clinical evaluation of the patient with suspected or confirmed cholera includes an assessment of the degree of volume depletion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74796 \">table 2</a>), as this determines the management strategy. (See <a href=\"#H234135\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of fluid loss'</a> below.)</p><p>Laboratory testing is generally not needed, although serum electrolyte and glucose testing may be helpful to identify extreme abnormalities in patients who have ileus, confusion, seizure, or no urine output in response to fluid replacement.

In resource-limited settings, where cholera most commonly occurs, rotavirus and cryptosporidium are frequent causative pathogens among infants and young children, whereas enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em> predominates among older children and adults.</p><p>There are no signs or symptoms that can unequivocally distinguish cholera from other infectious causes of severe watery diarrhea. However, as above, suspicion for cholera should be raised if watery diarrhea is accompanied by severe and rapid volume depletion or occurs in an outbreak setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H938291643\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aggressive volume repletion is the mainstay of treatment for cholera. Replacement fluids can be given orally, except in the cases of severe volume depletion or shock, in which rapid fluid repletion is warranted and intravenous fluids should thus be given. Antibiotics are an adjunctive therapy for patients with some to severe volume depletion and may be of particular use in epidemic settings. Ensuring adequate nutrition is important for all patients, and children may additionally benefit from supplementation of certain micronutrients.</p><p>These issues are discussed in detail below. The discussion is consistent with recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO), which are based upon the natural history and pathophysiology of cholera as well as practical considerations from a public health standpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233446\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid management of a patient with suspected or confirmed cholera is guided by the level of volume depletion and an assessment of ongoing fluid losses. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H234135\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of fluid loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume status can be readily assessed through simple examination of the mental status, eyes, mouth, skin, and pulse.

For these reasons, the most common errors in caring for patients with cholera include underestimating the amount of fluid needed to correct volume depletion and replace ongoing losses, or the use of incorrect, non-isotonic fluids to replace stool losses. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with some volume depletion &mdash; Oral rehydration solution (ORS) should be used for volume repletion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57007\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57007 \">table 4</a>), as it is as effective as and more practical than intravenous fluid repletion in this setting (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-therapy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral rehydration therapy&quot;, section on 'Efficacy'</a>). In 2002, WHO recommended the use of a reduced osmolar ORS, which has been demonstrated to decrease stool output, vomiting, and the need for supplemental intravenous fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Among patients with cholera, subclinical hyponatremia is common with this WHO recommended ORS formulation, but rates of symptomatic hyponatremia do not appear to be significantly increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. A rice-based ORS that includes rice powder instead of glucose has also been demonstrated to reduce the duration of diarrhea and stool losses in severe cholera but is more tedious to prepare<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

In patients with cholera, intravenous Ringer's lactate is the best commercially available intravenous solution for this purpose as it includes potassium and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, which are both lost in cholera stools (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93208 \">table 1</a>). However, locally-prepared fluids, such as &quot;Dhaka solution,&quot; containing glucose and more potassium than Ringer's lactate are available in some cholera-endemic regions and can address potential complications of severe cholera including hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. </p><p/><p>Patients with severe cholera typically require an average of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of isotonic oral or intravenous fluids in the first 24 hours of therapy and may require more than 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

However, access to appropriate rehydration therapy is an important obstacle, particularly during cholera epidemics. For this reason, a community-based response and the strategic use of decentralized treatment centers (ie, oral rehydration points) to improve access to therapy are crucial to the successful management of cholera outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233153\"><span class=\"h3\">Continued monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume status should be assessed through physical exam on an ongoing basis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74796 \">table 2</a>), more frequently for more severe volume depletion.

Antibiotics can be administered once the initial volume deficit is corrected and vomiting has ceased.</p><p>The antibiotic options for cholera include macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines. The choice between them should be based on availability and local resistance patterns.</p><p>Tetracyclines are the antibiotic class for which there is greatest clinical experience, and several trials have demonstrated the efficacy of tetracyclines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/55,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,57</a>].

Strains of <em>V. cholerae</em> that do not produce toxin do not cause cholera. <em>V. cholerae</em> is classified serologically, based on differences in the structure of the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide. Of over 200 serological groups identified, only two (<em>V. cholerae</em> O1 and O139) have caused cholera epidemics.

Cholera primarily affects resource-limited settings where there is inadequate access to clean water sources, as infection is most frequently acquired by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with <em>V. cholerae</em>. Cholera is endemic in approximately 50 countries, mostly in Africa and Asia, and has caused extensive epidemics throughout Africa, Asia, the Middle East, South and Central America, and the Caribbean (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93307\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93307 \">figure 1</a>). Patterns of cholera transmission and infection differ between historically endemic areas and areas experiencing cholera epidemics.

While mild cases of<em> V. cholerae</em> infection may be clinically indistinguishable from other causes of watery diarrheal illness, the profound and rapid loss of fluid and electrolytes mark severe cholera as a clinical entity distinct from other causes. Significant hypovolemia and electrolyte abnormalities, which can occur within a few hours of symptom onset, are the most important sequelae of severe cholera. Abdominal discomfort, borborygmi, and vomiting are other common symptoms, particularly in the early phases of disease. (See <a href=\"#H938291631\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases of cholera are presumptively diagnosed, based on consistent clinical manifestations. Cholera is a potential cause of any case of severe watery diarrhea with or without vomiting, especially in patients who develop rapid and severe volume depletion. Whereas many different microbial pathogens can lead to volume depleting diarrhea in young children, <em>V. cholerae</em> is the primary etiology in older individuals with such a presentation. The diagnosis can be confirmed by isolation from stool cultures performed on specific selective media. Rapid tests such as stool dipsticks or darkfield microscopy can support the diagnosis in settings where stool culture is not readily available. (See <a href=\"#H938291637\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive volume repletion is the mainstay of treatment for cholera. The type and quantity of fluids to administer is determined by the level of volume depletion and an assessment of ongoing fluid losses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74796 \">table 2</a>). Replacement&nbsp;fluids can be given orally, except in the cases of severe volume depletion or shock, in which rapid fluid repletion is warranted and intravenous fluids should thus be given. Patients with severe cholera typically require an average of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of isotonic oral or intravenous fluids in the first 24 hours of therapy and may require more than 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span>. (See <a href=\"#H233446\" class=\"local\">'Fluid management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics can shorten the duration of diarrhea, reduce the volume of stool losses, and lessen the duration of <em>V. cholera</em> shedding. We suggest antibiotics for patients who have moderate to severe volume depletion in the setting of suspected or documented cholera (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We also suggest antibiotics for patients who have suspected or documented cholera in the setting of an epidemic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Antibiotics are usually given orally, after initial rehydration and when the patient is no longer vomiting. The antibiotic options for cholera include macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71548\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71548 \">table 5</a>). The choice between them should be based on availability and local resistance patterns. (See <a href=\"#H234666\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with other causes of acute diarrhea, adequate nutrition in patients with cholera is important to prevent malnutrition and facilitate recovery of normal gastrointestinal function. In addition, children with acute diarrhea may benefit from zinc and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> supplementation. (See <a href=\"#H609426625\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition and vitamins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clean water supply and appropriate sanitation are the cornerstones of cholera prevention. In addition, two oral cholera vaccines that are available internationally have demonstrated protective efficacy of 60 to 80 percent in areas at high risk of outbreak. These vaccines may be particularly useful as part of cholera prevention programs in endemic areas or in areas at high risk for cholera epidemics. (See <a href=\"#H938291649\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sack DA, Sack RB, Nair GB, Siddique AK.
