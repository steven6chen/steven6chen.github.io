A couple might not be able to get pregnant because of an issue with the man's body, the woman's body, or both.</p><p>When a couple has trouble getting pregnant, doctors often do tests in both partners to try to figure out the cause. But even with tests, doctors sometimes cannot figure out why a couple can't get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459785405\"><span class=\"h1\">When should we see a doctor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most doctors recommend that a couple begin having tests if they cannot get pregnant after having unprotected sex for 1 year. But if you are worried, talk with your doctor or nurse. He or she might recommend that you have tests done sooner. Tests are done sooner in women over 35. Tests are also done sooner in women who don't have a period every month.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459785412\"><span class=\"h1\">What tests are done for men?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are a man, your doctor will ask you questions about your health and sex history, and do an exam. He or she will often order a test to check how many sperm you make and how healthy your sperm are.</p><p>Other tests that a man might have include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; Some blood tests check male hormone levels. Abnormal hormone levels can make it hard to get your partner pregnant. Other blood tests can check if you have a genetic condition that can make it hard to get your partner pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound &ndash; This imaging test creates pictures of the inside of the body and can check if a sex organ is abnormal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 1</a>). For example, some men have a block in a structure called the &quot;vas deferens,&quot; which is the tube that sperm needs to travel through.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests &ndash; Urine tests can check if sperm are moving in the wrong direction and going back into the bladder during sex instead of out the penis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy &ndash; A biopsy might be done if a sperm test shows that a man has zero or a very small amount of sperm. During a biopsy, a doctor collects a small tissue sample from inside the testicle. Then the doctor can look at the sample under a microscope to check if sperm are present.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459785419\"><span class=\"h1\">What tests are done for women?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are a woman, your doctor will ask you questions about your health, monthly periods, and sex history. He or she will also do an exam.</p><p>Women might then have 1 or more of the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; Blood tests can check female hormone levels. Abnormal hormone levels can make it hard to get pregnant. Blood tests can also be done to check for genetic problems that can make it hard to get pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovulation tests &ndash; Different tests can be used to check if a woman is ovulating. Ovulation is when an egg is released from the ovary into the fallopian tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 2</a>). It needs to occur for a woman to get pregnant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73238\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73238 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to check the uterus and fallopian tubes &ndash; These tests are described below. Problems with the fallopian tubes and uterus can make it hard to get pregnant. For example, some women are born with an abnormally-shaped uterus. Or women might have blocked fallopian tubes from past infections or surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459785426\"><span class=\"h1\">What tests check the uterus and fallopian tubes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can do different tests to check for problems with the uterus and fallopian tubes. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound, X-ray, or other imaging tests &ndash; These tests can create pictures of the inside of the body and can check for blockages or other problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests that look inside the body &ndash; These tests are not as simple as imaging tests, because they involve procedures. A doctor can look inside the body using a small tube with a camera on the end. He or she can put the tube into the vagina, past the cervix, and up into the uterus to look at the inside of the uterus. He or she can also put the tube through a small opening in the skin in the lower part of the belly to look at the outside of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459785433\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after the tests are done?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Test results might show that one or both partners have a problem that can be treated. In that case, treatment will likely be aimed at fixing that problem.</p><p>Some people might have a problem that can't be treated. Or the tests might not show what the problem is. In these cases, there are other treatments that doctors can do to help couples get pregnant. Talk with your doctor about different treatment options so that you can choose which treatment is right for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459785440\"><span class=\"h1\">What else can we do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trying to get pregnant can be tough on couples. People can feel sad, worried, angry, or guilty. It is important to get help for these feelings. You might find it helpful to learn ways to relax, or to go to a support group for people who are trying to get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459785447\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Infertility in men (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Infertility in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=absent-or-irregular-periods-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Absent or irregular periods (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-male-infertility-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Treatment of male infertility (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ovulation induction with clomiphene (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-treatment-with-gonadotropins-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Infertility treatment with gonadotropins (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization-ivf-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: In vitro fertilization (IVF) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=absent-or-irregular-periods-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Absent or irregular periods (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
