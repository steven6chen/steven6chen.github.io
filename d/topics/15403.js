The prevalence of schizophrenia (ie, the number of cases in a population at any one time point) approaches 1 percent internationally. The incidence (the number of new cases annually) is about 1.5 per 10,000 people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Age of onset is typically during adolescence; childhood and late-life onset (over 45 years) are rare. Slightly more men are diagnosed with schizophrenia than women (on the order of 1.4:1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and women tend to be diagnosed later in life than men.

The overall cost of schizophrenia in the United States in 2002 was estimated at about $63 billion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This figure includes direct healthcare costs and indirect costs associated with loss of productivity. A study comparing the cost of schizophrenia in India in 2001 with the cost in the same catchment area in 2011 found that the cost had doubled in those 10 years, mainly related to increases in indirect costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A study examining United States insurance claims found that the annual health-related expenses of someone with chronic schizophrenia averaged more than $15,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The cost of schizophrenia treatment from 2004 to 2009 to Medicare in the United States increased from $9.4 billion to $11.5 billion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H296339\"><span class=\"h2\">Deficit schizophrenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deficit schizophrenia, characterized by primary, enduring negative symptoms, seems to be a specific disease process within the larger syndrome of schizophrenia. Approximately 15 to 20 percent of the total schizophrenia population has the deficit form of schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. They are more likely to be male and more likely to have relatives with schizophrenia than people with nondeficit schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. As opposed to the excess of late winter-early spring births observed in schizophrenia in general, there is a disproportionate rate of summer births in the deficit group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/22,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,31</a>]. Examples of negative symptoms include decreased expressiveness, apathy, flat affect, and a lack of energy. People with deficit schizophrenia are less likely to have addictions, depression, suicidality, or delusions with high emotional content (such as jealous delusions) compared to nondeficit schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H2265295\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Schizophrenia in adults: Clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Deficit schizophrenia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31673369\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the pathogenesis of the disorder is unknown, it is almost certain that schizophrenia represents a syndrome comprised of multiple diseases that present with similar signs and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This heterogeneity complicates the elucidation of the etiological and pathophysiological factors that underlie the group of disorders. Schizophrenia appears to be a uniquely human condition, which limits the utility of animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. There is little doubt that schizophrenia proceeds from a complex interaction between genes and the environment, but even the attempt to differentiate genetic from environmental risk factors may be artificial, since environmental factors can influence gene expression just as a person&rsquo;s genetic make-up can influence response to environmental stressors. </p><p>Research studies have found the following genetic and environmental risk factors in schizophrenia, which may act through disrupted neurotransmitter system function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31673376\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Twin studies have been conducted in monozygotic and dizygotic twins to examine concordance rates of schizophrenia within the twin pairs. The observed concordance rate in monozygotic twins, who share 100 percent of their genes, is about 40 to 50 percent, whereas the observed concordance rate in dizygotic twins, who share 50 percent of their genes, is about 10 to 15 percent. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. The increased concordance rate of schizophrenia in monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins suggests a strong genetic component to schizophrenia. The offspring of the unaffected monozygotic twins are at increased risk of schizophrenia, which further supports the existence of a genetic predisposition for the illness. The fact that the monozygotic twin concordance rate is less than 100 percent, however, suggests that nongenetic, environmental factors are also involved in the development of the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. Adoption studies have provided further evidence for the presence of genetic risk factors.</p><p>Although there is abundant evidence for genetic risk factors, the specific genes involved in the etiology of schizophrenia have not been identified. Initial studies have used genetic linkage or candidate gene approaches to identify several specific genes as candidates for a role in the development of schizophrenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F69865\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69865 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>The mapping of the human genome has allowed for the study of associations between gene variants and risk or occurrence of diseases, ie, genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The results of GWAS of schizophrenia support a polygenic model, in which multiple genes with additive small effects lead to the disorder. As many as 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been tested in GWAS for association with schizophrenia. In a study of over 35,000 cases and 110,00 controls, 108 SNPs were found to have a significant association with schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The identified genetic loci supported the involvement of the dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The study also replicated previous studies that have shown an association between genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which support immune functions, and schizophrenia. A 2016 study of the MHC locus demonstrated that expression of complement component 4 allele A (C4A) was proportional to the risk of having schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. C4 expression and activity were then tested in mouse models and shown to be related to adolescent pruning of brain synapses. These findings are consistent with decreased &ldquo;neuropil,&rdquo; or dendritic density, which has been reliably observed in people with schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic association studies: Principles and applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another attempt to delineate the genetics of schizophrenia is the evaluation of copy number variants (CNVs), which are genes that have been duplicated or deleted. People with schizophrenia have been found to have higher rates of CNVs. The most frequent CNV associated with schizophrenia is a deletion on the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

The association between obstetrical complications and the development of schizophrenia has also been observed in data from medical records, which do not rely on recall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>In studies based on subsequent hospital records, pregnancy during famines in the Netherlands (1944 through 1945) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] and in China (1959 through 1961) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>] has been associated with a two-fold risk of schizophrenia in the offspring. The results of these studies indicate that maternal nutrition is a factor in the development of schizophrenia. Other, related factors associated with an increased risk of subsequently developing schizophrenia include being the product of an unwanted pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and the prenatal death of the father [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>Increased prenatal maternal stress has been proposed as the common pathophysiological mechanism underlying risk factors, such as famine, bereavement, and antenatal infection.

There is little evidence to suggest that the risk is associated with direct damage by the infectious agent to the central nervous system (CNS). A study comparing individuals hospitalized for meningitis as children to a control group who were hospitalized with gastroenteritis as children found no difference in the risk of later hospitalization for schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. A more likely explanation is that infection by certain agents triggers an immune response in a mother that is passed through the placenta to the developing fetus, which compromises the blood brain barrier and allows antibodies, which cross-react with CNS proteins, to enter into the developing nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Early childhood infections could also initiate an immune response and lead to a general state of increased inflammation.

Increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels have been frequently observed in schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Cytokines can alter the blood-brain barrier, or be produced locally in the CNS by activated microglia, and may be responsible for psychosis, its exacerbation, or cognitive impairments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].
