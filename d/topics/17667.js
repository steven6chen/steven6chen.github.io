Primary adrenal insufficiency is associated with both cortisol and mineralocorticoid deficiency. In contrast, secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency are associated with cortisol, but not mineralocorticoid deficiency, because aldosterone is regulated primarily by the renin-angiotensin system, which is independent of the hypothalamus and pituitary. This distinction accounts for the different clinical presentation and management of these disorders.</p><p>The management of all forms of adrenal insufficiency is reviewed here. The causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ADRENAL CRISIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adrenal crisis refers to acute adrenal insufficiency; it is most common in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, but may also occur in those with secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. It is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67329 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, the major clinical features of adrenal crisis are volume depletion and hypotension, resulting mainly from mineralocorticoid deficiency.</p><p>While secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency (isolated glucocorticoid deficiency) does not lead to volume depletion, it decreases vascular tone, which leads to hypotension. Thus, adrenal crisis occurs less frequently in patients with secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. When they do have adrenal crisis, it tends to be during acute stress, or with acute cortisol deficiency due to pituitary infarction or after surgical cure of Cushing's syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Secondary/tertiary adrenal insufficiency'</a>.)</p><p>Adrenal crisis may also occur in patients who are abruptly withdrawn from exogenous glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The biochemical features of adrenal crisis in primary adrenal insufficiency include hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. Hyponatremia occurs because of mineralocorticoid deficiency and also due to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) that is caused by cortisol (not aldosterone) deficiency. In these patients, combined mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency lead to urinary sodium loss, plasma volume depletion with increased serum urea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-and-hyperkalemia-in-adrenal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in adrenal insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with pure cortisol deficiency (eg, secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency) have slightly increased blood volume, dilutional hyponatremia, less urinary sodium loss, and no hyperkalemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adrenal crisis requires urgent diagnosis and intervention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67329 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of patients who present in possible adrenal crisis should not be delayed while diagnostic tests are performed.

Various regimens have been advocated, using short-acting (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cortisone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cortisone acetate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>) or long-acting (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>,</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>) agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64138\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64138 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Short-acting glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest replacement with a short-acting glucocorticoid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>, in two or three divided doses as the glucocorticoid of choice for the management of chronic primary adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. We suggest using the lowest glucocorticoid dose that relieves symptoms of glucocorticoid deficiency.</p><p>Short-acting regimens roughly mimic the normal diurnal rhythm. The bioavailability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> is nearly 100 percent, and serum cortisol concentrations rise rapidly in the 30 minutes or so after ingestion. However, after a large dose, the ability of corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) to bind cortisol is exceeded (it cannot bind any more cortisol at around 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As a result, the serum free cortisol increases, and is rapidly filtered into the urine, resulting in a rapid decline in serum total cortisol concentrations to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (690 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> after which the decline slows (average plasma half-life about 95 minutes). One study found elevated urinary free cortisol (UFC) for 24 hours after a single 25 mg hydrocortisone dose, but a decrease to the reference range, when the 25 mg daily dose was given in five 5 mg doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>To become biologically active, cortisone must undergo hepatic conversion to cortisol. It is either largely unabsorbed or not metabolized after intramuscular administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Because of these shortcomings, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> is generally considered to be the better choice for a short-acting glucocorticoid regimen.</p><p>In general, the replacement dose of glucocorticoid is aimed at replacing the missing cortisol or its equivalent. The average daily secretion rate of cortisol in normal subjects is 2.7 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and the range of replacement doses is wider due to interindividual variation in metabolism of the steroids and the fact that a single dose is less effective than the same amount of steroid administered in multiple doses. Based on the known secretion rate, we recommend a total daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> dose of 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span>.</p><p>Because of its short half-life, the total daily dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> is divided into two or three doses. Thrice daily administration mimics the day-curve of cortisol seen in healthy volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A typical twice-daily regimen consists of taking about two-thirds of the total dose upon arising in the morning and one-third in the afternoon to simulate the normal cortisol circadian rhythm. Three times daily regimens use decreasing doses in the morning, early afternoon, and late <span class=\"nowrap\">afternoon/early</span> evening (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">10/5/2</span>.5 mg). Most regimens avoid evening doses, because normal subjects secrete little cortisol from about 6 PM to 3 AM.</p><p>Authors recommend a variety of replacement doses, including 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> given thrice daily, 10 mg morning, and 5 mg in the afternoon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], 20 mg total dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and 15 to 25 mg daily given in two or three divided doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydrocortisone</a> has some mineralocorticoid activity, so <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a> replacement (if needed) must be decreased appropriately. Hydrocortisone dose recommendations are similar for patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypopituitarism#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypopituitarism&quot;, section on 'ACTH deficiency'</a>.)</p><p>The interaction of concurrent medications that alter <em>CYP3A4 </em>metabolism of glucocorticoids should be considered when choosing the dose, as it may require adjustment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>While some patients do well on single dose administration, we recommend that a split dose be used when initiating therapy, and that a single dose be used only if patients are not compliant with the afternoon dose. In one small study, quality of life and patient preference were greatest during three weeks with a split dose regimen (20 mg at 0700h and 10 mg at 1900h) rather than a single total dose in the morning or evening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There are no studies comparing quality of life of two versus three dose regimens.</p><p>Advantages of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> include the potential for fine dose adjustments using various tablet strengths. Additionally, one study found that smaller fractionated doses of hydrocortisone (10 mg twice daily) avoided increased intraocular pressure found with a higher dose (20 mg and 10 mg split dose) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A disadvantage of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> therapy is the fact that a normal diurnal rhythm cannot be truly replicated: at the time of the morning dose, endogenous serum cortisol concentrations would normally already be at or after the circadian peak. This transient early morning adrenal insufficiency probably accounts for the symptoms of fatigue, lassitude, mild nausea, or headache that are often present upon awakening and that are relieved within 30 to 60 minutes after taking the morning dose of hydrocortisone. Some patients find it helpful to take their initial dose of hydrocortisone in the early morning and go back to sleep for a few hours. However, slow-release preparations in development may address this problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>A once-daily dual-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> tablet based on an immediate-release coating combined with an extended-release core is being investigated as an alternative to standard twice or three times daily dosing for patients with adrenal insufficiency. In one report, patients taking the once-daily tablet had a more physiologic serum cortisol profile, and lower body weight and blood pressure when compared with those taking an equivalent dose of hydrocortisone administered as a three times daily regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Long-acting glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Longer-acting agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> provide a smoother physiological effect and avoid the marked changes in serum glucocorticoid levels that occur with short-acting drugs. It is not known if this is clinically important. The usual oral daily replacement doses are 0.5 mg and 5 mg for dexamethasone and prednisone, respectively. Some patients require 2.5 or 7.5 mg for prednisone or 0.25 or 0.75 mg for dexamethasone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64138\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64138 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Long-acting agents may be useful in patients who are non-compliant with multiple daily dose schedules, or in those with severe late-evening or early morning symptoms that are not ameliorated by three-times daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>. Disadvantages of long-acting agents include the variable inter-individual metabolism of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> and, as a result, an inability to predict the correct dose. As a result, patients may be over-treated.</p><p>Obese patients and those who metabolize glucocorticoids more rapidly than average may need higher doses; children or small adults and patients who metabolize glucocorticoids less rapidly than average may need lower doses.

In women with adrenal insufficiency (primary or secondary), we suggest DHEA therapy only for those who have significantly impaired mood or sense of well-being despite optimal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. We typically start with 25 to 50 mg daily for three to six months and adjust the dose based upon the clinical response (improvement in libido, sense of well-being, and androgenic side effects). Adverse effects and biochemical monitoring are discussed separately.</p><p>If no obvious benefit has been seen after six months or if adverse effects occur, we discontinue DHEA. In the United States, this approach is severely limited by the lack of product quality control, as DHEA is considered to be a dietary supplement rather than a hormone preparation.

Replacement of thyroid hormone without replacement of glucocorticoids can precipitate acute adrenal insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hypopituitarism who have partial or total ACTH deficiency and are receiving suboptimal cortisol or cortisone replacement may be at risk of developing symptoms of cortisol deficiency when growth hormone therapy is initiated. This is due to the inhibitory effect of growth hormone on 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, the enzyme that converts cortisone to cortisol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Illness or surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cortisol secretion normally increases with the stress of illness and surgery. This fact has prompted the usual clinical practice of giving higher doses of glucocorticoid to patients with adrenal insufficiency in these situations. Unfortunately, there is little information about how much additional glucocorticoid is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During minor illnesses, such as upper respiratory infections, the patient can increase the dose of glucocorticoid to two to three times the usual daily dose for three days without consulting a clinician (known as the 3 x 3 rule). The increased dose will decrease fever and malaise and will not compromise the immune response. If the illness becomes worse during the three days or if the patient cannot resume the usual maintenance dose on the fourth day, he or she should consult a clinician to determine if other treatment (eg, antibiotics) is indicated.</p><p>As described below, patients with nausea and vomiting who are unable to retain oral medications should have a low threshold for injecting glucocorticoid. Further medical attention should then be sought. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Emergency precautions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appropriate dose and timing of glucocorticoids for patients undergoing surgery is controversial. Early reports of death after surgery led to a recommendation to give glucocorticoids in doses equivalent to 1000 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This is clearly in excess of the increased production of up to 200 mg daily. Prolonged postoperative pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy can mask symptoms and signs of infection and cause undesirable side effects. For example, traditional doses of 300 to 400 mg hydrocortisone for a few days can cause significant hypokalemia and edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The management of the surgical patient taking glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Current recommendations for glucocorticoid supplementation at surgery take into account the severity of the operation and suggest lower daily doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. For minor procedures such as herniorrhaphy, a dose equivalent to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 25 mg is suggested for the day of operation only, with a return to the usual replacement dose on the second day. For moderate surgical stress (eg, cholecystectomy, joint replacement), divided intravenous (IV) doses equivalent to hydrocortisone 50 to 75 mg are suggested on the day of surgery and the first postoperative day, with a return to the usual dose on the second postoperative day (using oral or IV preparation as appropriate). The authors suggest a total daily dose equivalent to 100 to 150 mg hydrocortisone for major surgical procedures (eg, cardiac bypass) given in divided doses for two to three days, then returning to the usual dose. Alternatively, the dose used on the day of surgery can be halved on postoperative day one.

Consequently, the patient must anticipate these situations and be prepared to modify therapy to meet these needs.</p><p>Every patient should wear a medical alert (Medic Alert) bracelet or necklace and carry the Emergency Medical Information Card that is supplied with it.

Patient and family instruction should include the need to get medical help <strong>immediately</strong> after the injection.
