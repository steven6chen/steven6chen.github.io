While our knowledge of these areas is incomplete, a rational plan for management based upon the available evidence is presented here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. </p><p>Secondary MR (also known as functional MR) is caused by left ventricular dysfunction caused by coronary heart disease or by a cardiomyopathy. Secondary MR caused by coronary heart disease (generally with myocardial infarction) is also known as ischemic MR. By contrast, primary MR is caused by primary abnormality of one or more components of the valve apparatus. Identification of the cause and type (primary or secondary) of MR is required for appropriate management of MR and associated conditions. </p><p>The pathophysiology, diagnosis, and evaluation of chronic MR, the management of chronic primary MR, and the management of acute MR are presented elsewhere.

Mitral valve leaflets, chords, and annulus are normal with no or mild MR (small central jet &lt;20 percent of left atrium on color Doppler with vena contracta &lt;0.3 cm). Patients with coronary artery disease have normal or mildly dilated LV size with fixed (myocardial infarction) or inducible (ischemia) regional wall motion abnormalities.

Patients with coronary artery disease have regional wall motion abnormalities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> LV dilation with severe tethering of mitral leaflets and reduced LV systolic function. Patients with cardiomyopathy have LV dilation with associated annular dilation with severe loss of central coaptation of the mitral leaflets and systolic dysfunction. This category includes patients with symptoms due to myocardial ischemia or heart failure that respond favorably to revascularization and medical therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In stage D, patients have symptomatic severe MR (as defined above). Symptoms may include decreased exercise tolerance and exertional dyspnea.

Because of the importance of identifying such a transition, a careful history is important to establish an estimate of baseline exercise tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].

Transthoracic echocardiography usually provides the necessary information. If transthoracic echocardiographic assessment of severity of MR is suboptimal, transesophageal echocardiography may be helpful.</p><p>Regardless of echo-Doppler grading, severe chronic MR is unlikely if there is little or no evidence of left atrial or LV enlargement. In the absence of atrial fibrillation, left atrial size may reflect the &quot;history&quot; (severity and duration) of chronic MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17822868\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING AND EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2690244792\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following initial evaluation and staging, serial monitoring is warranted in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation (MR). The goals of monitoring are to assess changes in clinical status by history and physical examination and to assess changes in left ventricular (LV) function, which can occur in the absence of symptoms, by echocardiography. Secondary MR is often progressive since the regurgitant volume imposes a hemodynamic load on the LV, contributing to dilatation and eccentric geometry that increase the severity of MR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation#H111256161\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Secondary MR'</a>.)</p><p>We agree with the following recommendations for clinical and transthoracic echocardiographic monitoring in asymptomatic patients with chronic MR in the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up of all patients with valve disease includes at least annual history and physical examination. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial transthoracic echocardiography is performed to assess the severity of valve disease, LV ejection fraction, and LV end-systolic dimension. The frequency of recommended follow-up varies with the severity of MR:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with mild MR and no evidence of LV enlargement, LV dysfunction, or pulmonary hypertension should undergo echocardiography every three to five years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with moderate MR should undergo echocardiography every one to two years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with severe MR should be seen every 6 to 12 months (or sooner if symptoms occur).

Evaluation for coronary artery disease may include stress imaging, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (with or without stress), cardiac computed tomography (CT) angiography, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> coronary angiography. </p><p>We generally start the evaluation with a stress imaging test to identify myocardial ischemia and assess viability. Invasive coronary angiography is performed in patients with suspected coronary disease or at risk for coronary disease. Some experts perform coronary CT angiography to exclude coronary artery disease (and proceed with invasive coronary angiography if coronary artery disease is detected) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Coronary revascularization is indicated in patients with standard indications (activity-limiting angina despite maximum medical therapy, significant left main coronary artery disease, or multivessel coronary artery disease with a reduction of LV ejection fraction and a large area of potentially ischemic myocardium), and may also reduce the severity of MR if a large area of stunned or hibernating (ischemic yet viable) myocardium is present.

If these modalities are not locally available, acceptable alternatives are stress radionuclide MPI or stress echocardiography.

TEE also has a role in preoperative and intraoperative evaluation for mitral valve surgery to determine valve anatomy if mitral valve repair is attempted. </p><p>The severity of ischemic MR should be assessed under baseline loading conditions since variations in loading and inotropic state can alter the severity of regurgitation. Intraoperative TEE assessment of MR severity can be misleading because of the LV pressure and volume unloading effects of general anesthesia. The severity of ischemic MR has been observed to decrease after induction of anesthesia with the severity returning to baseline after combined intravenous volume loading to adjust preload and appropriate medications to increase afterload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3034984620\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise testing is not required for routine monitoring of patients with chronic secondary MR but may be helpful in certain settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise stress testing may add objective evidence about symptoms and a change in exercise tolerance; it may be particularly useful if a good history of exercise capacity is difficult to obtain. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with symptoms that are greater than expected for the degree of MR at rest or borderline echocardiographic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], exercise echocardiography including measurement of MR severity and pulmonary artery pressure during exercise, may be helpful.

The supporting evidence primarily comes from small studies as illustrated by the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial, 28 patients with chronic systolic HF (mean LVEF 29 percent) were randomly assigned to increasing doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. All patients had secondary MR with at least 5 cm<sup>2</sup> regurgitant area on color flow Doppler.

The acute effects of CRT on secondary MR were evaluated in a study of 24 patients with biventricular (BiV) pacemakers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The effective regurgitant orifice area was assessed during BiV pacing and with BiV pacing turned off. Active CRT was associated with almost a 50 percent reduction in the effective regurgitant orifice area (25 to 13 mm<sup>2</sup>). Long-term benefits were noted in the CARE-HF and MIRACLE randomized trials of CRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Compared with controls, CRT produced significant reductions in LV end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions and in mitral regurgitant jet area (eg, -2.7 versus -0.5 cm<sup>2</sup> at six months in MIRACLE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>The preceding observations were made in patients with predominantly mild (1+) to moderate (2+) MR.

In the 85 patients surviving to eight-month follow-up, significant improvement in MR (reduction by at least one grade) occurred in 42 patients (49 percent). An ischemic cause of HF was significantly more common in MR nonimprovers than among MR improvers (74 versus 48 percent). Survival rates were higher in MR improvers as compared with MR nonimprovers (97 versus 88 percent at one year and 92 versus 67 percent at two years). MR improvement was an independent predictor of survival (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.13-0.94). The findings suggest a significant benefit from CRT in this population and also highlight the importance of careful patient selection for this treatment, particularly in those with ischemic MR. Lack of response to CRT among patients with ischemic MR may be due to an inability to pace scarred regions. These issues are discussed in detail separately.

However, the results of studies of the impact of mitral valve surgery (generally mitral valve repair) at the time of CABG for patients with ischemic MR have been mixed. Although mitral valve repair at the time of CABG reduces MR compared with CABG alone, it is unclear whether it produces a clinical benefit. </p><p>A randomized trial, as well as some observational studies, found neither symptomatic nor mortality benefit from the addition of mitral valve surgery to CABG compared with CABG alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].

At one- and two-year follow-up, the degree of reverse remodeling (measured as left ventricular [LV] end-systolic volume index), readmission rates, and mortality rates (7.3 versus 6.7 percent at one year; 10.6 versus 10 percent at two years) were similar in the two groups. In the combined procedure group, postoperative moderate or severe MR was less frequent (11.2 versus 32.3 percent in the CABG alone group at two years), but the combined procedure group had a longer bypass time, longer hospital stay after surgery, and more frequent neurologic events and supraventricular arrhythmias than the CABG alone group. Quality-of-life scores improved similarly in the two groups except that the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) was significantly better in the combined procedure group at two years. Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether the reduction in MR leads to a long-term clinical benefit.</p><p>In contrast, two earlier, smaller randomized trials and an observational study suggested a functional benefit from concomitant mitral valve surgery at the time of CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>] and an observational study suggested a survival benefit from the addition of mitral valve repair to CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A randomized trial included 102 patients with moderate (2+) ischemic MR who underwent CABG plus mitral valve repair or CABG alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Mortality rates at five years were not significantly different for the two groups (6.3 versus 11.2 percent), but the functional status of patients undergoing mitral valve repair was significantly better, with fewer patients with New York Heart Association functional class II or greater (15.5 versus 43.7 percent). Similarly, the Randomized Ischemic Mitral Evaluation (RIME) multicenter randomized trial of 73 patients with moderate ischemic MR found that the addition of mitral annuloplasty to CABG did not affect mortality rates but improved functional capacity (peak oxygen consumption) and LV reverse remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1639680605\"><span class=\"h4\">Evidence on isolated mitral surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data are available on the efficacy and safety of isolated mitral valve surgery (without CABG) for secondary MR.

The differences in results may have been caused by greater use of chordal-sparing mitral valve replacement in the trial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by inadequate adjustment for baseline difference in the observational studies. </p><p>The rate of late recurrent MR (moderate or severe) following mitral valve repair is as high as 58.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/41,42,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42,45,46</a>]. Adverse LV remodeling contributes to recurrent MR because ring annuloplasty reduces tethering at the annular but not the ventricular end [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The time course of recurrent MR was illustrated in a review of 585 patients with ischemic MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The rate of moderate to severe MR was 28 percent at six months and remained stable thereafter. Although the rate of recurrent MR was high, the five-year rate of requiring mitral valve replacement was only 3 percent. There are at least three explanations for the low rate of repeat surgery at five years: The degree of MR may have limited importance compared with the underlying cardiovascular disease; almost one-half of patients died within five years, which limited the number of patients in whom reoperation could be performed; and surgeons may be reluctant to perform a repeat operation in this older, high-risk population.</p><p>Preoperative clinical and echocardiographic parameters may help identify patients at greatest risk for recurrent MR. A study of 365 patients undergoing mitral valve repair for ischemic MR found three independent predictors of annuloplasty failure: a larger mitral annular diameter, higher tethering area, and greater MR severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Specific risk factors are associated with worse outcomes in patients undergoing mitral valve repair. A study of mitral valve repair for secondary MR (80 percent ischemic) found that mitral valve coaptation depth and markers of right ventricular dysfunction (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion &le;12 mm and tricuspid annular peak systolic velocity &le;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/second)</span> were predictors of worse early and five-year mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Since scant data are available comparing mitral valve repair and replacement in patients with nonischemic secondary MR, recommendations for such patients are based largely on indirect evidence on patients with ischemic MR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1641529527\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of prosthetic valve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with an indication for mitral valve surgery who undergo valve replacement, the choice of mechanical versus bioprosthetic valve should follow guidelines for valve choice based on patient age, risks of long-term anticoagulation, and patient preferences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F96336\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96336 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Given the limited life expectancy of many patients with secondary MR, it is reasonable to consider a bioprosthetic valve rather than mechanical prosthetic valve when life expectancy is shorter than the expected life-span of a bioprosthetic valve. In addition, preserving the subvalvular apparatus is less technically demanding and associated with fewer valve-related complications when a bioprosthesis is used.

As described above, revascularization is commonly the primary indication for cardiac surgery among patients with ischemic MR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical procedures for severe chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for coronary disease'</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with chronic ischemic MR, an additional rationale for revascularization is the possibility of reducing MR. Observational studies suggest that reperfusion (by primary percutaneous coronary intervention or thrombolysis) in patients with acute inferior or posterior (inferolateral) ST elevation myocardial infarction substantially reduces the incidence of moderate to severe ischemic MR (eg, 2.5 versus 11.1 percent in patients not receiving reperfusion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. Late revascularization is less likely to reduce MR in patients with chronic ischemic MR as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 136 patients with moderate to severe ischemic MR undergoing CABG, 40 percent continued to have moderate to severe (3+ to 4+) MR, 51 percent had some improvement to moderate (2+) MR, and 9 percent had no or mild (0 to 1+) MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative evaluation may help identify patients in whom ischemic MR is likely to improve following CABG. At one-year follow-up of 135 patients with moderate ischemic MR who had undergone CABG, 57 had no or mild MR, 64 patients had no change or worse MR, and 14 had died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The majority (93 percent) of surviving patients with large extent of viable myocardium (&ge;5 segments by single-photon emission computed tomography) and lack of dyssynchrony of segments underlying the papillary muscles showed reduced MR, while only 34 and 18 percent of patients with &lt;5 viable segments and dyssynchrony, respectively, showed improvement in MR. The group with decreased MR also had a marked improvement in LVEF and a decrease in LV volumes, consistent with the mechanism of improvement being reperfusion of viable myocardium.

Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was a predictor of mortality upon univariate but not multivariate analysis and pulmonary artery systolic pressure was not significantly different in the groups with and without evidence of right ventricular systolic dysfunction.</p><p>Ischemic MR following myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with increased mortality as well as risk of development of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/63-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-76</a>]. The degree of mortality risk is illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis from the CADILLAC trial of 1976 patients with an acute ST elevation MI, 192 (10 percent) had mild MR and 58 (3 percent) had moderate to severe MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Patients with worse MR had significantly higher mortality rates at 30 days (1.4, 3.7, and 8.6 percent for no MR, mild MR, and moderate to severe MR, respectively) and at one year (2.9, 8.5, and 20.8 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar increase in risk over the longer term was noted in a prospective study of 303 patients with a previous Q wave MI, 194 of whom had ischemic MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. At five years, those with ischemic MR had a higher rate of cardiac mortality (50 versus 30 percent).
