Trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of extending endocrine therapy to 10 years. In the ABCSG-16 trial, postmenopausal women with nonmetastatic, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who had received four to six years of adjuvant endocrine therapy were randomly assigned to either an additional two or five years of anastrazole as extended adjuvant treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-oncology/abstract/5&amp;token=dvrlBe93JhuCxCDQ5OHigVfq9uVUTQyTC/lWdUy6JWpVrD8HM66gMtJmOr7wU8ZvIW0Jhbpy22SQS03YRxUKF+Wz3cq6HnIBatoZii7cga8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=8361\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">5</a>].

For detection of five cancer types for which no screening tests are available for high-risk patients (ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, and esophagus), sensitivity ranged from 69 to 98 percent, and specificity was above 99 percent.

In an analysis derived from the linked SEER-Medicare database, 72,000 individuals over the age of 65 diagnosed and treated for nonmetastatic CRC between 2000 and 2011 were compared with a matched cohort of Medicare patients without cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-oncology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The 10-year cumulative incidences of new-onset CVD and heart failure were more than twofold higher in patients treated for CRC. Risk increased with age and was influenced by exposure to fluoropyrimidines and preexisting comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. These findings provide evidence to support close medical surveillance for heart failure and CVD in older CRC cancer survivors, particularly those with preexisting hypertension and diabetes.
