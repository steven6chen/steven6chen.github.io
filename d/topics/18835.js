Initially, there was a &quot;hit hard and hit early&quot; approach to treatment, implying that all patients should be treated with combination therapy as soon as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the early 2000s, providers started to withhold therapy in patients with relatively preserved CD4 counts given the toxicity of early ART and the lack of clinical evidence proving a benefit of therapy for those with normal CD4 counts. However, advances in HIV therapy in the last decade have shifted the risk-benefit ratio back to earlier treatment. The standard of care today is to treat essentially all HIV-infected patients with ART. </p><p>This topic will discuss when to initiate ART and will review the evidence supporting early initiation of therapy. The selection of specific medications, patient evaluation, and laboratory monitoring are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27016986\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS OF ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In HIV-infected individuals, antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces mortality as well as serious AIDS- and non-AIDS-related complications. It also prevents transmission of HIV to others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84590843\"><span class=\"h2\">For the patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For HIV-infected patients, ART can result in sustained suppression of HIV RNA. This leads to improvements in cellular immunity (ie, CD4 count), and a subsequent reduction in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. Suppression in HIV RNA can also result in a reduction in HIV-immune activation (eg, proinflammatory cytokines, chronic inflammation, and T-cell activation), which can otherwise lead to end-organ damage (eg, coronary artery disease, liver and kidney disease, neurologic disease, malignancy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The benefits of ART can vary based upon the CD4 count. As an example, the patient's baseline CD4 count can impact treatment outcomes. This was illustrated in a collaborative study of 62,760 treatment-na&iuml;ve patients in Europe and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Over a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, 2039 patients died. Although the overall risk of mortality was reduced by approximately 50 percent among those who initiated ART compared with those who did not, the absolute survival benefit depended upon the patient&rsquo;s level of immunocompromise before treatment. In analyses stratified by CD4 count, the corresponding hazard ratios for all-cause mortality for treated versus untreated patients were: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0.29 for patients with &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (95% CI 0.22-0.37)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0.33 for 100 to 199 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (95% CI 0.25-0.44)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0.38 for 200 to 349 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (95% CI 0.28-0.52) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0.55 for 350 to 499 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (95% CI 0.41-0.74) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0.77 for &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (95% CI 0.58-1.01)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84590462\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with a CD4 count &le;350 cells/microL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is high quality evidence that initiating ART in patients with a CD4 count &le;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> results in a significant decline in the risk of AIDS-related morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-21</a>]. Clinical trials in patients with AIDS (ie, a CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a history of an AIDS-defining illness) have clearly demonstrated that ART improves survival and delays disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/10,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,22</a>]. </p><p>In addition, initiating ART <strong>before</strong> the CD4 count is &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> also reduces mortality in HIV-infected individuals. As an example, in a randomized clinical trial of 816 patients from Haiti, patients who initiated ART treatment when the CD4 count was &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> had a higher mortality rate compared with those who initiated ART when the CD4 count was between 200 to 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (23 versus 6 deaths; hazard ratio 4.0; 95% CI 1.6&ndash;9.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84590482\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with a CD4 count &gt;350 cells/microL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mortality benefit of initiating ART is less clear in patients with a CD4 count &gt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. However, initiating ART in such patients reduces serious AIDS- and non-AIDS-related complications. The best evidence for initiating ART in patients with a CD4 count &gt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> comes from the START and Temprano trials, which are discussed in detail below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

Factors that independently predict death due to non-AIDS events include diabetes, advanced age, and hepatitis <span class=\"nowrap\">B/hepatitis</span> C status. </p><p>ART has resulted in both a decreased incidence of HIV-related comorbid conditions, and an improvement in the outcomes among those who develop disease. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)</strong> &ndash; Initiation of ART has been associated with a dramatic decline in the incidence of HIV-associated nephropathy. In a five-year retrospective study of 4000 HIV-infected patients, the risk of nephropathy was 60 percent lower among patients treated with ART; no cases were reported among patients who began ART prior to progression to AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, ART in patients with HIVAN has been associated with both <span class=\"nowrap\">preserved/improved</span> renal function and prolonged survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan#H5579079\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)&quot;, section on 'ART and HIVAN'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiovascular disease </strong>&ndash; HIV infection itself may accelerate atherosclerosis. In a large trial designed to assess ART-interruption strategies, 2720 patients who were randomly assigned to the treatment interruption arm experienced a higher risk of cardiovascular events compared with 2752 patients on the continuous treatment arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Another study suggested that CD4 counts &lt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> were an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Malignancy</strong> &ndash; With the widespread introduction of ART, the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma and lymphoma has declined. The strongest evidence demonstrating a reduced risk of malignancy from early ART comes from the START study, a randomized trial of 4685 HIV-infected participants who received immediate verus delayed ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In this study, there was a significant reduction in infection-related cancers (ie, those associated with human herpesvirus 8, Epstein-Barr virus, and human papillomavirus) among those receiving early ART (6 versus 23; hazard ratio 0.26: 95% CI &#160;11&ndash;.64) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There was also a nonsignificant decrease in the risk of infection-unrelated cancers (8 versus 16; HR 0.49, 95% CI &#160;21&ndash;1.15). A more detailed description of the START study is found below. (See <a href=\"#H156672\" class=\"local\">'Whom to treat'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinical outcomes of patients with these tumors have also improved with restoration of cellular immunity and viral suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As an example, ART is generally recommended for all patients with AIDS-related Kaposi Sarcoma, and for some, ART may be the only therapy required. In addition, concomitant administration of ART during chemotherapy for AIDS-related lymphoma appears to improve overall survival. Reductions in HIV viral load, and improvements in immune function associated with ART, can also result in an improved ability to tolerate chemotherapy and fewer opportunistic infections.

Progression of liver disease may be slower in such patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C co-infection taking ART. In addition, in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV</span> coinfection, ART is associated with reductions in non-OI-related deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

HIV controllers are the one possible exception. (See <a href=\"#H1188796079\" class=\"local\">'HIV controllers'</a> below.)</p><p>Previous recommendations for delayed ART were heavily influenced by drug toxicities, the potential risk for drug resistance if virologic suppression was not achieved, and limited treatment options for patients who failed therapy. Therapeutic options have expanded, and the available agents are more potent, better tolerated, and associated with less toxicity compared with earlier agents. In addition, simplified regimens have led to improved adherence.

Two large randomized clinical trials have subsequently supported this approach based upon favorable clinical outcomes without an increase in adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The START trial evaluated early versus deferred ART in 4685 treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected men and women with CD4 counts &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> from low, moderate, and high income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Individuals were randomly assigned to early initiation of ART (upon study entry) or delayed initiation (when the CD4 count reached 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span>. After approximately three years of follow-up, an interim analysis found the risk of a combined outcome that included AIDS-related events, serious non-AIDS events (eg, cancer, major cardiovascular, renal, and liver disease), or death was significantly reduced in individuals who received early compared with deferred therapy (1.8 versus 4.1 percent), leading to early termination of the deferred therapy arm. In both study groups, most events occurred when the CD4 count was &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (94 out of 138 events). Compared with the group that was assigned to deferred therapy (median CD4 count 408 at ART initiation), the group that was assigned to early ART (median CD4 count 651 at ART initiation) was significantly less likely to develop serious AIDS (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.50) or non-AIDS (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.97)-related events. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TEMPRANO trial, which evaluated early versus deferred ART initiation (ie, at study entry versus World Health Organization criteria for ART initiation), enrolled 849 HIV-infected individuals from the Ivory Coast who had a CD4 count &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> at study entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In addition, overall mortality was greater among patients without CD4 cell recovery compared with those who achieved a CD4 count &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> after three years of suppressive ART (adjusted HR 2.6, 95%CI 1.86-3.61). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157317\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with HIV-related conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ART should be initiated as soon as possible in patients with comorbid conditions directly resulting from HIV infection (eg, HIV nephropathy, HIV-associated dementia). In addition, therapy should not be delayed in patients with HIV who have non-AIDS-defining conditions associated with early symptomatic HIV infection, such as those described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54622\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54622 \">table 1</a>). For these patients, ART can either reverse the underlying condition or prevent further progression of symptoms.

It is also important for the management of certain infections when specific anti-infective therapy is ineffective or only marginally effective (eg, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, cryptosporidiosis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-cryptosporidiosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of cryptosporidiosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment guidelines recommend initiating ART within two weeks for most OIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/35,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,47,48</a>]. This approach is supported by the findings from a randomized trial where 282 patients presenting with various OIs received &quot;early ART&quot; (initiated within 14 days of presentation) or &quot;late ART&quot; (initiated when OI treatment was completed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Early treatment led to a 50 percent reduction in AIDS-related mortality without any increase in treatment-related adverse events. Clinical trials evaluating the timing of ART in patients with active tuberculosis also demonstrated that early ART led to improved clinical outcomes, with the benefit being strongest in those with advanced immunosuppression. A more detailed discussion of when to initiate ART in patients with tuberculosis is found elsewhere.

In general, initiation of ART should be temporarily delayed in this setting. It is likely that the benefits of early ART in cryptococcal meningitis are outweighed by induction of a potentially serious immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

Treatment results in sustained suppression of HIV RNA, improved cellular immunity (ie, CD4 count), reduced HIV-immune activation (eg, proinflammatory cytokines, chronic inflammation, and T-cell activation), and decreased HIV transmission to others. (See <a href=\"#H27016986\" class=\"local\">'Benefits of antiretroviral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend ART for patients with HIV infection and a detectable viral load, regardless of CD4 count (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). ART has been found to reduce serious AIDS- and non-AIDS-related complications in patients with a CD4 count &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. In addition, there is high quality evidence that initiating ART in patients with a CD4 count &le;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> results in a significant decline in AIDS-related mortality. (See <a href=\"#H156672\" class=\"local\">'Whom to treat'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, we initiate therapy soon after their initial diagnosis. In rare situations, therapy may temporarily delayed in asymptomatic patients with normal CD4 counts who have barriers to taking daily therapy. However, these barriers should be promptly addressed. (See <a href=\"#H9393290\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with advanced HIV disease (eg, CD4 count &le;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> or HIV-related complications, early ART is particularly important as such patients are at increased risk of adverse outcomes due to HIV itself or associated comorbid conditions.
