(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions#H31999074\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;, section on 'Selective photothermolysis'</a>.)</p><p>The basic principles of selective photothermolysis are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-hyperpigmentation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The wavelength of light delivered should be preferentially absorbed by the target molecule (also known as a chromophore)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light must be delivered within a period of time that limits damage to adjacent cutaneous structures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The light energy transferred to the target chromophore must be sufficient to exert the desired therapeutic effect while minimizing damage to adjacent tissue</p><p/><p>Since an excess of melanin in the skin is responsible for the darkened appearance of most cutaneous disorders of hyperpigmentation, melanin frequently is the chromophore targeted during treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2027826747\"><span class=\"h2\">Light wavelength</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strong light absorption by melanin occurs in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum and the molecule's affinity for light decreases progressively as wavelengths rise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F74419\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74419 \">figure 1</a>). Although one might interpret this to mean that lasers that emit ultraviolet light or short wavelengths of visible light would be preferred for the treatment of hyperpigmentation, additional factors such as competition with hemoglobin (a chromophore with peak light absorption between 400 and 600 nm) and the limited depth of penetration of very short wavelengths of light narrow the spectrum of optimal clinical use.</p><p>Thus, the ideal wavelengths of light for absorption by melanin in the skin fall between 600 and 1100 nm. The Q-switched (QS) lasers, nonablative pulsed lasers, and intense pulsed light sources most commonly used for the treatment of cutaneous hyperpigmentation emit wavelengths of light within this range. In contrast, the efficacy of ablative lasers and fractionated lasers for hyperpigmented skin lesions is not based upon melanin as a target chromophore; these lasers target water in the skin. Wavelengths between 1550 and 10,600 nm are strongly absorbed by water and are utilized for ablative and fractional therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions#H31999082\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;, section on 'Wavelength'</a>.)</p><p>With the exception of water-targeting ablative lasers, in which strong absorption of light by water in the skin limits the amount of light transmitted to the dermis, the depth of light penetration into the skin generally increases with increasing laser wavelength. Thus, knowledge of the site of abnormal melanin deposition within the skin is critical for device selection. While some disorders, such as lentigines are characterized by increased melanin in the epidermis, dermal hyperpigmentation is a significant feature in other skin diseases (see <a href=\"#H11132338\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> below). Lasers with relatively short wavelengths (eg, 532 nm frequency doubled QS Nd:YAG lasers) are well suited for the elimination of epidermal melanin, and longer wavelength lasers (eg, 694 nm QS ruby, 755 nm QS alexandrite, and 1064 nm QS neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet [Nd:YAG] lasers) are typically employed for the treatment of lesions in which melanin deposits are deeper. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions#H31999082\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;, section on 'Wavelength'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4137883\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulse duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pulse duration of a device (length of time over which light is delivered) is an additional factor that has a significant impact on the efficacy of treatment. When light emitted from a laser or intense pulsed light device is absorbed by the target chromophore (eg, melanin), a photothermal effect, resulting from the conversion of light energy into heat, leads to the coagulation of the target tissue. The general concept is to heat the target just long enough to damage the target but not so long that the heat spreads out and damages surrounding structures. Smaller objects take less time to heat up than larger objects, so shorter pulse durations are used on smaller objects, and longer pulse durations are used on larger targets. As a rough guide, delivery of light in a period shorter than a target's thermal relaxation time (the time necessary for a target to cool by 50 percent) allows for the destruction of the target while limiting the transfer of heat to adjacent tissues. </p><p>Melanin is the primary pigment in skin and is a very small structure, approximately 1 micron in width. The thermal relaxation time of an individual melanosome varies between 10 and 500 ns; therefore, lasers with very short pulse durations are used to treat most pigmented lesions. The pulse duration of the QS lasers commonly used for the treatment of pigmented lesions are in the nano- and picosecond range.</p><p>Extending the pulse duration can be beneficial for the treatment of larger structures. Because large structures have longer thermal relaxation times and lose heat more slowly than small structures, long pulse durations lead to relatively greater accumulation of heat in large structures. In this way, larger structures (eg, a large nest of pigment-containing nevomelanocytes) can be preferentially destroyed while sparing smaller, unintended targets that also contain melanin or other light-absorbing chromophores. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions#H31999090\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;, section on 'Pulse duration'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to a photothermal effect, lasers can also remove melanin via a photomechanical effect (also referred to as a photoacoustic effect). Very rapid delivery of high energy pulses of light that is highly absorbed by melanin can lead to the creation of shock waves within melanosomes, resulting in melanosome rupture. The QS lasers with nano- and picosecond pulse widths take advantage of this mechanism. (See <a href=\"#H3044579\" class=\"local\">'Q-switched nanosecond lasers'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4137890\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lastly, the fluence (the amount of light energy delivered per unit of space) is a key determinant for achieving the desired clinical effect. Fluence settings that are too low will result in inadequate treatment. Fluence settings that are too high will create excessive heat and can lead to adverse effects, such as dyspigmentation and scarring. Excessive fluence settings are particularly detrimental in individuals with dark skin pigmentation, as permanent hypopigmentation may result from treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions#H31999097\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;, section on 'Fluence'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3044417\"><span class=\"h1\">DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide variety of light-emitting devices are useful for the treatment of pigmented skin lesions. As described above, the wavelength and pulse duration of a particular device are important determinants of the clinical scenarios for which it is most useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3044579\"><span class=\"h2\">Q-switched nanosecond lasers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional Q-switched (QS) lasers deliver exceptionally high energy laser pulses with pulse durations in the nanosecond range. Absorption of light emitted in this fashion by melanin can lead to the removal of melanin via the creation of acoustic shock waves within melanosomes, which breaks up the melanocyte and melanosomes. Q-switched lasers also operate via photothermal effects. (See <a href=\"#H3044410\" class=\"local\">'Principles'</a> above.)</p><p>QS lasers are available in a variety of wavelengths. Commonly used varieties include the 694 nm QS ruby, 755 nm QS alexandrite, 1064 QS Nd:YAG, and 532 nm frequency doubled QS Nd:YAG lasers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1317230398\"><span class=\"h2\">Picosecond lasers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Picosecond lasers are able to deliver an optical pulse duration that is less than 1 nanosecond. A picosecond is one trillionth of a second or 10<sup>-12</sup> seconds. The extremely short pulse duration creates more of a photoacoustic effect than a photothermal effect on targeted tissue. This enables these devices to treat even smaller particles than nanosecond lasers, use much less energy, and confine thermal damage to a much greater degree. Picosecond lasers exist in a variety of wavelengths, including 532 nm, 755 nm, and 1064 nm. As more studies become available and their parameters become optimized, these lasers may become preferred over their Q-switched nanosecond counterparts. In addition, many of the picosecond devices are being fractionated and used to treat benign, superficial hyperpigmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-hyperpigmentation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3044586\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-pulsed lasers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lasers with pulse durations in the millisecond range are also useful for the treatment of pigmented lesions. The relatively slow delivery of light energy facilitates the treatment of larger targets in the skin.

The 10,600 nm carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), 2940 nm erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) and 2790 nm yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG) lasers can be used to ablate pigment-containing skin. Water is the target chromophore for these lasers.

After treatment, the wound-healing response leads to repopulation of the damaged epidermis and dermal remodeling and a normalization of the treated tissue. The efficacy of fractional lasers in hyperpigmented skin disorders is thought to arise from the elimination of epidermal and dermal melanocytes through a compromised dermal-epidermal junction (the &quot;melanin shuttle&quot; hypothesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-hyperpigmentation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Lesion characteristics, baseline skin color, and risk factors for adverse events should be assessed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lesion characteristics </strong>&ndash; Selection of the most appropriate laser device and treatment parameters requires full understanding of the skin disorder, including the depth of pigmentation within the skin, the origin of pigmentation (eg, melanin, iron, foreign body), and size of the target particle. Longer wavelengths are generally used on deeper targets, and shorter pulse durations are preferred on smaller targets.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Depending on the disorder, excess pigment may reside in the epidermis, papillary dermis, or reticular dermis. The laser selected must be of an appropriate wavelength to reach the site of pigmentation. In melasma, which may present with epidermal or dermal pigment deposition, examination with a Wood's lamp prior to treatment can be useful for estimating the depth of pigmentation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melasma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Melasma&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>). A small (eg, 2 mm) punch biopsy can also be helpful for determining the location of pigment, but is typically avoided due to scarring. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient skin color </strong>&ndash; Because melanin is frequently used as the target chromophore in the treatment of cutaneous hyperpigmentation, the normal distribution of melanin in the epidermis may be adversely affected during treatment. This risk is greatest when epidermal melanin is in abundance, such as in individuals with baseline dark skin pigmentation (eg, Fitzpatrick skin phototype IV to VI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>)) and even more so in tanned skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, treatment with lasers that target melanin in skin should be avoided until a tan fades completely. For individuals with dark baseline skin pigmentation, additional caution is necessary. Treatment of a small, inconspicuous area (a test spot) prior to treatment of a larger area is recommended. In addition, lower fluence settings and lasers with longer wavelengths (eg, 1064 nm QS Nd:YAG) are generally preferred, as they minimize damage to epidermal pigment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk for adverse outcomes </strong>&ndash; The risk of treatment-induced scarring should be discussed thoroughly with all patients, particularly those with a history of keloidal or hypertrophic scar formation. In addition, laser therapy should not be performed for at least six months after treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a> due to a possible increased risk for poor wound healing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Treatment with QS lasers should be avoided in patients with a history of parenteral gold therapy, as localized chrysiasis, manifesting as permanent skin discoloration may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-hyperpigmentation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Possibility for melanocytic atypia </strong>&ndash; Benign and atypical melanocytic lesions cannot always be easily distinguished on clinical examination.

Various clinical subtypes exist, including solar lentigines, lentigo simplex, and labial melanotic macules. Lentigines may also occur in association with genetic syndromes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-pigmented-skin-lesions-other-than-melanocytic-nevi-moles#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign pigmented skin lesions other than melanocytic nevi (moles)&quot;, section on 'Lentigo'</a>.)</p><p>Lentigines sit at the surface of the skin, and, therefore, multiple lasers are effective for the treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-hyperpigmentation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Continuous wave carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and argon lasers ablate the entire epidermis and were among the initial lasers used for pigment disorders. These devices are no longer used due to an unacceptably high risk for adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-hyperpigmentation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Due to the superficial location of pigment in lentigines (epidermis), lasers with relatively short wavelengths are well suited for treatment. </p><p>Q-switched (QS) nanosecond lasers are frequently employed for the treatment of lentigines. The 694 nm QS ruby, 755 nm QS alexandrite, and 532 nm frequency-doubled QS Nd:YAG lasers have yielded excellent results. Treatment with a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser was superior to liquid nitrogen cryotherapy in a small randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-hyperpigmentation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and benefit of QS lasers has been documented in small case series and uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-hyperpigmentation/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. Complete clearing of lesions can often be attained with two to three treatments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75757%7EDERM%2F55782\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75757 graphicRef55782 \">picture 2A-B</a>). </p><p>Fractionated picosecond devices (diffractive lens array) have also been used effectively in the treatment of benign epidermal pigmentation in all skin types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-hyperpigmentation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] with minimal to no significant downtime. With a diffractive lens, 10 percent of the surface area receives 70 percent of the energy, which creates a tiny, plasma-type reaction in the epidermis or superficial dermis. This in turn induces new collagen and elastin production and improves photodamaged skin.</p><p>In our experience, lentigines rarely recur after complete clearance.

Unlike QS lasers, which are utilized to target individual lentigines, these devices can be utilized to treat large areas, such as an entire cosmetic unit or the entire face, and offer an excellent option for patients with diffuse lentigines of the face. </p><p>Fractionated lasers offer another excellent option for the treatment of dyschromia related to cutaneous photodamage, in which solar lentigines are often a prominent manifestation. An uncontrolled study of 50 patients with facial and nonfacial signs of photodamage (including dyspigmentation) found improvement in photodamage following three treatment sessions with a 1550 nm erbium-doped fractionated laser (six to eight passes, 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>,</span> 250 MTZs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-hyperpigmentation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, the subsequently developed 1927 thulium fiber fractionated laser, which has a higher affinity for water than the 1550 nm fractionated laser, is an excellent option for the treatment of lentigines, particularly in patients looking for improvement in skin texture as well. In an uncontrolled study of nine patients with nonfacial photodamage treated with this laser, lentigines were significantly improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-hyperpigmentation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>In 2010, a consensus panel of experts released recommendations for the use of the 1550 nm erbium-doped fractionated laser that included a protocol for the treatment of lentigines.

In addition, application of metal eye shields to the eyes of patients is recommended during the treatment of periocular areas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fire prevention </strong>&ndash; To prevent accidental fires, complete removal of flammable products (makeup, creams, and topical anesthetics) should be performed prior to treatment and the treatment site must be free of alcohol residue. In addition, care should be taken to remove any drapes, towels, plastics, or clothing from the treatment area to prevent accidental ignition. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3044471\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients treated with lasers for pigmented lesions in limited areas do not require anesthesia. The level of discomfort during treatment with QS lasers is often likened to a rubber band snapping against the skin surface. </p><p>Factors that can determine the need for anesthesia include the size of the lesion, anatomical location, depth of pigment, type of laser device, and the patient's pain threshold. Children, patients with lesions characterized by a large amount of dermal pigment (eg, Nevus of Ota), and patients treated with fractionated laser devices often require some form of anesthesia. </p><p>Topical anesthesia with agents, such as topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 5% cream (LMX-5), are the most commonly used anesthetic agents in laser therapy. Occasionally, infiltrative anesthesia, regional nerve blocks, and oral or intramuscular sedation are used. The need for general anesthesia is primarily limited to children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11132382\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE AND COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expected side effects of treatment vary with treatment type. Sensations of pain or stinging are common immediately after laser treatment. Postoperative use of ice packs, cool compresses and occlusive dressings can reduce these symptoms. </p><p>With the use of QS lasers, immediate skin whitening is the appropriate treatment endpoint, and typically fades within 20 to 30 minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69289\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69289 \">picture 9</a>). Treated lesions subsequently become darker and form superficial crusts that fall off in 7 to 10 days. Daily application of occlusive ointments and gentle cleansing of treated areas with soap and water optimizes the healing process and allows crusts to slough on their own. </p><p>In some patients, urticarial reactions can develop following QS and picosecond laser treatment, presenting with edema, itching, and stinging. If these symptoms do not subside within an hour, oral antihistamines may be administered. </p><p>Blistering, bruising, dyspigmentation, and scarring are complications that may occur as a result of treatment with lasers or intense pulsed light. Greater detail on the adverse effects of treatment with pulsed and ablative fractional lasers is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation#H832338\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ablative laser resurfacing for skin rejuvenation&quot;, section on 'Traditional ablative lasers'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation#H7559191\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ablative laser resurfacing for skin rejuvenation&quot;, section on 'Ablative fractional lasers'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions#H368860500\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions&quot;, section on 'Precautions'</a>.)</p><p>Since treatment-induced hyperpigmentation is a risk of laser and intense pulsed light therapy, patients should be instructed to engage in sun-protective practices, including the daily use of sunscreen after treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11132389\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser and intense pulsed light therapy can be effective for the treatment of a wide variety of hyperpigmented skin lesions. A thorough understanding of laser principles and the characteristics of the lesion to be treated is essential for the effective and safe use of light-based therapies. (See <a href=\"#H3044410\" class=\"local\">'Principles'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11132338\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different classes of light-emitting devices, including Q-switched nanosecond lasers, picosecond lasers, long-pulsed lasers, traditional ablative lasers, fractionated lasers, and intense pulsed light are used for the treatment of pigmented lesions. The wavelength, pulse duration, energy setting, and mode of light delivery determine the effects of a device on tissue. (See <a href=\"#H3044417\" class=\"local\">'Devices'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be carefully evaluated prior to laser or intense pulsed light therapy for hyperpigmented skin lesions. Factors that influence the efficacy and safety of treatment such as specific lesion characteristics, patient skin color, and risk factors for adverse events should be assessed. In addition, patients should be well informed of the possible treatment outcomes and potential adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H11132308\" class=\"local\">'Patient evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11132382\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care and complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of eye injury and accidental fire is an important component of the safe administration of laser therapy. All individuals in the treatment room must wear protective eyewear and flammable substances or products should be removed from the treatment site. (See <a href=\"#H3044464\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-hyperpigmentation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Anderson RR, Parrish JA.
