It can result from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill or eject blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Systolic HF is characterized by increased ventricular volume and reduced ejection fraction (EF). The most common causes of systolic HF are ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. Diastolic HF is a clinical syndrome in which patients have symptoms and signs of HF with evidence of diastolic dysfunction (eg, abnormal pattern of left ventricular [LV] filling and elevated filling pressures), but normal or near normal LVEF and LV volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Causes of diastolic HF include ischemic heart disease, hypertension, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Many HF patients have both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Acute decompensated HF may be precipitated by myocardial ischemia or infarction, worsening of cardiac valve dysfunction, atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias, cardiotoxic agents, stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy, or rapid progression of underlying chronic HF. Noncardiac precipitants include severe hypertension, renal failure, and pulmonary emboli. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute decompensated heart failure in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-general-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>&quot;Flash&quot; pulmonary edema is a dramatic form of acute decompensated HF that may develop in susceptible patients in certain clinical settings (eg, hypertensive crisis, acute onset of severe myocardial ischemia or cardiac valve regurgitation).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17304298\"><span class=\"h1\">PREANESTHESIA CONSULTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80300687\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Goals of the preanesthetic consultation include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluating the severity and stability of symptoms in patients with known chronic heart failure (HF).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identifying patients with unsuspected HF by careful history and physical examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessing the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with HF.</p><p/><p>Patients with HF are at increased risk for mortality and hospital readmission after all surgical procedures, including minor interventions, compared to those diagnosed with coronary artery disease without HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of HF include: decreased exercise tolerance, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, cough, orthopnea, peripheral edema, and nocturia. Assessing exercise capacity by asking patients about the number of blocks they can walk and the number of stairs they can climb is an inexpensive way to stratify risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Poor exercise tolerance is defined as the inability to walk at least four blocks or climb two flights of stairs without having to pause. Worsening exercise tolerance or recent use of additional pillows in order to sleep without dyspnea may indicate progression of disease.</p><p>Lack of HF symptoms is not necessarily reassuring. Asymptomatic patients with known HF, and those with unsuspected HF, have often made behavioral adjustments to minimize their symptoms. However, clinical manifestations may develop in these patients with the stress of surgery. Therefore, it is important to evaluate all patients for a prior diagnosis of HF (eg, ischemic cardiomyopathy, idiopathic [nonischemic] dilated cardiomyopathy, familial cardiomyopathy) and known risk factors for HF (eg, atherosclerotic disease, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, drug or alcohol toxicity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Physical examination in patients with HF may reveal a third heart sound (S3), elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, ascites, rales, wheezing, diminished breath sounds, and a laterally-displaced apical impulse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

However, in patients with symptoms or signs of new or worsening HF, echocardiography may be useful to establish the etiology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Furthermore, echocardiographic quantification of the severity of both systolic and diastolic dysfunction may guide perioperative management in patients with symptomatic HF. For example, if severe systolic dysfunction is identified, then inotropic therapy might be preferable to fluid administration for ensuring end-organ perfusion, and anesthetic agents causing myocardial depression might be avoided or administered in low doses. If severe diastolic dysfunction in a small non-compliant LV is identified, then it is important to maintain adequate preload.

In patients with acute decompensated HF, external <span class=\"nowrap\">defibrillation/pacing</span> pads should be placed, since defibrillation, cardioversion, or pacing may become necessary. Management of specific cardiac arrhythmias is the same as in patients in other settings and is discussed in detail separately.

In patients who are hemodynamically unstable (eg, myocardial ischemia, hypotension, pulmonary edema) due to atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, treatment options include IV rate control medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardioversion. Often, management of atrial fibrillation in hemodynamically stable patients may be accomplished with ventricular rate control, using short-acting drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>. However, if the atrial fibrillation is associated with hypotension or evidence of cardiogenic shock, or is clearly the cause of pulmonary edema, immediate cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm may be necessary.

It is designed to pump a large volume of blood against a small pressure gradient.
