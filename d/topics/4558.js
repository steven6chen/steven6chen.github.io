The endothelium is the layer of cells that lines these blood vessels. This layer maintains blood vessel (vascular) tone, regulates hemostasis, acts as barrier to potentially toxic materials, and regulates inflammation. Notably, the metabolic regulation of coronary blood flow that takes place at the site of resistance vessels allows a perfect matching between oxygen supply and demand. The increase of blood flow in the presence of an increase of oxygen demand is mainly mediated by the release of tiny amounts of free oxygen radicals. </p><p>Endothelial dysfunction is the inability of the endothelium to optimally perform one or more of these functions. Dysfunction of the endothelium is the principal determinant of chronic microvascular dysfunction but also may occur in the larger conduit arteries, especially when atherosclerosis is present. The principal clinical consequence of microcirculatory dysfunction is myocardial ischemia but can also include vascular thrombosis, increased vascular permeability, and diastolic changes in the myocardium. Endothelial dysfunction plays a key role in determining myocardial ischemia in all clinical manifestations of ischemic heart disease. Furthermore, the decrement in the noninvasive measurement of peripheral endothelial function has been shown in a large systematic review and meta-analysis encompassing over 17,000 patients to double the cardiovascular risk in moderate-risk individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will focus on basic concepts of normal endothelial function and dysfunction. More clinical aspects are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery endothelial dysfunction: Clinical aspects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359033407\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endothelium is one of the largest organs in the body and it interacts with nearly every other organ or organ system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. It is a single (mono) layer of cells serving multiple purposes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of hemostasis, the balance between thrombosis and clotting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of optimal vascular permeability</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulation of inflammation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of optimal vascular tone, by controlling vasoconstriction and vasodilation; adequate end organ blood perfusion is maintained in this way.</p><p/><p>With regard to this last function, the endothelium functions to maintain the vessel in a relatively neutral state, favoring dilatation over constriction under basal conditions. It has the capacity to respond to various stimuli, including shear stress, temperature, and transmural pressure, as well as external stimuli such as temperature, mental stress, neurohumoral responses, and medications among others. The control of local vascular tone is mediated principally by nitric oxide (NO), although prostacyclin and endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization factor play an important role in atherosclerotic arteries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359035396\"><span class=\"h2\">Nitric oxide generation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endothelial-dependent response of vasodilation is principally regulated by release of NO from endothelial cells. It is synthesized from the amino acid L-arginine by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which leads to the production of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>NO, a molecular gas, is enzymatically formed from L-arginine by three isoforms of NOS: neuronal-type (nNOS, NOS1), cytokine-inducible or macrophage NOS (iNOS, NOS2), and the endothelial-type (eNOS, NOS3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. All three enzymes, which are cytochrome P450-like proteins, facilitate the addition of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guanidine</a> nitrogen of the amino acid arginine to molecular oxygen, producing NO and water. These enzymes differ markedly in their localization and function. Many cell types, most notably endothelial cells, constitutively express eNOS, generating relatively low levels of NO that are under tight control by regulatory factors. In contrast, iNOS is normally not expressed, but when induced by inflammatory cytokines, can generate large amounts of NO far in excess of those made by eNOS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359037870\"><span class=\"h2\">Nitric oxide function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NO is a paracrine mediator that works differently from endocrine mediators, such as angiotensin II and antidiuretic hormone. NO, which is produced and released by individual cells, readily penetrates the biological membranes of neighboring cells, modulating a number of signaling cascades. Since it has an extremely short half-life, it exerts its effects locally and transiently.</p><p>The most recognized cellular target of NO is heme-containing soluble guanylate cyclase. The stimulation of this compound enhances the synthesis of cyclic GMP (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate, increasing the cytosolic levels of cGMP. The effects of NO can be enhanced by inhibiting the breakdown of cGMP, a process catalyzed by a family of phosphodiesterases.</p><p>Other cellular targets for NO also exist:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NO interacts with thiol groups on proteins and small molecules, resulting in the formation of S-nitrosothiols. The addition and removal of S-nitrosothiols is a highly regulated process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NO can target <span class=\"nowrap\">Fe/S</span> groups at the catalytic centers of proteins, including hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The formation of peroxynitrite from NO and superoxide radical, which occurs when large amounts of NO are generated, typically by iNOS, has been implicated in cellular toxicity via the propensity of peroxynitrite to induce post-translational changes in the tyrosine residues of proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359037876\"><span class=\"h3\">Biologic effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biologic effects of NO depend upon the concentration of NO produced as well as features specific to the local environment, particularly the presence and production of thiols and superoxide. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359037889\"><span class=\"h4\">Vasodilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NO exerts its vasodilatory effects through stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase.

NO is a physiologic inhibitor of smooth muscle growth. The effect of NO on vascular smooth muscle growth is mediated by cGMP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. In addition to inhibiting smooth muscle growth, NO may also promote apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H277791737\"><span class=\"h4\">Endothelial cell proliferation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While NO and other cyclic GMP-activating agents inhibit the growth of vascular smooth muscle, they do not alter the rate of growth of endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. On the other hand, proliferating cells (eg, following endothelial denudation) express about sixfold as much eNOS mRNA as confluent cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The net effect is that proliferating endothelial cells that grow back to recover exposed intima produce large amounts of NO; the NO will tend to minimize platelet adhesion and vascular smooth muscle proliferation in the area but will not interfere with the endothelial cell proliferation. &#160;</p><p>New vessel growth involves several distinct steps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased vascular permeability and dissolution of the bond between the endothelium and basement membrane</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migration and reattachment of endothelial cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and the formation of a tubule, which is the rudimentary vascular structure.</p><p/><p>Almost universally, pathologic conditions that can lead to angiogenesis, such as tissue hypoxia and inflammation, are associated with the production and release of growth factors, suggesting that these substances are critical to the formation of new blood vessels. In addition, the respective growth factor receptors must be upregulated and inhibitory factors must be inhibited if the growth factors are to play a role in the initiation and later steps of vessel development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-collateral-circulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary collateral circulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is also a strong relation between the release of NO and the regulation of blood vessel growth and development. Substance P and growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), all of which stimulate the release of NO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/13,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,16</a>], induce new vessel formation in vivo and increase the permeability, migration, and proliferation of post-capillary endothelial cells in tissue culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. On the other hand, inhibitors of NO synthase suppress angiogenesis, and the proliferative effect of VEGF.</p><p>There are, however, contradictory observations concerning the role of NO in angiogenesis. In different models, NO synthase was involved in angiogenesis induced by VEGF but not that induced by FGF-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and, paradoxically, angiogenesis was inhibited by the NO donor sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> and the NO synthase substrate L-arginine, and increased by inhibitors of NO synthase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. It is possible that the effects of NO differ between species and between vascular beds within species.</p><p>In contrast to the robust angiogenic response seen in many animal models of chronic myocardial ischemia, the angiogenic effects of exogenously delivered growth factors, such as FGF-2 and VEGF, have been relatively modest or negative in human trials, especially when given intravascularly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This difference could be related to a diminished response to angiogenic growth factors in the setting of atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and other causes of endothelial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In addition, the expression of pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, may be diminished and the expression of anti-angiogenic factors, such as endostatin and angiostatin, may be increased in conditions such as hypercholesterolemia and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. This may negatively affect both microvascular and macrovascular collateral growth in response to chronic coronary artery occlusion, and thus may affect overall myocardial perfusion.</p><p>The diminished potential of angiogenic growth factors to induce collateral development may have adverse implications for the use of gene-, protein- and, cell-based therapies to increase perfusion to ischemic myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. It is possible that adjunctive therapies such as statins and NOS substrate (L-arginine) may improve the angiogenic potential of these growth factors as a therapeutic modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, the role of statins in collateral growth is biphasic, and some studies have suggested that statins may not necessarily improve collateral development and may actually diminish perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Other factors also play a role, including abnormal autonomic regulation of vascular tone, changes in vascular smooth muscle reactivity, altered voltage-gated K+ channel function, and impaired vasodilatory response to hypoxia, which may have significant implications for the metabolic regulation of blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359038804\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal cause of endothelial dysfunction is an imbalance in nitric oxide (NO) production and consumption, favoring consumption and reduced production. The major consequence is inability of the vessel to properly dilate. The principal clinical manifestation of endothelial dysfunction in the coronary circulation is myocardial ischemia. When NO-mediated vasodilation is compromised, the vasodilatory response is thought to be facilitated by cytochrome-derived factors, natriuretic peptide, and prostacyclin.</p><p>In addition, endothelial dysfunction creates conditions favorable for platelet plus leukocyte activation and adhesion, as well as the activation of cytokines that increase the permeability of the vessel wall to oxidized lipoproteins and inflammation mediators, finally resulting in structural damage of the arterial wall with smooth muscle cell proliferation and atherosclerotic plaque formation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359035633\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal nitric oxide metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biochemical causes of abnormal NO metabolism, which contribute to endothelial dysfunction through decreased production <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased consumption of NO, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High oxidative stress and inflammation lead to abnormal NO metabolism (bioavailability, <span class=\"nowrap\">use/response,</span> production, release, and degradation), which can be exacerbated with other conditions (cold, mental stress, anger) that are known to produce a global vasoconstriction. Increased oxidative stress is characterized by a measurable increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can result from impaired NO synthase, decreased L-arginine uptake, increased oxidized low density lipoprotein cholesterol (Ox-LDL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], or reduced superoxide dismutase, an enzyme pivotal in the clearing of ROS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Hyperlipidemia is known to increase ROS, which will reduce the bioavailability of NO; it can be ameliorated with correction of hyperlipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decrease in tetrahydrobiopterin (THB), which is a co-factor for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

EPCs may also be involved in the regeneration of ischemic myocardium by modulation of angiogenesis and myogenesis, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and remodeling in the ischemic cardiac tissue. EPCs have additionally been reported to participate in cerebral neovascularization after ischemic stroke. The significance of the role of EPCs in early vascular injury and repair was underscored by a report demonstrating a significant correlation between the number and the function of EPCs and peripheral endothelial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The assessment of the number and the function of EPCs may serve as an important additional marker of endothelial function and accordingly can serve as a marker for therapy.

These animals developed impaired vasodilation, and in some cases paradoxical constrictions, in larger vessels in response to acetylcholine, bradykinin, and thrombin. Impaired vasodilation was also seen in the coronary microvasculature, where overt atherosclerosis does not develop. Similar findings have been made in other animal models of diet-induced atherosclerosis.</p><p>In atherosclerosis, the serotonin 1B receptor is upregulated and serotonin produces augmented vasoconstriction, a result of calcium mobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].
