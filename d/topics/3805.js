However, evidence is lacking to support routine screening in individuals with these risk factors.</p><p>A multivariate risk formulation to identify individuals at risk for development of HF was devised based upon data from the Framingham Heart Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-asymptomatic-left-ventricular-systolic-dysfunction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, the prognostic value of this risk profile has not been validated in other populations and the efficacy of management based upon this risk profile has not been determined. The risk profile ingredients can be obtained by routine office procedures: an ECG to assess for criteria for LV hypertrophy, resting heart rate, blood pressure determination, weight, vital capacity, presence of significant heart murmurs, and evidence of coronary disease, cardiomegaly, or diabetes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70632%7ECARD%2F50666\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70632 graphicRef50666 \">table 2A-B</a>). Using this risk profile, it was possible to identify 20 percent of the susceptible population from whom 60 to 73 percent of cases of HF will arise. Those in the upper quintile of multivariate risk appear to be good candidates for both diagnostic procedures and vigorous preventive measures, but further data are needed to determine the efficacy of this approach. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1995523519\"><span class=\"h3\">No routine screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not perform routine screening in unselected adults with echocardiography <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> natriuretic peptides for ALVSD since the efficacy of such an approach has not been established.</p><p>Echocardiography is expensive and serial testing would be required if the initial test is negative.

However, the results with these measurements are not sufficiently predictive and the values used as a trigger for echocardiography have not been well defined.</p><p>Another problem is that the rationale for screening (that effective therapy initiated when the patient is asymptomatic improves outcomes) is only proven for patients in whom the LVEF is &le;35 to 40 percent; this level of ALVSD is rare (approximately in 1 percent in adults 50 to 70 years old; lower in those without risk factors). Asymptomatic mild LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF 41 to 54 percent) is much more common but the efficacy of therapy in these patients is not known.

Other alternative imaging modalities include nuclear imaging (eg, radionuclide ventriculography) and cardiac computed tomography.

Care must be taken to avoid missing the diagnosis of clinical HF, particularly in patients with insidious onset of symptoms. On the other hand, some patients with symptoms and signs typical for HF do not have HF (eg, patients with dyspnea due to deconditioning) and thus may have ALVSD.

As an example, suboptimal acoustic windows may cause an echocardiographic appearance of low LVEF in a patients with normal LV systolic function. In some such cases, improvement of endocardial border detection using contrast echocardiography is sufficient to provide more accurate LVEF assessment. As an example, in a study of 632 patients with technically difficult echocardiographic studies, the percentage of patients categorized has having an LVEF &gt;50 percent increased from 65.2 percent without contrast to 73.9 percent with contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-asymptomatic-left-ventricular-systolic-dysfunction/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].
