Complications that occur during or following intubation and ETT placement are discussed in detail separately.

Daily care includes monitoring ETT cuff pressure, oral and endotracheal suctioning of secretions, and vigilant inspection to ensure that the ETT is rotated regularly and its position maintained. These preventative measures are especially important in those identified as having a difficult airway since reintubation is particularly risky and challenging in this population. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintain optimal cuff pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ETT cuff provides a seal between the ETT and the tracheal wall to ensure accurate delivery of tidal volumes during mechanical ventilation. Overinflation of the cuff can result in tissue ischemia, ulceration, and necrosis of the tracheal wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F110010\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef110010 \">image 1</a>) while underinflation results in the leak of air and oropharyngeal secretions around the ETT cuff which predisposes the patient to inadequate ventilation, de-recruitment, and aspiration pneumonia, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, setting a cuff pressure that ensures adequate ventilation while concurrently avoiding leak requires careful balance. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laryngeal injury'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4140199796\" class=\"local\">'Endotracheal cuff leaks'</a> below.)</p><p>Cuff pressures should be monitored routinely in patients who are intubated. The frequency of cuff pressure checks is institution-specific but typically performed daily, at minimum. There are several factors that can affect cuff pressure including tracheal size, ETT size, ventilatory pressures and patient position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, there is no single cuff pressure that is ideal for every patient. However, as a general guideline, the cuff pressure should be maintained between 20 and 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Occasionally, individual adjustment <strong>within</strong> these parameters is needed. As an example, a lower pressure may be sufficient in patients with a small airway diameter who have a large ETT in place. In contrast, higher cuff pressure is sometimes required to prevent significant air leak that can occur in patients with high peak airway pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; however, a small air leak at high ventilatory pressures may be tolerated without a need to increase cuff pressure beyond the set limit, provided gas exchange is acceptable. </p><p>Special caution is necessary when a patient is transported to a different altitude. Cuff pressure will increase when the patient is moved to a higher altitude because air expands within the cuff. The change of cuff pressure can be large; in one study, the mean rise in cuff pressure was 23 cm H<sub>2</sub>O when patients moved from sea level to a height of at least 3000 feet above sea level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, it is prudent to measure cuff pressure after transport to a different altitude and adjust cuff volume accordingly.</p><p>ETT cuffs are categorized as being high volume, low pressure (HVLP) cuffs or low volume, low pressure (LVLP) cuffs. Most ICUs use ETTs with HVLP cuffs. ETTs with HVLP cuffs that can automatically set the cuff pressure are commercially available but have not been shown to be associated with a significant clinical benefit when compared with manual measurement, such that they are not generally used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Similarly, although leaks from the subglottic space to the tracheobronchial tree may be lower with LVLP cuffs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], clinical trials demonstrating convincing improvement in important clinical outcomes (eg, rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]) are necessary before ETTs with LVLP cuffs can become routinely used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Suctioning and oral care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suctioning and oral care is an important part of preventing ETT-associated infections and mucus plugging:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ETT suctioning</strong> &ndash; Since patients who are intubated cannot cough and clear their own lower airway secretions, patients should be suctioned regularly via the ETT using a sterile technique which has a sealed system that minimizes nosocomial contamination (&quot;in-line&quot; suctioning) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The optimal frequency of suctioning depends on the quantity of secretions. The cross sectional area of the ETT will inevitably decrease over time because secretions and cellular debris collect within the lumen despite suctioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oropharyngeal suctioning</strong> &ndash; Since oral and nasal secretions collect posteriorly in supine patients in whom the swallowing and cough reflex is impaired due to the ETT, regular oropharyngeal suctioning is also required. This is generally done manually with a Yankauer oral suction catheter. ETTs that provide continuous subglottic secretion drainage via an in-line port located just above the upper level of the cuff are also commercially available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68552\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68552 \">figure 1</a>). Although they have been shown in small trials to possibly decrease the incidence of VAP, methodologic flaws in many of the studies prevent definitive conclusions such that their routine use has not become widespread. These data are discussed separately.

The role of oral decontamination in the prevention of VAP is discussed separately.

Occasionally, the tape needs to be replaced when it loses its adhesive properties (eg, excessive sweating or drooling). </p><p>The ETT should also be rotated from side to side daily to avoid pressure-induced ulceration at the lip, face, and cheek; however, the constant re-taping can weaken the stability of the ETT and can also result in skin tears in those with fragile skin. </p><p>Some experts use commercially available securement devices (ETT &quot;holders&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F110011\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110011 \">picture 1</a>) that mechanically secure the ETT in place without the use of tape, although some ICUs use both tape and ETT holders in those considered high risk of displacement. With some of these devices, the ETT exits the mouth centrally while others have a mechanism that can facilitate side to side rotation without compromising the ETT position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. There is no convincing evidence that ETT holding devices lower the rate of displacement or pressure ulceration, further details of which are discussed below.

Thus, the ETT position should be reassessed regularly. This is typically achieved with daily clinical monitoring of the ETT position by healthcare staff and periodic surveillance chest radiography. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The position of the ETT at the level of the lip should be formally checked by healthcare staff during daily routine assessments as well as following periods of care that are high risk for ETT displacement (eg, turning and transport). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily chest radiographs on mechanically ventilated patients (to check ETT position as well as other endpoints) are routine in many clinical centers; however, we and others believe that this practice is not necessary and that it is appropriate that chest radiographs only be performed when a clinical change such as ETT migration is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In support, randomized trials indicate that a more restrictive approach (eg, chest radiographs only in response to a change in clinical condition) decreases the number of chest radiographs without worsening clinical outcomes, such as mortality, length of ICU stay, or duration of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Comparison of the position of the distal tip of the ETT on chest radiography is optimal when the position of the patient's head is similar on each radiograph; specifically, neck flexion advances the endotracheal tube toward the carina, while neck extension moves the tube away from the carina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68470\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68470 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. The tip of the ETT should be in the trachea, approximately 3 to 5 cm from the carina. </p><p/><p>Evidence of migration should prompt chest radiography and repositioning when necessary, the details of which are discussed below.

We and other experts believe that clear identification of this group (eg, color-coded signs in the room) is prudent since it alerts care givers to being extra vigilant regarding ETT safety and prompt rapid consultation of an expert in difficult airway management in the event that it is needed for an ETT-related complication, thereby avoiding multiple failed attempts at reintubation.

It encompasses several disorders including laryngeal inflammation and edema as well as vocal cord ulceration, granulomas, paralysis, and stenosis. The pathogenesis likely relates to direct pressure and inflammation induced by the ETT on the larynx and surrounding tissue. Direct visualization of the vocal cords is typically required for diagnosis (usually laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy) and should be prompted when symptoms don't resolve following extubation or in those in whom a suspected condition is responsible for extubation failure, or failure to wean from mechanical ventilation. Most conditions associated with laryngeal injury heal spontaneously and symptomatic therapy may be administered while recovery is pending (eg, corticosteroids for edema, vocal cord injection for paralysis, speech training for dysphonia). Others require targeted therapy (eg, granuloma resection) which is discussed in the individual sections below.

Other injuries (eg, bilateral vocal cord paralysis, severe edema, severe laryngotracheal stenosis) can also be associated with extubation failure presenting with acute stridor or respiratory failure after extubation. As an example in a case series of 136 patients, 12 percent of the patients exhibited extubation failure within 48 hours, half of whom had stridor. However, only half of the patients with stridor required reintubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Others, usually those with a tracheostomy in place, may present <strong>prior</strong> to extubation with signs and symptoms consistent with failure to wean from mechanical ventilation exhibited by an inability to tolerate a speech valve or inability to undergo prolonged spontaneous breathing trials (eg, tracheal stenosis).

Distinguishing these from one another can be done by clinical and assessment of the patient, the ventilator, the ETT position and <span class=\"nowrap\">cuff/inflation</span> system, and chest radiography. When the <span class=\"nowrap\">cuff/inflation</span> system is compromised, definitive management is replacement of the ETT. If the <span class=\"nowrap\">cuff/inflation</span> system is intact, the ETT may need an adjustment (eg, ETT repositioning, increased cuff volume, reducing peak pressures). (See <a href=\"#H4140199796\" class=\"local\">'Endotracheal cuff leaks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteria enmeshed in a biofilm can adhere to the inner surface of the ETT within hours of intubation which may contribute to both ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP; also known as infection-related ventilator associated complication [iVAC]) and ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT). The ETT can also impair sinus drainage leading to an increased risk of sinusitis. The management of ETT-associated infections is similar to that described for VAP.

The point at which patients can eat following extubation should be individualized and depends upon factors including duration of intubation, mental status, and underlying comorbidities (eg, neuromuscular disorders, critical care myopathy, poor level of consciousness) which may predispose patients to dysphagia and aspiration. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Swallowing and speech impairment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional uncommon complications include tracheomalacia and tracheoarterial and tracheoesophageal fistula formation.
