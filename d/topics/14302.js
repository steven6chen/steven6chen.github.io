Primary breast abscesses develop when mastitis or cellulitis does not respond to antibiotic treatment. It is an uncommon problem in breastfeeding with a reported incidence of 0.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; the incidence among women with antibiotic-treated mastitis is 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Issues related to primary breast abscess will be reviewed here. Issues related to mastitis, cellulitis, and postoperative complications of breast surgery are discussed separately.

In a review of 89 patients with primary breast abscesses requiring surgical intervention, 14 percent were complications of lactational mastitis and 86 percent were complications of nonlactational mastitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidence of breast abscesses ranges from 0.4 to 11 percent of lactating mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Breast abscesses in nonlactating women occurred more commonly in African Americans, obese patients, and smokers.</p><p>Risk factors for development of breast abscess as a complication of lactational mastitis include maternal age &gt;30 years, first pregnancy, gestational age &ge;41 weeks, and tobacco use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]. Risk factors for a staphylococcal abscess in lactating mothers in one study identified problems with breastfeeding (odds ratio 5.0) and being a mother employed outside her home (odds ratio 2.74) as risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A breast abscess or infection associated with prior lactation is not a contraindication to subsequent breastfeeding. A prior history of mastitis in previous pregnancies, a blocked duct, cracked nipples, use of creams on nipples (particularly antifungal creams), and using a breast pump all have been reported to significantly increase the likelihood of mastitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective study of 68 patients with breast abscess, smoking was a significant risk factor for the development of an abscess (odds ratio 8.0, 95% CI 3.4-19.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of the 68 cases, over half (54 percent) needed multiple surgical treatments and 22 of these were heavy smokers. Five patients developed fistulas and all were heavy smokers. In another retrospective study of 89 patients with a breast abscess, 39 women (43 percent) were heavy smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The majority of patients who developed recurrent abscesses were smokers (77 percent). Smoking was the only factor significantly associated with abscess recurrence.</p><p>Nonlactational abscesses may be classified as central, peripheral, or skin associated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68275\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68275 \">figure 1</a>). Central abscesses are usually due to periductal mastitis. Peripheral abscesses are less common than central abscesses and are sometimes associated with underlying disease states such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, steroid treatment, and trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonlactational-mastitis-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonlactational mastitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Periductal mastitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with primary breast abscess present with localized, painful inflammation of the breast associated with fever and malaise, along with a fluctuant, tender, palpable mass. The time course is variable; mastitis and abscess may present concurrently or abscess may develop 5 to 28 days following treatment for mastitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12485103\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is based on clinical manifestations and ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Ultrasound imaging facilitates distinguishing between abscess and mastitis and also may be used for guided aspiration of the collection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62711\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62711 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Culture of the breast milk is useful to guide selection of antibiotics; it is particularly important in the setting of infection that is severe, hospital acquired, or unresponsive to initial antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Blood cultures are warranted in the setting of severe infection (eg, hemodynamic instability, progressive erythema) but are otherwise not routinely necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plugged duct <strong>&ndash;</strong> A plugged duct is a localized area of milk stasis within the milk duct that causes distention of mammary tissue. Symptoms include a palpable lump with tenderness. A plugged duct may be distinguished from mastitis and breast abscess by the absence of systemic findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common problems of breastfeeding and weaning&quot;, section on 'Plugged ducts'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Galactocele &ndash; A galactocele (also known as a milk retention cyst) is a cystic collection of fluid that is usually caused by an obstructed milk duct. Galactoceles present as soft cystic masses; they are not tender and are not associated with systemic manifestations. Ultrasonography may demonstrate a simple milk cyst or a complex mass. The diagnosis can be made on the basis of the clinical history and needle aspiration, which yields a milky substance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning#H202323719\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common problems of breastfeeding and weaning&quot;, section on 'Galactoceles'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory breast cancer &ndash; Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) should be considered if a breast infection does not resolve with appropriate treatment. Clinical manifestations include skin thickening due to edema, erythema, and peau d'orange appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65383\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65383 \">picture 1</a>). It is often associated with axillary lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is established via biopsy.

Methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) is becoming an increasingly important pathogen in cases of lactational and nonlactational mastitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Risk factors for <em>S. aureus</em> are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53504 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Less frequent pathogens include <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Bacteroides </em>species, <em>Corynebacterium</em> species, coagulase-negative staphylococci (eg, <em>Staphylococcus lugdunensis</em>), <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, and anaerobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Patients with recurrent breast abscess have an increased incidence of mixed flora and anaerobic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of primary breast abscess consists of drainage and antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/3,11,12,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,12,17-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14018021\"><span class=\"h2\">Drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Options for breast drainage include needle aspiration and surgical drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Management of breast abscess is based on the state of the overlying skin.</p><p>Needle aspiration is an appropriate initial approach for abscess drainage when the overlying skin is intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. The use of ultrasound guidance ensures complete drainage and facilitates aspiration of loculated areas as well as collections that may not be appreciated on physical exam. Needle aspiration should be repeated every two or three days until no collection remains. Two to three aspirations is sufficient in many cases, although larger collections may require up to six aspirations.</p><p>Surgical drainage is warranted in the setting of compromise of the overlying skin and in cases in which the abscess is not responsive to needle aspiration and antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In a randomized trial of 45 patients with lactational abscess, 40 percent of the patients treated with needle aspiration required subsequent incision and drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In the patients randomized to incision and drainage, 70 percent were unhappy with the cosmetic appearance. In another study of 50 patient with abscesses (including 31 who were lactating), aspiration alone was successful in 39 (78 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Risk factors for failure of needle aspiration included abscess &gt;5 cm in diameter, unusually large volume of aspirated pus, and delay in treatment.</p><p>Our approach to drainage is based on clinical experience. Some details presented here reflect the author's preferences and are not always required for successful outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Needle aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspiration of the abscess under ultrasound guidance using local anesthesia is the preferred method of management if the overlying skin is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/11-13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13,19</a>]. If the overlying skin is compromised, surgical drainage will be required. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Surgical drainage'</a> below.)</p><p>Infiltration and irrigation with local anesthetic reduces pain and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> reduces subsequent bruising. Local anesthetic is infiltrated through a small area of normal skin some distance away from the abscess. One percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with 1:200,000 epinephrine at a maximum dose of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is injected into the skin and through the breast tissue to the edge of the abscess cavity using a 21 gauge needle. If the visible pus is not particularly thick, it can be aspirated with the same needle. Aspirated material should be sent for culture. Once the pus is aspirated, the syringe is changed and the abscess cavity is lavaged with the same local anesthetic. Irrigation with local anesthetic to dilute the pus is continued until all the pus is aspirated and the aspirate from the cavity comes back clear.</p><p>If the pus is thick, local anesthetic is injected gently into the abscess cavity and aspiration is attempted. If the pus cannot be aspirated, remove the syringe and needle. After waiting for the local anesthetic and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> to take effect (at least seven or eight minutes), a 19 or 17 gauge needle is advanced along the anesthetized track into the cavity to wash the abscess with local anesthetic and dilute out the pus. Up to 50 mL of local anesthetic can be used safely in an adult, and larger volumes are safe providing that the local anesthetic that is irrigated into the cavity is later aspirated. However, too much local anesthetic injected into the abscess cavity increases the pressure in the abscess and can be painful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The patient should be reexamined every two to three days and the cavity imaged with ultrasound and aspiration repeated in a similar manner until there is no further fluid visible in the abscess cavity or the fluid aspirated is serous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/11,12,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,19</a>].</p><p>The usual sequence is that, at the second aspiration, the pus is thinner and it subsequently turns to serous fluid. Few abscesses require more than two or three aspirations. The majority of lactating breast abscesses can be managed in this manner (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74709\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74709 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>For cases in which the abscess is unresponsive to the combination of repeated drainage and antibiotics, surgical intervention is indicated.</p><p>An option to recurrent aspiration is to place a pigtail catheter into the abscess under ultrasound guidance. In a study of 34 patients, this produced resolution in all and appears a safe option to repeated aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The catheter must remain in the breast for a few days. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical drainage is warranted in the setting of compromise of the overlying skin and for cases in which the abscess is not responsive to needle aspiration and antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Incision and drainage is appropriate if the skin overlying the abscess is very thin and shiny (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68502%7EPC%2F60139%7EPC%2F79340%7EPC%2F59342\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68502 graphicRef60139 graphicRef79340 graphicRef59342 \">picture 3A-D</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63472\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63472 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76304\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76304 \">picture 4</a>), if it appears that the abscess is about to burst through the skin, or if the overlying skin is necrotic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60139\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60139 \">picture 3B</a>).</p><p>Incision and drainage can be performed with local anesthesia in most cases. If the skin is very thin, it is infiltrated with 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with 1:200,000 <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>. Care should be taken not to inject too much local anesthetic into the abscess cavity as this increases pressure in the abscess and causes pain.</p><p>Following adequate local anesthesia, a small stab incision should be made through the thinned skin and pus drained. The abscess cavity should then be irrigated with local anesthetic and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> solution until all the pus is evacuated. Abscess material should be sent for culture. The patient should be reexamined every two or three days until the wound closes and no further pus is visible either on direct inspection or on ultrasound.</p><p>In the setting of skin necrosis overlying the abscess, the necrotic skin should be excised and the cavity irrigated with local anesthetic and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> solution to drain the pus. The abscess cavity should then inspected every two or three days and irrigated as appropriate.</p><p>Large incisions are not necessary to drain breast abscesses. An incision over an abscess does not need to be dependent.

Excision is not warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A breast abscess is a localized collection of pus in the breast tissue. Primary breast abscesses develop when mastitis does not respond to antibiotic treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most primary breast abscesses are caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. Methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) infections are increasingly common. Patients with recurrent breast abscess have an increased incidence of mixed flora and anaerobic infection. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of primary breast abscess consists of drainage and antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that initial drainage be performed by needle aspiration with ultrasound guidance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Surgical drainage is indicated for patients who present with compromise of the overlying skin and for patients who do not respond to aspiration. (See <a href=\"#H14018021\" class=\"local\">'Drainage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empiric antibiotic therapy for primary breast abscess should include activity against <em>S. aureus</em>; therapy should be tailored to results of Gram stain and cultures results when available. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of lactational infection, milk drainage (either by breastfeeding or pumping) is important for resolution of infection and relief of discomfort. Women should be encouraged to continue breastfeeding following breast infection. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Role of breastfeeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that breastfeeding continue during treatment for lactation-associated breast infections (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If there is difficulty with breastfeeding, hand expression or breast pumping can be effective for maintaining the milk supply until nursing can resume. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Role of breastfeeding'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-breast-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Dener C, Inan A.
