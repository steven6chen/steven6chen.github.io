The clinical history is <strong>critical</strong> in the diagnosis of food allergy since it is used to determine subsequent testing and interpretation of results. The history and physical examination and the various manifestations of food allergy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The general characteristics of the diagnostic tools in patients with suspected food allergy are reviewed here. The sections on skin testing and in vitro testing are applicable to immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergies, although the sections on elimination diets, food diaries, and food challenges apply to multiple types of food allergy. Diagnostic tools under development are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Future diagnostic tools for food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will not discuss general gastroenterologic tests that are used in the evaluation of non-IgE-mediated food allergy and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, such as endoscopy, colonoscopy, and gastrointestinal biopsy. These procedures and other tests are presented in reviews of the individual disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophilic-gastroenteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophilic gastroenteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF ALLERGY TESTS IN DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergy testing, in the form of skin testing or in vitro tests, must always be selected and interpreted in the context of the patient's specific clinical history because a &quot;positive&quot; test (ie, sensitization, or formation of immunoglobulin E [IgE] to a specific substance) does not always indicate clinical allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8</a>]. The details of the history are used to generate an estimate of the patient's pretest probability of having allergic disease. The sensitivity and specificity of tests for individual foods (and other allergens) have been defined in children for several of the most common foods, as discussed herein. However, these values have not been determined or validated for the majority of foods or in adults. Thus, the pretest probability is essential for effective use of available testing modalities.</p><p>The way in which the pretest probability impacts the interpretation of allergy tests is illustrated by the following clinical vignettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Consider three different two-year-old children presenting for evaluation of egg allergy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient 1 has experienced two severe allergic reactions following the isolated ingestion of scrambled egg, requiring and responding to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> on both occasions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient 2 has severe atopic dermatitis and eats egg regularly. He has never experienced an apparent acute reaction to egg. However, his mother is aware that food allergy can exacerbate this condition and has therefore requested an allergy evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient 3 has no history of allergic problems, but her parents think she misbehaves more after eating egg.</p><p/><p>The pediatrician evaluating these children performs in vitro testing to egg in all three children. In each child, a moderately positive (egg white IgE: 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L;</span> ImmunoCAP) result is obtained. However, the interpretation of the result would be different in each case.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient 1 has a very high pretest probability of egg allergy, so a moderately positive test is sufficient to validate the clinical suspicion. The patient should be referred to an allergy specialist for confirmatory skin testing, which is more specific (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glossary-of-common-biostatistical-and-epidemiological-terms#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glossary of common biostatistical and epidemiological terms&quot;, section on 'Measures of diagnostic test performance'</a>). If the in vitro test had been negative, the pediatrician would be correct to question the result and refer the child to an allergy specialist for further evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient 2 has a moderate pretest probability since up to 40 percent of children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis have underlying food allergy, and egg is a common cause of childhood food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In this patient, the positive result is suggestive of true allergy, although further evaluation is needed to demonstrate that egg allergy is contributing to skin inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient 3 has an extremely low pretest probability, and the test result is not sufficiently positive to impact the clinician's initial impression. This case also illustrates one of the disadvantages of performing testing in patients whose histories are not consistent with allergic disease, as irrelevant results may confuse the situation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H943506115\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vitro testing by a generalist is appropriate when the pretest probability of food allergy is moderate to high. However, patients with positive results should be referred to an allergy specialist for further education of the patient and family and ongoing monitoring for resolution. Referral for educational purposes may also be useful when the clinician feels that the pretest probability is low but the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> suspect food allergy and are avoiding the particular food(s). Finally, referral is indicated for additional testing and management in the patient with moderate to high pretest probability of food allergy and negative in vitro testing. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Role of allergy tests in diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">prick/puncture</span> (or epicutaneous) method of skin testing is commonly used in the evaluation of a suspected immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy. The test is still valid even if the patient is not eating the food. Allergy skin testing should only be performed by allergy specialists familiar with these tests and in settings equipped with the necessary medications, equipment, and staff to treat anaphylaxis. Intradermal skin testing should <strong>not</strong> be performed in the evaluation of food allergy, because of the risk of triggering a systemic reaction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H6476491\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Safety'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Prick/puncture skin tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin prick testing is best used to investigate the possibility of an IgE-mediated reaction to a specific food in a patient with a suggestive clinical history (ie, a high pretest probability) of allergy. It is also highly effective for excluding IgE-mediated allergy, particularly in a patient with a low pretest probability. Because of the low specificity of skin testing, it should <strong>not</strong> be used to screen patients for allergy by testing with broad panels of food allergens without regard for clinical history, since this is likely to yield false-positive results.</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Prick/puncture</span> skin tests are highly reproducible and less costly to perform than in vitro testing. Skin testing causes minimal patient discomfort and yields results within 15 minutes. This type of testing can be safely performed in patients of any age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The skin of infants may be less reactive, yielding more false-negative results, although this difference has not been formally studied. Nevertheless, positive results are commonly obtained in infants with a history consistent with food allergy. Unfortunately, very young children may also have more systemic reactions to skin testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, skin testing can be performed even in infants and young children when indicated and with appropriate precautions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Precautions and preparations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergy skin testing is considered a safe procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, systemic, potentially life-threatening, allergic reactions can occur. Thus, it is recommended that this type of testing be performed by allergy specialists trained in the treatment of anaphylaxis and in a setting where full emergency equipment and medications are available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H6476491\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Safety'</a>.)</p><p>The following factors should be considered in the decision to perform skin testing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin testing should be performed only with caution in patients who, by history, are at high risk for a systemic reaction, such as patients with moderate or severe asthma who have experienced anaphylaxis previously, particularly if their asthma is poorly controlled. The decision to skin test such a patient should be made on an individual basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'High risk for anaphylaxis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medications, such as antihistamines, can interfere with skin testing and must be stopped beforehand. Preparations for skin testing are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Medications that should be discontinued'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Widespread skin conditions may preclude accurate skin testing. These include dermographism, urticaria, and severe or widespread atopic dermatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Skin conditions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin testing is not usually performed for several weeks after an episode of anaphylaxis, because it has been observed that anaphylaxis can render the skin temporarily nonreactive. The reasons for this refractory period have not been studied, although extensive depletion of surface IgE <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> granule contents within cutaneous mast cells are possible explanations. Full restoration of skin reactivity can take two to four weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Recent anaphylaxis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To perform <span class=\"nowrap\">prick/puncture</span> skin testing, a source of food allergen is applied to the skin, together with appropriate positive (histamine) and negative (saline) controls. One of several commercially available devices (metal lancets, plastic probes, bifurcated needles) is used to prick through the allergen into the top layer of the skin.</p><p>The food is pricked into the skin to introduce the allergen to cutaneous mast cells. If food-specific IgE antibody is present on the surface of the patient's mast cells, then the cells degranulate, releasing histamine and other mediators that cause localized cutaneous swelling (ie, a wheal). Vasodilation also develops as a result of an axonal reflex (ie, a flare).</p><p>A skin prick test eliciting a wheal at least 3 millimeters in diameter, after the saline control is subtracted, is considered positive. Anything else is considered negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. General issues regarding the technique of skin prick testing (for foods as well as other allergens) are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sources of food allergen include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Commercially prepared food extracts (1:10 or 1:20 <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/volume</span> in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fresh foods (wet foods can be applied directly; dry foods can be made into pastes or slurries)</p><p/><p>When fresh foods are used, the lancet can also be used to prick the food and then prick the patient's cleaned skin (&quot;prick-by-prick&quot; method). This is commonly used for testing of fresh fruits as the proteins in fruits are prone to degradation during commercial processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome#H26941118\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;, section on 'Prick-by-prick skin testing with fresh foods'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Accuracy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin prick testing is highly sensitive but only moderately specific (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glossary-of-common-biostatistical-and-epidemiological-terms#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glossary of common biostatistical and epidemiological terms&quot;, section on 'Measures of diagnostic test performance'</a>). The general sensitivity and specificity of skin prick testing for the diagnosis of food allergy are often estimated to be greater than 90 and approximately 50 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, this figure incorporates important variables, including the quality of the extract used and the degree of positivity.</p><p>The quality of commercially available skin testing food reagents is generally good, but there is some variability. Extracts of milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, fish, and shellfish are usually reliable. In contrast, commercial extracts of fruits and vegetables are sometimes inadequate because the responsible allergen may be labile and altered during processing.</p><p>Prick-by-prick testing with fresh foods, although less convenient, has a higher correlation to clinical reactivity than testing with commercial extracts for many foods. In a study of children with food allergies, for example, concordance between skin testing and challenge was 59 percent for commercial extracts and 92 percent for fresh food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The larger the wheal, the greater the likelihood of clinical allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, the size of the skin test does not correlate with the severity of a reaction. Large positive skin tests in children tested to cow's milk, egg, and peanut were shown in one study to have excellent positive predictive values for subsequent positive food challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In this study, which tested 467 children with a median age of three years using commercial extracts, a peanut skin prick test &gt;8 mm was &quot;100 percent&quot; diagnostic for a positive food challenge to peanut (the corresponding reaction for children less than two years of age was &gt;4 mm). These findings were confirmed in a subsequent study of children up to 16 years old with peanut sensitivity, in which a different manufacturer's extracts were used, suggesting the findings may be generalizable to children suspected of having peanut allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Similar cutoff values have not yet been validated for the other common food allergens or in adults. In addition, these results may not be generalizable to all populations. Additional studies are needed.</p><p>In contrast, the negative predictive accuracy for skin prick testing to foods is uniformly high. A negative skin test confirms the absence of an IgE-mediated reaction with 90 to 95 percent accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Therefore, skin testing is highly useful for excluding IgE-mediated food allergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Intradermal skin tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intradermal skin testing should <strong>not</strong> be performed in the evaluation of food allergy, since it does not add to the diagnosis and carries a greater risk of inducing a systemic reaction than does prick skin testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Fatalities have been reported with intradermal testing to foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/13,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H22408539\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Intradermal testing and high-risk allergens'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Atopy patch tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atopy patch testing is another type of skin testing that involves the topical application of a food-containing solution to the skin for 48 hours and has shown some promise in the diagnosis of <strong>non-IgE</strong>-mediated food allergy. However, there are no standardized reagents, application methods, or guidelines for interpretation, and this type of testing cannot be recommended outside of research settings. This method is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Future diagnostic tools for food allergy&quot;, section on 'Atopy patch testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">IN VITRO TESTING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunoassays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radioallergosorbent tests (RASTs) and fluorescent enzyme immunoassay (FEIA) tests are in vitro assays used to identify food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the serum. The commercially available tests in use do not employ radioactivity, although the term &quot;RAST&quot; is often used erroneously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-in-vitro-allergy-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of in vitro allergy tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Immunoassays are considered less sensitive than skin prick tests, although the two modalities may be equivalent for certain foods (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glossary-of-common-biostatistical-and-epidemiological-terms#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glossary of common biostatistical and epidemiological terms&quot;, section on 'Measures of diagnostic test performance'</a>). The test is still valid even if the patient is not eating the food. Immunoassays are also significantly more costly than skin testing, and the results are not as immediately available. However, immunoassays for food-specific IgE have several useful features. In vitro tests are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Widely available</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unaffected by the presence of antihistamines or other medications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Useful in patients with severe anaphylaxis in whom skin testing may carry an unacceptable degree of risk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Useful in patients with dermatologic conditions that may preclude skin testing, such as severe atopic dermatitis and dermographism</p><p/><p>The test results are reported as food-specific IgE levels (in <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L)</span>. Although higher concentrations of food-specific IgE correlate to an increased likelihood of a reaction upon ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>], an individual patient with a significant food allergy can have a high, medium, low, or even negative in vitro test using these systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It is also true that a patient can have a low positive FEIA test for a food to which they are tolerant. Thus, the patient's clinical history is critical to both determining the tests to perform and confirming the diagnosis. The results of immunoassays are also reported using percentage, class, or numerical ranks that compare the amount of IgE present in the patient's serum to a standard curve. These values are largely ignored by allergy specialists due to the great variability in the positive predictive value cutoffs for different foods that are also influenced by the age of the patient.</p><p>Several large studies have used the Phadia ImmunoCAP fluorescent enzyme immunoassay (CAP-FEIA) system, and so normative results from studies on selected patient groups are available for this specific product. Values obtained with other testing systems are not necessarily interchangeable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Very high positive predictive accuracy <strong>in children</strong> can be achieved using the Phadia ImmunoCAP system. In a retrospective study of nearly 200 pediatric patients with food allergy, minimum levels of IgE to specific foods were identified that were associated with a 95 percent positive predictive value for clinical food hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Approximately 90 percent of these children had atopic dermatitis.</p><p>The validity of these values in a less selected population was then prospectively evaluated in a study in which the sera of 100 children and adolescents (mean age of 3.8 years, range 0.4 to 14 years) with possible food allergy was assessed for reactivity to egg, milk, peanuts, and fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The concentrations of specific IgE antibodies were compared with the clinical history and the results obtained by skin testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Based upon the same minimum values obtained in the previous study, positive predictive values of 96, 100, 100, and 100 percent were obtained with the Phadia CAP-FEIA system for clinical allergies to egg, milk, peanut, and fish, respectively.</p><p>Subsequent studies have generated somewhat different predictive values, possibly because of variations in the patient populations or testing protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/26,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29,30</a>]. In addition, the predictive values vary with age, such that younger children and infants display symptoms at lower serum levels of food-specific IgE compared with older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Based primarily upon studies performed in the United States in children with a history of food allergy and eczema older than two years of age, the 95 percent predictive levels for egg, milk, peanut, tree nuts, and fish are as follow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Egg, 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> for children less than two years of age)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Milk, 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> for children less than two years of age)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peanut, 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tree nuts, approximately 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fish, 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span></p><p/><p>Thus, a <strong>child</strong> over two years old with a convincing history of egg allergy has a greater than 95 percent likelihood of experiencing an allergic reaction to egg upon challenge if <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> egg-specific IgE <strong>exceeds</strong> 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span>. Therefore, challenge is unnecessary in such children. Equivalent predictive positive levels for soy and wheat have <strong>not</strong> yet been established. To reiterate, these data were developed in children, and there are no recommendations regarding their interpretation in adults with food allergy.</p><p>Some children with egg allergy may tolerate egg in baked goods but react on ingestion of lightly cooked egg. Similar findings are seen with milk allergy. In one series, the 95 percent positive predictive values for reacting to raw egg white on challenge were 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> for egg white and 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> for ovomucoid using the Phadia ImmunoCAP system. The corresponding levels for patients reacting to heated egg white on challenge were 62 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

This was found in a retrospective study of over 600 food challenges in nearly 400 children, in whom all had food-specific IgE levels measured by CAP-RAST. For milk and egg, approximately 50 percent of children with CAP-RAST values of approximately 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> tolerated these foods on challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6106817\"><span class=\"h2\">Component testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foods are comprised of numerous proteins, and an individual with a food allergy may have immune responses of varying degrees to any of them. The potency of individual proteins in a food may relate to their lability. Proteins that are destroyed easily by heating or digestion are less likely to cause significant allergic reactions compared with heat or digestion-stable proteins. Ara h 2, for example, is a peanut seed storage protein that is stable. IgE responses to this protein are associated with severe reactions compared with IgE responses to the peanut protein Ara h 8, which is a labile protein homologous to a protein in birch tree pollen. An individual with a strong immune response to Ara h 2 and no response to Ara h 8 might be predicted to have a severe peanut allergy compared with a person with no response to Ara h 2 and a modest response to Ara h 8, even though a positive test to whole peanut extract would be positive in both, possibly with the same result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This testing is discussed in more detail separately.

This method provides no additional information beyond standard in vitro and skin testing methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Basophil activation testing (BAT), a different type of basophil test, is discussed separately.

Elimination diets may be of some help in diagnostic work-up but seldom. This topic reviews diagnostic elimination diets.</p><p>There are at least three different types of elimination diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One type of elimination diet removes one or several suspect foods from a patient's diet to determine if they are causing or exacerbating a condition. If improvement is noted, then allergy is possible and further objective testing to implicate that food should be pursued. If no improvement is noted with the appropriate period of avoidance, then allergy to that food is unlikely. Trial elimination diets should be limited in duration. A period of two weeks is usually sufficient to see a response in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated disorders. Resolution of disorders with non-IgE mechanisms may take weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Nutrition must be evaluated in children if such prolonged elimination is prescribed for an important food(s). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Nutritional issues&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second type of elimination diet that is used rarely involves prescribing an &quot;oligoantigenic&quot; diet in which a nutritionally complete selection of foods is allowed and other foods that are commonly implicated in allergic disorders are removed temporarily from the diet. An example of an oligoantigenic diet is one in which the following foods were allowed: rice, lamb, cooked apple, sweet potato, asparagus, spinach, lettuce, olive oil, salt, and sugar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This approach may be useful in the evaluation of patients with chronic conditions, such as atopic dermatitis or chronic urticaria, in which food allergy is questioned, but no specific food can be implicated. Again, it is advisable to involve a nutritionist when eliminating multiple foods from the diet of a growing child. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Nutritional issues&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third type of elimination diet involves the use of elemental diets, which are usually achieved through the use of extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based formulas. These are used by some allergy specialists in the evaluation of disorders associated with multiple food sensitivities, such as eosinophilic esophagitis. Such diets can have adverse consequences and should only be prescribed with great caution, particularly in infants and children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis#H9242276\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary management of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;, section on 'Elemental diets'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elimination diets are also employed prior to food challenges, to ensure that the food is cleared from the patient's system and is not interfering with the ability to appreciate a reaction. As an example, if a challenge is performed to determine if a food is worsening atopic dermatitis and the patient continues to eat the food up until the challenge, then the skin may already be sufficiently inflamed at baseline that no change is appreciated during the challenge. As a note of caution, a patient may react more dramatically to a food if the food has been eliminated from the diet for some time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies&quot;, section on 'Elimination diets'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;, section on 'Food allergies'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The utility of diagnostic elimination diets is influenced by patient- and clinician-related variables. Successful elimination of foods requires an understanding of how to approach avoidance of allergens, which necessitates knowledge of label reading, cross contact, and other details. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The interpretation of an elimination diet also requires some skill on the part of the clinician. As an example, although dairy avoidance may reduce symptoms, this could be secondary to various types of cow's milk hypersensitivity or to lactose intolerance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">FOOD DIARIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food diaries are written records of everything that is ingested by a patient, including all foodstuffs, beverages, condiments, and candies. Although rarely diagnostic on their own, food diaries occasionally may be helpful in identifying a food that was overlooked by the patient, a food containing hidden ingredients, or patterns of reactions (eg, in association with exercise, alcohol, or anti-inflammatory medications).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">FOOD CHALLENGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral food challenges are structured protocols in which the patient ingests a suspect food under clinician supervision. Food challenges should only be performed by allergy specialists familiar with food-allergic reactions and in settings equipped with the necessary medications, equipment, and staff to treat anaphylaxis. Food challenges are covered in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">UNVALIDATED METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may present after having food allergy tests performed that have not been validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/3,5,22,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,22,38</a>]. These can include food-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG4 tests, which typically yield multiple positive results and may represent a normal immune response to food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Food-specific IgG4 does not predict true food hypersensitivity and may actually be a marker of earlier development of tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/38,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40-42</a>]. In one study, children with atopic dermatitis (eczema) and egg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> milk allergy who had higher levels of IgG4 to milk and egg proteins on presentation were more likely to be tolerant to these foods by 4.5 years of age compared with children with lower IgG4 levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In another study, resolution of cow's milk allergy was associated with increasing IgG4 and decreasing immunoglobulin E (IgE) binding to milk protein epitopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This was further confirmed in children with egg allergy who were challenged to egg in baked goods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The children who failed the challenge had higher ovalbumin and ovomucoid <span class=\"nowrap\">IgE/IgG4</span> ratios compared with the children who passed the challenge. In addition, IgG4 increased in patients who successfully underwent oral immunotherapy for milk or peanut allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Thus, food-specific IgG4 should not be used as a tool to diagnose food allergy, and food should not be eliminated from the diet based upon results of these tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Other types of testing for food allergy that are not supported by scientifically valid concepts include sublingual or intradermal provocation tests, tests of lymphocyte activation, kinesiology, cytotoxic tests, and electrodermal testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4059875675\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

It is also used to determine the type of testing that is most appropriate and to interpret test results. This essential component of food allergy diagnosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H4048840\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin testing for food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) is used only in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergies. Skin testing is more sensitive than in vitro testing in many cases. It should be performed by an allergy specialist because of both the risk of anaphylaxis and the skill required for proper interpretation. Skin testing is contraindicated or unreliable in certain subsets of patients. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Skin testing'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive skin test to a particular food only indicates the <strong>possibility</strong> that the patient has true allergy to that food. The specificity of skin testing for foods varies from 50 to 95 percent, depending upon the food in question and the patient's pretest probability of having allergy. Further tests or challenges are usually needed to confirm that the patient is truly reactive to the food upon ingestion. In contrast, a negative skin test result indicates the absence of an IgE-mediated allergy upon subsequent challenge with a 90 to 95 percent predictive accuracy. Further testing or challenge is sometimes indicated. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Role of allergy tests in diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Skin testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgE immunoassays are in vitro assays used to identify food-specific IgE in the serum. These tests are widely available and are unaffected by the presence of medications. Their sensitivity varies among different foods. In at least one system, immunoassays have demonstrated very high positive predictive accuracy <strong>in children</strong> for several of the major food allergens. Values have been established for egg, milk, peanut, tree nuts, and fish that correspond to a positive predictive accuracy of 95 percent for a reaction on challenge, such that a child with a test result higher than these values, in combination with a suspicion of an allergy to the food, does not require challenge for definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'In vitro testing'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-in-vitro-allergy-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of in vitro allergy tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic elimination diets are employed in various ways depending on the clinical scenario.
