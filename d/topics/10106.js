It helps with muscle strength, sex drive, and bone strength.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30064715\"><span class=\"h1\">What is low testosterone in men?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low testosterone is when the body makes too little testosterone. The medical term for this is &quot;androgen deficiency,&quot; but many people call it just &quot;low T.&quot; As men get older, it is normal for levels of testosterone to get a bit lower. But when the levels of testosterone get <strong>too</strong> low, men can have symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30064730\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of low T?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms are different depending on how long a man has had low T.</p><p>At first, men with low T:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel tired, especially at the end of the day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have little or no interest in sex (also called &quot;low libido&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel sad, down, or depressed</p><p/><p>After a year or more of having low T, men develop other symptoms or medical problems, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of muscle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of bone strength</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of facial or body hair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growing breasts (also called &quot;gynecomastia&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30064745\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes low T in men?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low T in men can be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal aging</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury or infection affecting the testicles (which make most of the testosterone in men)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain treatments for cancer, including radiation, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy for prostate cancer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders that affect the pituitary gland, a gland at the base of the brain that controls all hormone-producing organs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medical problems, such as liver and kidney disease, obesity, diabetes, and AIDS</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other rare genetic problems</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30064760\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, if you have symptoms of low T, see your doctor or nurse. There are many things that can cause those symptoms. Your doctor or nurse can try to find out what might be causing them. A blood test can show whether you have low T, but you might not need that test if something else is causing your symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30064775\"><span class=\"h1\">How is low testosterone in men treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low testosterone can be treated with testosterone replacement, which comes in shots, patches, gels, and tablets you put on your gums (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86166 \">table 1</a>). But low testosterone is not always treated, especially in men older than 60. That's because it&rsquo;s normal for testosterone to drop a bit in all men as they age. In fact, normal aging causes some of the same changes that happen in men with low testosterone, such as less energy or interest in sex.</p><p>Experts are worried that testosterone treatments might increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes in some men. This has not been proven, but doctors are careful about when to suggest testosterone, especially in older men.</p><p>Men older than 60 might have testosterone replacement if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least 2 or 3 blood tests show very low testosterone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have symptoms of low testosterone that bother them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms are not caused by another disease or condition that doctors can treat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have not had a heart attack or stroke</p><p/><p>Older men who have testosterone replacement need regular screening tests for prostate cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30064807\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=androgen-replacement-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Androgen replacement in men (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormones-to-boost-sports-performance-risks-and-side-effects-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hormones to boost sports performance: Risks and side effects (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in men (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-men-develop-breasts-gynecomastia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When men develop breasts (gynecomastia) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gynecomastia-breast-enlargement-in-men-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gynecomastia (breast enlargement in men) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-men-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in men (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
