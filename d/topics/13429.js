At the same time, surgery and invasive procedures have associated bleeding risks that are increased by the anticoagulant(s) administered for thromboembolism prevention. If the patient bleeds from the procedure, their anticoagulant may need to be discontinued for a longer period, resulting in a longer period of increased thromboembolic risk. A balance between reducing the risk of thromboembolism and preventing excessive bleeding must be reached for each patient.</p><p>Additional issues relate to the specific anticoagulant used. For those taking a vitamin K antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>), it takes several days until the anticoagulant effect is reduced and then reestablished perioperatively; the risks and benefits of &quot;bridging&quot; with a shorter acting agent, such as heparin, during this time are unclear. The newer direct oral anticoagulants (eg, direct thrombin inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>, factor Xa inhibitors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edoxaban</a>) have shorter half-lives, making them easier to discontinue and resume rapidly, but the direct factor Xa inhibitors lack an approved drug-specific antidote, which raises concerns about treatment of bleeding and management of patients who require an urgent surgery or invasive procedure.</p><p>Our approach to managing ongoing anticoagulation in patients undergoing surgery or an invasive procedure is discussed here.

Our approach to perioperative management of anticoagulation takes into account these risks, along with specific features of the anticoagulant the patient is taking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Of note, much of our approach is based on expert opinion; thrombotic and bleeding risks may vary depending on individual circumstances, and data from randomized trials or well-designed observational studies are not available to guide practice in many settings. In addition, the best surrogate for complete resolution of anticoagulant effect is not always known or available for the newer direct oral anticoagulants. Thus, this approach should be used as clinical guidance and should not substitute for clinician judgment in decisions about perioperative anticoagulant management for individual patients.</p><p>Our approach to decision making is outlined as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Estimate thromboembolic risk</strong> &ndash; A higher thromboembolic risk increases the importance of minimizing the interval without anticoagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86930\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86930 \">table 1</a>). We estimate thromboembolic risk for patients with atrial fibrillation based on age and comorbidities. For those with a recent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, we estimate the risk based on the interval since diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If thromboembolic risk is transiently increased (eg, recent stroke, recent pulmonary embolism), we prefer to delay surgery until the risk returns to baseline, if possible. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Estimating thromboembolic risk'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with more than one condition that predisposes to thromboembolism, the condition with the highest thromboembolic risk takes precedence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Estimate bleeding risk</strong> &ndash; A higher bleeding risk confers a greater need for perioperative hemostasis, and hence a longer period of anticoagulant interruption. Bleeding risk is dominated by the type and urgency of surgery; some patient comorbidities also contribute. Procedures with a low bleeding risk (eg, dental extractions, minor skin surgery) often can be performed without interruption of anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Estimating procedural bleeding risk'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Deciding whether to interrupt anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Determine the timing of anticoagulant interruption</strong> &ndash; The timing of anticoagulant interruption depends on the specific agent the patient is receiving. As examples, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> requires earlier discontinuation than the shorter-acting direct oral anticoagulants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edoxaban</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F93260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93260 \">table 2</a>).

However, some patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> with an especially high thromboembolic risk (eg, mechanical heart valve, recent stroke) may benefit from bridging with heparin or low molecular weight (LMW) heparin.

We take into account these risks, along with specific features of the anticoagulant the patient is taking. Case examples are provided above. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview of our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thromboembolic risk</strong> &ndash; Those at very high or high thromboembolic risk should limit the period without anticoagulation to the shortest possible interval. The major factors that increase thromboembolic risk are atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart valves, and recent venous or arterial thromboembolism (eg, within the preceding three months) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86930\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86930 \">table 1</a>). If thromboembolic risk is transiently increased (eg, recent stroke, recent pulmonary embolism), we prefer to delay surgery until the risk returns to baseline, if possible. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Estimating thromboembolic risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Atrial fibrillation</strong> &ndash; In the RE-LY trial, the perioperative thromboembolic risk was 1.2 percent based on a composite endpoint of stroke, cardiovascular death, and pulmonary embolus. We estimate thromboembolic risk for patients with atrial fibrillation based on clinical variables including age and comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H4194955\" class=\"local\">'Atrial fibrillation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Prosthetic heart valve</strong> &ndash; The risks of thromboembolism and perioperative management of patients with bioprosthetic and mechanical heart valves are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-management-of-bleeding-and-invasive-procedures#H742473845\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy for prosthetic heart valves: Management of bleeding and invasive procedures&quot;, section on 'Management of antithrombotic therapy for invasive procedures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-mechanical-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-or-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Recent thromboembolism</strong> &ndash; The perioperative risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is greatest in individuals with an event within the prior three months, and those with a history of VTE associated with a high-risk inherited thrombophilia. Patients who require surgery within the first three months following an episode of VTE are likely to benefit from delaying elective surgery, even if the delay is only for a few weeks. The risk of recurrent arterial embolism from any cardiac source is approximately 0.5 percent per day in the first month after an acute event. (See <a href=\"#H4194961\" class=\"local\">'Recent thromboembolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bleeding risk</strong> &ndash; A higher bleeding risk confers a greater need for perioperative hemostasis, and hence a longer period of anticoagulant interruption. Bleeding risk is dominated by the type and urgency of surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86929\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86929 \">table 3</a>); some patient comorbidities (eg, older age, decreased renal function) and medications that affect hemostasis also contribute. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Estimating procedural bleeding risk'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Deciding whether to interrupt anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>High risk</strong> &ndash; High bleeding risk procedures include coronary artery bypass surgery, kidney biopsy, and any procedure lasting &gt;45 minutes. In general, the anticoagulant must be discontinued if the surgical bleeding risk is high. (See <a href=\"#H752806\" class=\"local\">'Settings requiring anticoagulant interruption'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Low risk</strong> &ndash; Low bleeding risk procedures include dental extractions, minor skin surgery, cholecystectomy, carpal tunnel repair, and abdominal hysterectomy. Individuals undergoing selected low bleeding risk surgery often can continue their anticoagulant. (See <a href=\"#H752869\" class=\"local\">'Settings in which continuing the anticoagulant may be preferable'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Cardiac implantable device or catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation</strong> &ndash; Continuing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> was associated with a <strong>lower </strong>risk of bleeding in patients on the BRUISE CONTROL trial who were undergoing implantation of a cardiac implantable electronic device (eg, pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) and patients on the COMPARE trial who were undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. (See <a href=\"#H6446132\" class=\"local\">'Overview of whether to interrupt'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac implantable electronic devices: Peri-procedural complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Timing of interruption</strong> &ndash; If a decision has been made to interrupt the anticoagulant, the timing of discontinuation and reinitiation depends on the specific agent used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F93260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93260 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H752909\" class=\"local\">'Timing of anticoagulant interruption'</a> above and <a href=\"#H753184\" class=\"local\">'Warfarin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H753191\" class=\"local\">'Dabigatran'</a> above and <a href=\"#H753198\" class=\"local\">'Rivaroxaban'</a> above and <a href=\"#H753205\" class=\"local\">'Apixaban'</a> above and <a href=\"#H86520245\" class=\"local\">'Edoxaban'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bridging</strong> &ndash; Bridging anticoagulation involves the administration of a short-acting anticoagulant, typically a low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, during the interruption of a longer-acting agent, typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. The intent is to minimize the risk of perioperative thromboembolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For selected patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (eg, mechanical mitral valve; stroke, systemic embolism, or transient ischemic attack within the previous 12 weeks; mechanical aortic valve and additional stroke risk factors; atrial fibrillation and very high risk of stroke [eg, CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 5 or 6]; venous thromboembolism within the previous 12 weeks; recent coronary stenting; previous thromboembolism during interruption of chronic anticoagulation), we suggest the use of bridging (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For most other patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> with atrial fibrillation or VTE, we suggest not using bridging (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We feel more strongly about avoiding bridging the lower the baseline thromboembolic risk and the higher the bleeding risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast to individuals on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, bridging usually is not required for individuals receiving a direct thrombin inhibitor or factor Xa inhibitor, because these agents have shorter half-lives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F93260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93260 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2123978\" class=\"local\">'Appropriate settings for bridging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Agent</strong> &ndash; When bridging is used, we prefer LMW heparin for most patients. An exception is an individual with renal insufficiency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemodialysis requirement, for whom intravenous or subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> can be used more easily.

Non-heparin anticoagulants that can be used in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H752923\" class=\"local\">'Heparin product and dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Timing</strong> &ndash; Bridging can be used preoperatively, postoperatively, or both, depending on the underlying condition for which the patient is being anticoagulated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81389\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81389 \">table 9</a>). The timing depends on the heparin product used and the procedural bleeding risk. Importantly, resumption of bridging anticoagulation too early is associated with an increased risk for major bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H7923007\" class=\"local\">'When to bridge: Preoperative, postoperative, or both'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4198717\" class=\"local\">'Timing of bridging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Heart valve</strong> &ndash; Perioperative anticoagulation in individuals with prosthetic heart valves is presented separately.
