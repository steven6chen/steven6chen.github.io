Each of these bones has a hole in the center. When stacked, the bones form a hollow tube (called the spinal canal) that protects the spinal cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal cord and nerves &ndash; The spinal cord is the highway of nerves that connects the brain to the rest of the body. It runs through the vertebrae. Nerves branch from the spinal cord and pass in between the vertebrae. From there they connect to the arms, the legs, and the organs. (This is why problems in the back can cause leg pain or bladder problems.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discs &ndash; Rubbery discs sit in between each of the vertebrae to add cushion and allow movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscles, tendons, and ligaments &ndash; Together the muscles, tendons, and ligaments are called the &quot;soft tissues&quot; of the back. These soft tissues support the back and help hold the different parts together.</p><p/><p>Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal or of the spaces between the vertebrae where spinal nerves pass through. This narrowing is usually caused by arthritis or injury, and can cause symptoms for different reasons.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vertebrae can form &quot;bone spurs.&quot; These are bony growths that pinch the spinal cord or the nerves branching from the spinal cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The discs can shrink and make the space between the vertebrae smaller. This can cause the vertebrae to pinch the nerves that pass through them.</p><p/><p>This article will only discuss spinal stenosis in the lower back. This is called &quot;lumbar spinal stenosis.&quot; Other parts of the back can have spinal stenosis, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27462494\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a spinal stenosis in the lower back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal stenosis does not always cause symptoms. When it does, the most common symptoms are back pain and tingling or numbness that spreads down the legs. These symptoms usually affect both legs, but the symptoms can be worse in one leg than the other. Severe spinal stenosis can cause leg weakness or trouble controlling your bowels or bladder.</p><p>Symptoms of spinal stenosis are usually worse when the person is walking or standing upright. Usually, the symptoms get better if the person sits down or bends forward at the waist, for example, while leaning over a shopping cart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27462509\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for spinal stenosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Tests, such as an MRI or a CT scan, can show what's going on inside the back. These tests can show if a person has bone spurs or other changes that happen with spinal stenosis.</p><p>In some cases, doctors also order tests called &quot;electromyography&quot; or &quot;nerve conduction studies.&quot; These tests measure how well electrical signals travel across the nerves that start in the spine. They can also show how well electrical signals travel from the spine to muscles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27462524\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back or leg pain that is so severe that you cannot find a comfortable position</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back or leg pain, plus a new problem controlling your bowels or bladder</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back or leg pain, plus new numbness or weakness in the legs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A problem called &quot;foot drop,&quot; which is when you have trouble holding your foot up, for example, while walking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back or leg pain along with a fever or other symptoms that worry you</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27462539\"><span class=\"h1\">How is spinal stenosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small number of people end up needing surgery to treat a spinal stenosis. But most people do well with simpler treatments, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain medicines that you can get without a prescription &ndash; If these do not work, doctors and nurses can prescribe stronger pain medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to relax the muscles (called muscle relaxants)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injections of medicines that numb the back</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy to teach you special exercises and stretches</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal manipulation, which is when someone like a physical therapist or a chiropractor moves or &quot;adjusts&quot; the joints of your back</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acupuncture, which is when someone who knows traditional Chinese medicine inserts tiny needles into your body to block pain signals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massage</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27462554\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if surgery is right for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will tell you if surgery is likely to help you. The 2 of you can decide together if surgery is right for you. The surgery can help with symptoms, but it is not usually necessary. People can often find ways to cope with their symptoms that do not involve surgery.</p><p>Surgery to treat a spinal stenosis involves exposing the spine and cutting away pieces of bone that are pinching the spinal cord or other nerves. In some cases, surgeons treating people with spinal stenosis will also decide to join together 2 vertebrae. This is called spinal fusion. Fusion is usually appropriate only for people who have spinal stenosis plus another condition called &quot;spondylolisthesis,&quot; which is when 2 vertebrae no longer line up with each other. Spinal fusion can involve more risk and a longer recovery time than regular surgery.</p><p>If your doctor suggests surgery to treat a spinal stenosis, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How likely is that surgery will help my symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How quickly will I recover from surgery?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks of surgery?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens I do not have surgery?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27462569\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. One of the most important things you can do to feel better is to stay as active as possible. Even if you have some pain or discomfort, you should not stay in bed or rest too long.</p><p>People used to think that bedrest was the best treatment for a bad back. The truth is, bedrest can actually make back problems worse. That's because the back can get weak and stiff with too much rest.</p><p>Find physical activities you like to do. If you have not been active for a while, start by doing just a few minutes of activity a few times a week. Then slowly do more. Also, ask your doctor if there are any activities, such as bending or lifting, that you shouldn't do.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27462584\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cauda-equina-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cauda equina syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=do-i-need-an-x-ray-or-other-test-for-low-back-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Do I need an X-ray (or other test) for low back pain?
