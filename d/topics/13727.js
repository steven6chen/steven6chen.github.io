The diagnosis and management of this disorder are reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A viral etiology for pityriasis rosea (PR) has been hypothesized based upon the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PR is sometimes preceded by a prodrome.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It occasionally occurs in small case clusters.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It has not been shown to be associated with bacterial or fungal organisms.</p><p/><p>This supposition is reinforced by the finding of viral-like particles in PR biopsy specimens examined with the electron microscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A significant literature supports the hypothesis that PR is a manifestation of human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) reactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, others have failed to detect HHV-7 DNA sequences and antigens in a significant number of PR cases, arguing against a causative role for this agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some studies have also implicated HHV-6 in the pathogenesis of PR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. Possible associations with HHV-8 and 2009-2010 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>More study is needed before this issue can be definitively resolved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PR is largely a disease of older children and young adults. It is slightly more common in women than men. A prodrome of headache, malaise, and pharyngitis may occur in a small number of cases, but except for itching, the condition is usually asymptomatic.</p><p>In 50 to 90 percent of cases, the eruption begins with a &quot;herald&quot; or &quot;mother&quot; patch, a single round or oval, sharply delimited, pink or salmon-colored lesion on the chest, neck, or back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87126%7EDERM%2F69881\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87126 graphicRef69881 \">picture 1C, 1F</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The herald patch is usually 2 to 5 cm in diameter. The lesion soon becomes scaly and begins to clear centrally, leaving the free edge of the cigarette paper-like scale directed inwards toward the center. This clinical finding is often described as a &quot;collarette&quot; of scale.</p><p>A few days or one to two weeks later, oval lesions similar in appearance to the herald patch, but smaller, appear in crops on the trunk and proximal areas of the extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F99949%7EDERM%2F87124%7EDERM%2F98333%7EDERM%2F87126%7EDERM%2F98332%7EDERM%2F98335\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99949 graphicRef87124 graphicRef98333 graphicRef87126 graphicRef98332 graphicRef98335 \">picture 1A-E, 1G</a>). The long axes of these oval lesions tend to be oriented along the lines of cleavage of the skin. This characteristic arrangement is most evident on the back, where it is emphasized by the oblique direction of the cleavage lines in that location. This morphologic pattern has been referred to as a &quot;fir tree&quot; or &quot;Christmas tree&quot; distribution.</p><p>The eruption spreads centrifugally or from the top down over the course of a few days. Erythema gradually subsides, desquamation is completed, and the eruption fades, leaving few residual changes, except postinflammatory dyspigmentation. In most cases the papules and plaques resolve in four to six weeks; occasionally the disease will persist for several months. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is a common sequela in dark-skinned individuals and often takes several months or longer to resolve. </p><p>In children, the distribution of the lesions is often atypical, involving the scalp and face; it may be completely &quot;inverse,&quot; affecting the face and distal extremities, while sparing the trunk, or may be concentrated in the pubic, inguinal, and axillary regions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F98335%7EDERM%2F64728%7EDERM%2F98336%7EDERM%2F98334\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98335 graphicRef64728 graphicRef98336 graphicRef98334 \">picture 1G-J</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The lesions themselves also are sometimes atypical in children; they may be folliculo-papular, vesicular, pustular, urticarial, or purpuric. PR generally has only mild effects on quality of life in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Oropharyngeal abnormalities have been reported in patients with PR. In a review of 527 patients with PR, 149 patients (28 percent) had oropharyngeal lesions, with petechial, macular, and papular eruptions as the most common findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Oropharyngeal swabs for culture were performed in 90 patients and showed normal flora in all patients. Mucosal biopsies were not performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a herald patch by history or on examination, the characteristic morphology and distribution of the lesions, and the absence of symptoms other than pruritus combine to make PR an easy diagnosis in most instances. However, the herald patch can resemble tinea corporis so closely that potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination of scales for dermatophyte hyphae may be necessary to distinguish these conditions. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-dermatologic-diagnostic-procedures#H4044416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures&quot;, section on 'Potassium hydroxide preparation'</a>.)</p><p>There are typically no laboratory abnormalities with PR. Serologic testing to rule out syphilis is recommended for sexually active patients. The cutaneous manifestations of secondary syphilis resemble PR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F60313\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60313 \">picture 3B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing#H1818142166\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Screening and diagnostic testing&quot;, section on 'Approach to testing'</a>.)</p><p>Skin biopsy is rarely necessary, but when performed shows focal parakeratosis with or without acanthosis, spongiosis, a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes, and occasionally extravasation of red cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F98338\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98338 \">picture 2</a>). The biopsy picture is characteristic, but not pathognomonic. A 3 mm or 4 mm punch biopsy typically provides an adequate specimen for analysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;, section on 'Punch biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A differential diagnosis should always be considered in patients who present with lesions that are suspicious for PR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. When the diagnosis is in question, a skin biopsy can be performed. A potassium hydroxide preparation is useful for ruling out fungal infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;, section on 'Punch biopsy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-dermatologic-diagnostic-procedures#H4044416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures&quot;, section on 'Potassium hydroxide preparation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Secondary syphilis </strong>&ndash; The papulosquamous eruption of secondary syphilis can closely resemble PR; however, unlike the latter, secondary syphilis often presents with red-brown macules on the palms and soles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65500%7EDERM%2F60313\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65500 graphicRef60313 \">picture 3A-B</a>). Patients with secondary syphilis also may recall the appearance of a chancre and will lack a history of a herald patch. In patients in whom secondary syphilis is suspected, appropriate serologic testing should be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Screening and diagnostic testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Guttate psoriasis </strong>&ndash; Guttate psoriasis is a variant of psoriasis that most frequently affects children and young adults. Small, erythematous, scaly plaques are distributed primarily on the trunk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55141\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55141 \">picture 4</a>). The scale tends to be coarser than the scale associated with PR, and a herald patch does not precede the eruption. Guttate psoriasis frequently is associated with a preceding streptococcal infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guttate-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guttate psoriasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tinea corporis </strong>&ndash; The herald patch of PR may be mistaken for tinea corporis, which may also present with an annular plaque with peripheral scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66102\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66102 \">picture 5</a>). A KOH preparation from a lesion of tinea corporis will reveal fungal hyphae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatophyte-tinea-infections#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatophyte (tinea) infections&quot;, section on 'Tinea corporis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tinea versicolor </strong>&ndash; Tinea versicolor presents with hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules that are most commonly located on the neck and trunk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59533%7EPC%2F73839\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59533 graphicRef73839 \">picture 6A-B</a>). Unlike in PR, erythema is absent or minimal. The scale in tinea versicolor is fine, and lesions lack the peripheral rim of scale that is often seen in PR. A KOH preparation easily confirms a diagnosis of tinea versicolor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinea-versicolor-pityriasis-versicolor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tinea versicolor (Pityriasis versicolor)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nummular eczema </strong>&ndash; Nummular eczema presents with intensely pruritic, coin-shaped plaques that may range in size from 2 to 10 cm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58067%7EDERM%2F66792\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58067 graphicRef66792 \">picture 7A-B</a>). Involvement of the extremities is more common in nummular eczema than in PR. Serous exudate may be visible in acute lesions of nummular eczema.

Routine treatment with these interventions is <strong>not</strong> recommended because efficacy data are limited and PR typically resolves without treatment.

As an example, a study of 101 children and adults with PR found statistically significant reductions in PR severity scores on the side of the body treated with broadband UVB four times per week, but not on the side treated with a very low dose of ultraviolet A (UVA) as a control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Patients received a mean of five treatments. In addition, in a study in which broadband UVB was used to treat one-half of the body for 10 treatments over two weeks in 17 patients with extensive PR, and a very low dose of UVA was given contralaterally as a control, UVB significantly decreased disease severity during the treatment period. However, the difference in effect was no longer present two weeks after the completion of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. UVB had no effect on pruritus in this study. In contrast, a split-body study of 20 patients with PR found that broadband UVB therapy decreased the extent of disease and pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Narrowband UVB devices, which emit UVB in the range of 311 to 313 nm rather than the 290 nm to 320 nm range emitted by broadband UVB devices, are now commonly used for the treatment of skin diseases previously treated with broadband UVB. A randomized trial in which 100 patients with PR were randomly assigned to narrowband UVB phototherapy (three times weekly for four weeks) or no treatment found greater improvement in disease severity scores and itching among patients treated with narrowband UVB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Worsening of PR following narrowband UVB phototherapy has been reported in one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]; however, it is unclear whether the exacerbation of disease was secondary to phototherapy or the natural course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;UVB therapy (broadband and narrowband)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">UVA1 phototherapy also may have some benefit for the treatment of PR, although it has much more limited availability. In an uncontrolled study of patients with extensive PR, UVA1 was associated with improvements in disease severity, and 12 out of 15 patients noted improvement in pruritus (mean number of treatments = 6.5 &plusmn; 1.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uva1-phototherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;UVA1 phototherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In clinical practice, exposure to outdoor sunlight is sometimes suggested to patients with PR. However, data on the efficacy of this mode of exposure to ultraviolet light are lacking. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash; The best regimen for phototherapy is unclear. When treating PR with phototherapy, we most frequently treat with broadband or narrowband UVB two to three times per week. Improvement is expected within the first two to three weeks of treatment. Additional studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy of phototherapy for PR and to determine the optimal regimen for phototherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Short-term side effects of phototherapy include erythema, pruritus, dry skin, and blistering. Side effects of phototherapy are reviewed in detail separately.

In this report, a complete response at six weeks of follow-up was noted in 73 percent of patients in the treatment group compared with none in the placebo group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review identified a small (n = 40) unpublished randomized trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> (250 mg every six hours for fourteen days), which the authors of the systematic review felt to be a good quality trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Among the 34 evaluable patients, a higher percentage of those treated with erythromycin achieved complete cure of rash at two weeks (77 versus 6 percent). Patients treated with erythromycin also had greater improvements in itching.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to the above results, a trial of 184 patients with PR published after the above systematic review found no benefit with two weeks of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> (200 mg four times daily in adults; 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily in four divided doses in children) started within seven days of the appearance of secondary lesions of PR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The trial was not randomized, evaluators were not blinded, and the placebo was an emollient cream rather than a pill. No patient in either arm of the trial achieved complete clearance of lesions at two weeks, and there were also no differences in complete clearance between the arms at weeks 4, 6, or 8. Despite the methodologic issues with this trial, it is difficult to reconcile these results with the beneficial outcomes discussed above. The authors argue that earlier trials did not adequately identify a group of patients with a clear diagnosis of early PR.</p><p/><p>Also in contrast to the trials that support efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>, trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> for PR have yielded unfavorable results. For example, a blinded randomized trial in 49 children with PR found no statistically significant benefit to five days of treatment with azithromycin (12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, up to 500 mg per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. At four weeks, there were similar percentages of complete (60 versus 42 percent) and partial (28 versus 29 percent) responses with azithromycin and placebo. A randomized trial in 70 children and adults with PR also failed to find superiority of a five-day course of azithromycin (12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) over a multivitamin placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Similarly, clarithromycin was ineffective in a randomized trial in which 60 children and adults with PR were given one-week courses of clarithromycin (200 or 250 mg twice daily) or placebo pills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2733953025\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although treatment with systemic glucocorticoids has been suggested as an option for severe PR, the efficacy of this therapy has not been studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pityriasis-rosea/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The eruption commonly begins with a &quot;herald&quot; or &quot;mother&quot; patch, a single round or oval, rather sharply delimited pink or salmon-colored lesion on the chest, neck, or back, 2 to 5 cm in diameter. A few days or a week or two later, oval lesions similar in appearance to the herald patch, but smaller, appear in crops on the trunk and proximal areas of the extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87124%7EDERM%2F98333%7EDERM%2F87126%7EDERM%2F98332%7EDERM%2F99949\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87124 graphicRef98333 graphicRef87126 graphicRef98332 graphicRef99949 \">picture 1A-E</a>). The long axes of these oval lesions tend to be oriented along the lines of cleavage of the skin. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prodrome of headache, malaise, and pharyngitis may occur in a small number of cases, but except for itching, the condition is usually asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of pityriasis rosea is typically made based on the history of a herald patch and the clinical appearance of the rash. Laboratory testing is sometimes needed to exclude other conditions such as secondary syphilis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients do not require therapy. For patients with mild itching who desire therapy, we suggest treatment with medium-potency topical corticosteroids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
