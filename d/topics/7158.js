In addition to fever, myalgia, somnolence, headache, and nausea, rash occurs in most patients with meningococcemia. Early lesions may be macular, but rapidly increasing numbers of petechial or purpuric lesions can develop on the distal extremities and trunk, usually sparing the palms and soles (in contrast to RMSF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52107\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52107 \">picture 24</a>).

After an incubation period of as little as two days, fever, headache, malaise, conjunctival suffusion, and myalgia usually develop. In most patients, a rash appears within the following week, initially on the wrists and ankles and later on the palms and soles, before spreading centripetally to include the arms, legs, face, and trunk.</p><p>The differential diagnosis includes meningococcemia, infective endocarditis, measles, secondary syphilis, and other rickettsial diseases. The rash is at first erythematous and maculopapular.

Associated thrombocytopenia can make the diagnosis of RMSF difficult to distinguish from meningococcemia. However, several clinical clues favor the diagnosis of RMSF, including a history of tick bite or visits to areas where RMSF-associated ticks are present, occurrence of the rash a median of three to four days following the onset of fever, relative leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferases.

Conditions commonly associated with the development of necrotizing fasciitis include diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, injection drug use, obesity, and immunosuppression. The precipitating event is typically infection or trauma to the skin including abrasion, laceration, needle puncture, bite wound, ulcer, or surgical wound; hematogenous spread may also be responsible. These infections are often categorized as type I or type II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-and-rash-in-the-immunocompetent-patient/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Type I necrotizing fasciitis refers to a polymicrobial infection consisting of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria including facultative streptococci, enterococci, aerobic gram-negative bacilli including <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Proteus</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <em>Pseudomonas</em> (less commonly) and anaerobes including <em>Clostridium</em>, <em>Peptostreptococcus</em>, and <em>Bacteroides</em>. Fournier gangrene refers to a type I necrotizing fasciitis of the male (or female) perineum, usually due to disruption of the urethral or gastrointestinal mucosa, often in patients with diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-and-rash-in-the-immunocompetent-patient/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Type II necrotizing fasciitis is usually monomicrobial and is usually due to <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> or other beta-hemolytic streptococci<em>, </em>methicillin-resistant<em> S. aureus, V. vulnificus</em>, <em>Aeromonas hydrophila</em>, or <em>Clostridium </em>species.</p><p>Initially, patients present with a cellulitis that can progress rapidly with associated fever, warmth, swelling, edema, and pain out of proportion to the findings on the physical examination. Crepitus and a firm &quot;woody&quot; induration are classically described upon palpation of affected tissues. As the infection evolves, systemic toxicity can become prominent, cutaneous manifestations may include bullae and ecchymoses with necrosis, and cutaneous anesthesia may develop. Toxic shock syndrome develops in about 50 percent of patients with group A streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis.

Skin manifestations may provide the only early clue to an underlying infection, may be the hallmark of contagious disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may be an early sign of a life-threatening infection or serious noninfectious disorder. The differential diagnosis of fever and rash is extremely broad, but this symptom complex provides an opportunity for the diligent clinician to establish a probable etiology through a careful history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic approach is crucial for establishing a timely diagnosis, determining early therapy when appropriate, and considering isolation of the patient if necessary. Epidemiologic clues are important to pursue, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age of the patient</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Season of the year</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Travel history</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Geographic location</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exposures including to insects (especially ticks and mosquitoes), animals (both wild and domestic), and ill contacts</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immunizations and history of childhood illnesses</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immune status of the host (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Features of the rash are also important to consider, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Characteristics of the lesions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Distribution and progression of the rash</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Timing of the onset in relation to fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Change in morphology, such as papules to vesicles or petechiae</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptoms associated with the rash (eg, pain, pruritus, numbness) (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of infections characterized by fever and rash have a distinct seasonal predisposition. As examples, nonpolio enteroviral infections occur in the summer and fall months; Kawasaki syndrome, meningococcal infection, and parvoviral infections present most commonly in the winter or early spring months; measles and rubella are more frequent in the spring; tickborne diseases such as Lyme disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">ehrlichiosis/anaplasmosis,</span> and Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) primarily occur in the spring and summer; tularemia and plague are usually seen in the summer. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Season'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposures to food, water, plant materials, animals, and infected human secretions can lead to rashes and can be associated with both occupational and nonoccupational contacts. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Exposure history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thorough sexual history is essential in evaluating the patient with a rash of unknown etiology. Genital or rectal ulcerations may be caused by a variety of infectious agents, including syphilis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50385\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50385 \">picture 16</a>), herpes simplex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78603\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78603 \">picture 17</a>), lymphogranuloma venereum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73707\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73707 \">picture 18</a>), chancroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76843\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76843 \">picture 19</a>), and donovanosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58925\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58925 \">picture 20</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60432%7EID%2F68988\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60432 graphicRef68988 \">table 2A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Sexual history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several infections associated with fever and rash constitute emergencies that must be recognized promptly by the evaluating clinician. Such infections include meningococcal infection, bacterial endocarditis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, necrotizing fasciitis (including Fournier gangrene), toxic shock syndrome, and miliary tuberculosis. (See <a href=\"#H1084879368\" class=\"local\">'Selected fever and rash emergencies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic approach to the patient with fever and rash should focus on the appearance of the rash in addition to the detailed epidemiologic history listed above. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of the rash should include the following questions:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Was a prodrome present?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Where and when did the rash start?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>How has the rash progressed anatomically?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What symptoms are associated with the rash?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Has the rash changed in appearance?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Has any treatment been instituted for the rash? (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics of the rash'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In examining a rash, it is essential to characterize the lesions, both individually and collectively, according to morphology and arrangement (annular, linear, serpiginous, dermatomal, etc), distribution (isolated versus generalized, bilateral versus unilateral, symmetric, occurring on exposed areas, etc), and evolution (centrifugal versus centripetal). In addition, a differential diagnosis for fever and rash can be based upon the appearance of the rash and its accompanying signs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52167%7EID%2F63955%7EID%2F71663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52167 graphicRef63955 graphicRef71663 \">table 3A-C</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78412%7EID%2F54445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78412 graphicRef54445 \">table 4A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics of the rash'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate laboratory testing includes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonspecific tests such as complete blood count and urinalysis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood cultures (including specific media and isolation methods for work-up of bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms) should be inoculated prior to beginning antimicrobial therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serologic tests, when appropriate (eg, for <em>Coccidioides immitis</em>, hepatitis B, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, <em>Treponema pallidum</em>, dengue fever, and HIV)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antigen tests, when appropriate (eg, serum cryptococcal antigen) (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid from vesicular, pustular, petechial, ulcerative, and bullous lesions can be examined. Vesicular lesions should be unroofed so that the base of the lesion can be swabbed; herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus can be distinguished with rapid fluorescent antibody studies. Viral culture can also be performed. Aspirated fluid from pustules and bullous lesions should be Gram stained and cultured by the microbiology laboratory. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin biopsy can be particularly useful in establishing a diagnosis for nodular lesions but can also be obtained for petechial-purpuric, maculopapular, and ulcerative rashes. Biopsy material should be sent to the microbiology and pathology laboratories for appropriate culture and histopathologic evaluation.
