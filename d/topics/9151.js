Several days later, a fasting blood glucose value was 147 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. She has no previous history of diabetes, is alarmed by the possibility of having this disorder, and seeks your advice.</p><p>The patient has been treated for hypertension for 10 years, currently with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> 10 mg by mouth daily. She was once told that her cholesterol value was &quot;borderline high&quot; but does not know the value.</p><p>She denies symptoms of diabetes, chest pain, shortness of breath, heart disease, stroke, or circulatory problems of the lower extremities.</p><p>She estimates her current weight at 165 lbs (75 kg). She thinks she weighed 120 lbs (54 kg) at age 21 years but gained weight with each of her three pregnancies and did not return to her nonpregnant weight after each delivery. She weighed 155 lbs one year ago but gained weight following retirement from her job as an elementary school teacher. No family medical history is available because she was adopted. She does not eat breakfast, has a modest lunch, and consumes most of her calories at supper and in the evening.</p><p>On examination, blood pressure is <span class=\"nowrap\">140/85</span> mmHg supine and <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg upright with a regular heart rate of 76 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span>. She weighs 169 lbs, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. Fundoscopic examination reveals no evidence of retinopathy. Vibratory sensation is absent at the great toes, reduced at the medial malleoli, and normal at the tibial tubercles. Light touch sensation is reduced in the feet but intact more proximally. Knee jerks are 2+ bilaterally, but the ankle jerks are absent. The exam is otherwise within normal limits.</p><p>Fasting laboratory studies are as follows: glucose 141 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L);</span> sodium 143 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> potassium 4.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> chloride 103 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> and carbon dioxide 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L;</span> triglycerides 210 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> total cholesterol 222 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 73 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 107 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L);</span> and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) 8.4 percent. The urine <span class=\"nowrap\">microalbumin/creatinine</span> ratio is 14.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span>.</p><p>You conclude that the patient has type 2 diabetes, recently diagnosed. You suspect that the patient has had diabetes for a prolonged period because of evidence of distal sensory neuropathy on exam. Because of the elevated blood pressure values, you begin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> 5 mg daily and plan to stop the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> when the blood pressure is in satisfactory control. You note the lipid values and plan to reassess them when the patient's diabetes is in satisfactory control.</p><p>You counsel the patient about changes in lifestyle. You discuss medical nutrition therapy with the patient with the goal of preventing further weight gain and achieving appropriate weight reduction. You advise her to eat three meals a day (including breakfast), to control the size of portions, to reduce the evening snacks, and to limit her intake of fat. You refer her to a registered dietitian for individualized counseling about medical nutrition therapy and to a certified diabetes educator for teaching about diabetes. You also advise the patient to begin a regular program of exercise, and she agrees to walk for 30 to 35 minutes a day at least five times a week.</p><p>What medication would you prescribe for the management of the patient's diabetes?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>None. You wish to assess the effects of a trial of lifestyle change including medical nutrition therapy and exercise before adding medication.
