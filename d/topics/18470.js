The development of this vaccine was an important step in the successful eradication of smallpox, an infection characterized by fever, rash and constitutional symptoms, with a high rate of morbidity and mortality.</p><p>This topic will address the virology of vaccinia virus, available vaccines, vaccination procedures, contraindications, and adverse events. Vaccinia virus in the research setting is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaccinia virus in the research setting&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30687967\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attempts at control of smallpox began after it was noted that accidental exposure to smallpox by a scratch on the skin reduced the severity of infection. This led to the practice of &quot;variolation,&quot; which involved intentional administration of pustular fluids from smallpox scabs to uninfected persons. The practice of variolation began in China and India in the tenth century; deaths were reported as a complication of this procedure. </p><p>In 1796, Edward Jenner showed that inoculation with cowpox virus protected against smallpox and carried less risk of illness than variolation. Subsequently, vaccinia virus became the basis for the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=smallpox-vaccine-united-states-availability-limited-to-cdc-distribution-from-strategic-national-stockpile-in-consultation-with-local-health-department-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">smallpox vaccine</a>. The origins of vaccinia virus are uncertain. Successful vaccination was highly protective for development of any disease for five years and could protect from death or severe smallpox for up to 20 years. Periodic revaccination was necessary for optimal protection.</p><p>In 1959, the World Health Assembly adopted a program aimed at global eradication of smallpox. The development of stable, freeze-dried vaccine meant that vaccination programs could reach less-developed tropical countries. By 1967, efforts towards eradication were intensified.</p><p>Key components of the eradication strategy included surveillance, quarantine of infected patients, and vaccination of contacts and others living in the immediate area. Eradication was ultimately successful because smallpox has a long incubation period, which allows vaccination to modify the course of the illness. The lack of a reservoir for variola, other than humans, the ease of clinical diagnosis, and the fact that variola does not establish latent or persistent infection, were additional important contributors to the success of the eradication effort. By 1985, less than 10 years after the last reported case, routine vaccination against smallpox was abandoned throughout the world.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6604006\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccinia virus is a large, double-stranded DNA virus that carries out its entire life cycle in the cytoplasm of infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The virus is in the same family as variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox and monkeypox. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of smallpox&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monkeypox\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monkeypox&quot;</a>.). </p><p>However, unlike variola virus, which is easily spread through respiratory secretions, vaccinia virus is spread by direct contact through broken or abraded skin or mucosal membranes. The only natural host for the variola virus is humans. By contrast, the natural host for vaccinia virus is unknown, and it has the ability to infect numerous cell types from a vast number of animals. This property of infecting multiple cell lines from a broad range of species is one of the major reasons why vaccinia virus is widely used in research laboratories.</p><p>The virus has also been extensively studied as a model system to understand gene regulation and expression. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology and cloning, vaccinia virus became a research tool for the expression of foreign proteins in vitro and in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing foreign proteins may have future applications in vaccinating animals or people against infectious diseases or cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In recent years, many laboratories have been using highly attenuated poxviruses that do not produce infectious virus in mammalian cells. Because this type of virus does not produce infectious progeny, it has an excellent safety profile, even in immunocompromised hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These highly attenuated strains of vaccinia virus may become a future <a href=\"topic.htm?path=smallpox-vaccine-united-states-availability-limited-to-cdc-distribution-from-strategic-national-stockpile-in-consultation-with-local-health-department-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">smallpox vaccine</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6603831\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOTERRORISM AND THE SMALLPOX VACCINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The smallpox vaccination campaign was very effective. Administration of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=smallpox-vaccine-united-states-availability-limited-to-cdc-distribution-from-strategic-national-stockpile-in-consultation-with-local-health-department-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">smallpox vaccine</a> markedly reduced the smallpox attack rate compared with unvaccinated individuals (99.9, 99.5, 88, and 50 percent at 1, 3, 10, and 20 years after vaccination, respectively).</p><p>With the worldwide eradication of smallpox, routine vaccination with vaccinia virus is no longer performed. However, after the anthrax bioterrorism attack in October 2001, the United States government has gone to great lengths to improve preparedness for the intentional or accidental release of variola virus. Initially, this began with attempts to vaccinate a large number of potential first responders and healthcare workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. There has also been funding for the development and production of a modern day <a href=\"topic.htm?path=smallpox-vaccine-united-states-availability-limited-to-cdc-distribution-from-strategic-national-stockpile-in-consultation-with-local-health-department-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">smallpox vaccine</a> as well as the development of antipoxvirus therapeutics.</p><p>Because some laboratory researchers, healthcare workers, first responders, and military personnel are being vaccinated and a number of experimental vaccines employ the vaccinia virus as a vector, the complications from vaccinia virus vaccination are still seen. Also, as described in a brief report, people can accidentally be exposed to recombinant vaccinia viruses that are currently in widespread use as veterinary vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Smallpox as a public health emergency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of a case of smallpox would be a public health emergency.

Two to five days after primary vaccination, a papule forms and then becomes a vesicle two to three days later. The vesicle reaches a maximum size by day 8 to 10. A scab forms within two weeks leaving behind a scar when healing is complete. Mild fever and localized lymphadenopathy are often present during the first two weeks after vaccination.</p><p>Viral shedding from the vaccine site is highest during the first two weeks, but virus can still be cultured until the scab falls off. While a semiocclusive dressing may prevent contact and environmental spread of the vaccine, it is recommended to cover the vaccine site with dry gauze, which decreases secondary pox lesions around the inoculation site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Cutaneous inoculation has been performed for two main reasons.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The resulting scar served as a method to verify vaccination during the smallpox eradication program.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune responses to vaccine given by means other than scarification were found to be inferior.</p><p/><p>Vaccinated individuals maintain long-lasting cellular and humoral immune responses.

Concerns have been raised that variola virus might be used as a biological warfare agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Due to these concerns, some first responders have been vaccinated. In 2003, about 39,000 civilians in the United States were vaccinated in a government-sponsored Pre-Event Vaccination Program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, some countries choose to continue to vaccinate military recruits with vaccinia virus. However, this policy is not without risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>After a large outbreak of monkeypox in Africa that mainly affected children and young adults who had never been vaccinated against smallpox, there was some discussion about vaccinating civilians in the affected region who were at risk of exposure to monkeypox [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/23,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26-28</a>].

Although not recommended for this indication, VIG may reduce the incidence of postvaccinial encephalitis (from 13 to 3 cases in a randomized trial of over 106,000 Dutch military recruits) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Progressive vaccinia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive vaccinia (also called vaccinia necrosum and vaccinia gangrenosum) is the most dreaded complication of vaccination and was universally fatal prior to the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccinia-immune-globulin-intravenous-united-states-availability-limited-to-cdc-distribution-from-strategic-national-stockpile-in-consultation-with-local-health-department-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vaccinia immune globulin</a> (VIG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It occurs in vaccinees with immunodeficiencies such as agammaglobulinemia or T cell deficiencies, as well as those who receive immunosuppressive therapy including steroids or radiation therapy. After vaccination, there is progressive destruction of local areas of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and other underlying structures with metastatic lesions appearing at other cutaneous sites that can ultimately result in death.</p><p>This complication can occur after both primary and revaccination. In the 1968 national surveillance study, the majority of progressive vaccinia cases developed in patients over the age of 15 years who became immunosuppressed (two of five primary vaccinees and five of six revaccinees) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. All of these patients were given VIG, which appeared to decrease mortality. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Vaccinia immune globulin'</a> below.)</p><p>The efficacy of VIG was evaluated in a 2004 literature review of 64 patients with progressive vaccinia who were treated with VIG; no randomized controlled trials have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fourteen patients died, which represents a mortality rate of 22 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive vaccinia was lethal in infants despite treatment with VIG because they lack cellular immune function. In comparison, progressive vaccinia resolved after VIG in many adults with acquired immune deficiencies and in 8 of 14 with isolated hypogammaglobulinemia or agammaglobulinemia.</p><p/><p>In 2009, the first case of progressive vaccinia since 1987 was reported the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. The patient was a 20 year old military recruit who had undiagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

He received all available treatments for orthopoxvirus infections (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of complications'</a> below).

As a result, a history of eczema is considered a contraindication for vaccination. Individuals with other types of dermatitis are also at risk of eczema vaccinatum, and they should not be vaccinated until the skin condition is completely cleared. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p>The vast majority of patients developing eczema vaccinatum in both the primary and revaccination groups were infants and children in the 1968 national surveillance study, with only 20 of the 126 cases occurring in people over 15 years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66396\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66396 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. While usually less severe than progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum resulted in hospitalization in 60 percent of vaccinees with this complication; hospital stays were occasionally prolonged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Treatment with VIG may decrease the severity of and mortality from eczema vaccinatum, although there are no controlled trials evaluating efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/31,48,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,48,53</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Vaccinia immune globulin'</a> below.)</p><p>Individuals with eczema who come into close contact with a person who has been recently vaccinated can also develop severe eczema vaccinatum, presumably due to inoculation at multiple sites. Approximately 80 percent of contacts acquiring this complication required hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/33,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,54</a>]. </p><p>The first case report of eczema vaccinatum in the United States since 1988 was a two-year-old child with a history of severe eczema, who was hospitalized because of a generalized vesicular rash (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61125\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61125 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. The rash developed after he was exposed to his father, who had recently been vaccinated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=smallpox-vaccine-united-states-availability-limited-to-cdc-distribution-from-strategic-national-stockpile-in-consultation-with-local-health-department-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">smallpox vaccine</a> in preparation for military service. However, the history was not initially obtained by his doctors. </p><p>Due to the delayed diagnosis of eczema vaccinatum, the child's hospital course was complicated by hypothermia and hemodynamic instability. The patient was treated serially with intravenous VIG, mechanical ventilation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cidofovir</a>, and an investigational drug, ST-246 (now called tecovirimat) under an emergency investigational drug application. (See <a href=\"#H2169907457\" class=\"local\">'Experimental agents'</a> below.).</p><p>The patient eventually recovered and was discharged after 48 days of hospitalization. Given the rapid initiation of serial interventions, it was difficult to determine the potential contributions of each agent to the patient's recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The patient's mother also developed vesicular lesions on her face that were probably related to physical contact with her son's lesions. An environmental assessment of the home five days after hospitalization of the child demonstrated the presence of viable virus on household items (eg, drinking cup, toys).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized vaccinia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients develop a vesicular rash that can be extensive following vaccination. This complication is referred to as generalized vaccinia, which is usually self-limited and not life-threatening. Of the 143 cases compiled in the 1968 national surveillance study, the majority of cases of generalized vaccinia occurred among infants and children receiving primary vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, 9 of 10 cases that occurred in the revaccination group were in people 20 years or older. While no serious sequelae from generalized vaccinia have been reported, extensive scars can develop. Because of the generally benign outcome, no studies have evaluated the possible efficacy of therapies such as VIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Myocarditis and myopericarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac complications of smallpox vaccination have been reported since the initiation of vaccination in the 1950s in Europe. The complications range from asymptomatic T-wave changes to fatal myocarditis or myopericarditis. The cause of myocarditis and myopericarditis is unknown, but believed to be immune mediated. While this has yet to be proven, it was found that after vaccinations, some subjects developed a false positive test to syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>During the smallpox vaccination program of civilian first responders in the United States in 2003, 21 of 36,217 civilian vaccinees developed myopericarditis (6 per 10,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Among military vaccinees, the rate was lower (1.2 per 10,000), probably reflecting a highly selected, very fit population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The true incidence of myopericarditis is probably somewhat higher since these cases represented symptomatic disease, which limited duty. This complication has led to its inclusion on a black box warning on the ACAM2000 package insert.</p><p>The diagnosis and treatment of this entity is discussed elsewhere.

It usually occurred after autoinoculation of the eye or surrounding structures (74 percent). The importance of education of vaccine recipients about proper hand washing after bandage changes cannot be over-emphasized.

However, since VIG has a very low incidence of serious complications, prophylaxis is probably warranted in the above groups if vaccination is essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>A potential concern with VIG use in these patients is that it might attenuate the development of active immunity after vaccination. However, the available data suggest that VIG does not diminish the response to smallpox vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Similarly, treatment of mice with the experimental drug ST-246 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>] or CMX001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>] during smallpox vaccination did not compromise protective immunity elicited by the vaccine.</p><p>Some preliminary data suggest that there may be a genetic basis for adverse events after smallpox vaccination. Volunteers who received vaccinia virus vaccine underwent genotyping for 1442 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Genetic polymorphisms in two genes were associated with adverse reactions to smallpox immunization. Although further research is needed to confirm these findings, such an approach might allow screening before vaccinia virus administration to minimize complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6603780\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=smallpox-vaccine-united-states-availability-limited-to-cdc-distribution-from-strategic-national-stockpile-in-consultation-with-local-health-department-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Smallpox vaccine</a> helped to eliminate smallpox disease worldwide.

The virus is in the same family as variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox and monkeypox. (See <a href=\"#H6604006\" class=\"local\">'Virology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the worldwide eradication of smallpox, routine vaccination with vaccinia virus is no longer performed. However, after the anthrax bioterrorism attack in 2001, large numbers of healthcare workers and potential first responders were vaccinated against smallpox in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H6603831\" class=\"local\">'Bioterrorism and the smallpox vaccine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaccination with vaccinia virus is given by cutaneous inoculation with scarification, since this route of administration is associated with optimal cellular and humoral immune responses. In the United States, vaccinia virus vaccine is only available through the Centers for Disease Control. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Smallpox vaccination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious adverse events associated with vaccinia vaccine have included progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, myocarditis, pericarditis, and ischemic cardiac events. No further cardiac events have been described after the addition of deferral criteria for immunization, including a history of cardiac disease or risk factors for coronary artery disease (eg, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia).

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Postvaccinial encephalitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some self-limited complications have been associated with smallpox vaccination, such as the acute vaccinia syndrome, characterized by fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and fever and generalized vaccinia, which can lead to widespread vesicular lesions. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Acute vaccinia syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other complications include bacterial superinfection and accidental autoinoculation or accidental inoculation of close contacts. Vaccine recipients should be educated about proper hand washing after bandage changes to avoid contamination of other body parts, particularly the eye. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Accidental inoculation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any adverse event after smallpox vaccination should be reported to state health departments and the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS).
