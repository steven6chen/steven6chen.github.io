In order to recognize abnormalities that suggest ischemia or infarction, it is important to understand the components of a normal ECG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-basic-principles-of-ecg-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Basic principles of ECG analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with myocardial ischemia or infarction, findings on the ECG are influenced by multiple factors, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">Hyperacute/acute</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">evolving/chronic</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Size &ndash; Amount of myocardium affected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic location &ndash; Anterior, lateral, or inferior-posterior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Baseline (prior) electrocardiographic abnormalities</p><p/><p>For the purpose of this topic, ECG evidence of ischemia refers to abnormalities (which are sometimes referred to as &ldquo;changes&rdquo;) that are reversible once ischemia of the myocardium is no longer present. ECG evidence of infarction refers to abnormalities that are likely permanent and represent myocardial tissue that has been infarcted. This topic will present the classic ECG abnormalities seen with acute myocardial ischemia and infarction. It needs to be kept in mind that not all patients with ischemia or infarction will manifest all of the possible abnormalities and some patients may have none.</p><p>It should also be emphasized that the ECG can only suggest an acute or evolving MI. The accepted definition requires the detection of a rise <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fall of cardiac biomarker values. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Third universal definition of MI'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99423809\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC BASIS OF ST-SEGMENT DEVIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under normal conditions, the ST-segment is relatively isoelectric (ie, flat along the baseline), because healthy myocardial cells attain about the same potential during the plateau phase of repolarization, that is, during phase 2 of the cardiac action potential. Ischemia has complex time-dependent effects on the electrical properties of the affected myocardial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-tutorial-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Severe, acute ischemia lowers the resting membrane potential (that is, makes it less negative, inside relative to outside charge), shortens the duration of the action potential, and changes the shape of the plateau (phase 2) of the action potential in the ischemic area. These changes create a voltage gradient between normal and ischemic zones, leading to current flow between these regions during both systolic (due to changes in the shape of the action potential) and diastolic (due to changes in the resting membrane potential) portions of the cardiac cycle. These electrophysiologic fluxes, referred to as &ldquo;currents of injury,&rdquo; are represented on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) by deviations of the ST segment from the isoelectric (TP) baseline. The polarity and magnitude of these changes depend upon the location and the severity of the ischemic insult. </p><p>Although ST segment deviation in acute myocardial infarction (MI) is often referred to as a &quot;current of injury,&quot; we will use the terms &quot;ischemia&quot; and &quot;infarction&quot; in this discussion and do not define &quot;injury&quot; as a separate category of ECG changes.</p><p>When acute ischemia is severe (usually transmural), the ST vector is shifted in the direction of the outer (epicardial and subepicardial) layers, producing ST elevations and sometimes tall positive (or hyperacute) T waves over the ischemic zone. The shift in the ST vector is due, at least in part, to ischemia-induced shortening of the action potential duration. This pathologic early (accelerated) repolarization causes the outside surface of ischemic cells to become positively charged relative to nonischemic cells, which are still in a depolarized state (negative charge outside). The ECG is configured such that the ST vector always points away from electronegative and toward positive zones. In the setting described here, the ST vector will be directed toward the epicardium to produce ST segment elevation.</p><p>A so-called &quot;diastolic current of injury&quot; due to a lower (ie, more positive) myocardial membrane resting potential may also contribute to the appearance of ST elevation on the ECG. The ECG vector created by this voltage gradient will be directed away from the epicardium to produce the equivalent of TP segment depression. Because the clinical ECG is recorded with capacitor coupled (AC) amplifiers and the TP segment is used as the isoelectric baseline for measuring the other portions of the ECG waveform, this TP segment depression is not actually observed. Rather, lowering the baseline creates the appearance of greater ST-segment elevation. Thus, the observed ST elevation is due to both real ST elevation due to systolic currents of injury and apparent elevation of the ST segment due to TP diastolic injury currents.</p><p>When ischemia is confined primarily to the subendocardium (as during a positive exercise stress test in patients with coronary artery disease), the systolic ST vector typically shifts toward the inner ventricular layer and the ventricular cavity, while the diastolic injury vector points toward the epicardium, that is, the opposite of the directions observed with transmural (epicardial) ischemia. Thus, the overlying (eg, anterior precordial) leads show ST segment depression with ST elevation in lead aVR (attributed to potentials that would be recorded in the ventricular cavity) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65963\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef65963 \">waveform 1</a>).</p><p>Clinicians should also be aware that severe ischemia due to left main stenosis or occlusion may cause the ST vector to deviate toward the base of the ventricles, causing ST elevations in lead aVR and V1, in concert with ST depressions in multiple other leads. This set of findings also illustrates an important limitation in the clinical parlance that associates pathologic ST elevations or ST depressions with pure transmural or subendocardial ischemia, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-st-and-t-wave-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: ST and T wave changes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA AND INFARCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myocardial ischemia precedes acute myocardial infarction (MI) in all patients but not all patients with myocardial ischemia develop MI. The electrocardiogram (ECG), which is capable of detecting ischemia and infarction, evolves through sequential abnormalities (changes) in the transition from ischemia to infarction. ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia includes new ST-segment elevation or depression or the development of hyperacute T waves or T wave inversion (in leads in which they were previously upright). ST and T (ST-T) wave abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischemia may be present in many leads; more commonly, they are localized, although they do not always correlate with the involved region of the myocardium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99423500\"><span class=\"h2\">T wave changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated T wave changes in the absence of ST changes are less frequently seen with acute ischemia, except for the presence of symmetrically-inverted T waves after an episode of clinical ischemia (Wellens&rsquo; sign), which suggests proximal left anterior descending stenosis. (See <a href=\"#H466159\" class=\"local\">'Post-ischemic T wave inversions'</a> below.) T wave inversions are defined as &ge;0.1 mV in two contiguous leads.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99423333\"><span class=\"h2\">ST-segment depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ST depression is defined by a horizontal or down-sloping ST-segment that is depressed &ge;0.05 mV below the baseline, measured at 0.08 seconds after the J point, in two contiguous leads (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82922\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef82922 \">waveform 2</a>). The TP segment should be used as the baseline, and the PR interval used only if there is no obvious TP-segment. The strongest correlation with ischemia is with a downsloping or horizontal ST-segment depression. Upsloping ST-segment depression has a weaker correlation, as this type of ST-segment depression may be seen as a normal change with sinus tachycardia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99423345\"><span class=\"h2\">ST-segment elevation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To be considered pathologic, the ST elevation, measured at the J point, must be &ge;0.1 mV, except for leads V2 to V3, where it needs to be &ge;0.2 mV in men &ge;40 years, &ge;0.25 mV in men &lt;40 years, and &ge;0.15 mV in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-tutorial-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. ST-segment elevation can be caused by states other than myocardial ischemia however. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-st-and-t-wave-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: ST and T wave changes&quot;</a>.) Furthermore, not all ischemic events cause ST deviations exceeding these thresholds.</p><p>ST-segment elevation, associated with epicardial coronary vasospasm or actual occlusion, is a relatively specific sign of acute transmural ischemia. ST-T wave abnormalities that are suggestive of acute myocardial ischemia in the earliest phase of ST elevation MI are usually localized to those leads that reflect the involved regions of the myocardium:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>V1-V2 &ndash; Anteroseptal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>V3-V4 &ndash; Anteroapical</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>V5-V6 &ndash; Anterolateral</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I, aVL &ndash; Lateral</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>II, III, aVF &ndash; Inferior</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99423654\"><span class=\"h2\">Location of ECG changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It should be emphasized that these are ECG terms that do not necessarily correspond to exact anatomic location of the infarction as determined by imaging studies or postmortem examination.

Reciprocal ECG changes occasionally are observed during the initial period of the acute infarction, presenting with ST segment depressions in leads I and aVL. The ST segment depression in the precordial leads V1 to V2 may be reciprocal, but more likely represents true posterior wall involvement (which may be diagnosed by ST elevation in leads V7 to V9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-tutorial-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, there may be the presence of ST elevation in the precordial chest leads V1 to V2. Involvement of the right ventricle may occur with an inferior wall MI and is confirmed by the presence of ST segment elevation in V3R and V4R. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Right ventricular myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.) The amount of time when ST elevation occurs in the right precordial leads may be shorter compared with the inferior leads, and, therefore, a right-sided ECG should be obtained as soon as possible after inferior wall ST elevation is noted. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An acute posterior wall transmural MI reflecting left circumflex coronary artery involvement may be missed on a typical ECG. Posterior lead ECG (leads V7 to V9) should be completed if there is a high degree of suspicion or if ST depression is present in V1 to V3. The criteria for ST elevation in leads V7 to V9 are &ge;0.05 mV in men over 40 years and women and ST elevation of &ge;0.1 mV for men &lt;40 years.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99423541\"><span class=\"h2\">ST-elevation MI evolution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic (but not invariable) sequence of ECG changes in patients with STEMI is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first change may be a hyperacute T wave. It is tall, peaked, and symmetric (the normal T wave is asymmetric with an upstroke that is slower than the downstroke) in at least two contiguous leads. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initially, there is elevation of the J point and the ST segment retains its concave configuration but may become convex or rounded upward (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82020\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef82020 \">waveform 8</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over time, the ST-segment elevation becomes more pronounced and the ST segment changes its morphology, becoming more convex or rounded upward.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ST segment eventually merges with the T wave and the ST-segment and T wave become indistinguishable. The QRS-T complex can actually resemble a monophasic action potential. This is a &ldquo;current of injury&rdquo; or so-called &ldquo;tombstone&rdquo; pattern. Reciprocal ST-segment depressions are usually observed in other leads. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ST-segment returns to baseline, an initial Q wave develops, and there is a loss of R wave amplitude. When the ST segment elevation persists for greater than three weeks after the event, a ventricular aneurysm in the area may be suspected. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The T wave becomes inverted and it may remain inverted or return to upright.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over time, there is continued evolution of ECG changes. The R wave amplitude becomes markedly reduced, the Q wave deepens, and the T wave remains inverted or becomes positive. These changes generally occur within the first two weeks after the event; however, in some patients, they occur within a few hours of presentation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99423682\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-ST elevation MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ECG changes that occur in patients who sustain a non-ST elevation MI are different from those that occur with ST elevation MI. T wave flattening or inversion typically precedes ST-segment depression. Q waves are typically absent but can occur, and the duration of the ST and T wave changes are variable. The ST-segment is horizontal or down-sloping, &ge;0.05 mV in two contiguous leads, and frequently associated with T wave inversion &ge;0.1 mV in two contiguous leads and prominent R waves or <span class=\"nowrap\">R/S</span> ratio &gt;1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-tutorial-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466159\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-ischemic T wave inversions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After an episode of clinical ischemia, some patients develop T wave inversions &gt;0.5 mV in leads V1 to V4, and occasionally to V5. The T waves are frequently deep and symmetric, with QT prolongation. This ECG pattern is seen after the chest pain has subsided and there is a &ldquo;post-ischemic state&rdquo; with no features of ST elevation or depression. This is also known as Wellens&rsquo; sign. It is associated with proximal left anterior descending stenosis and impending acute anterior wall infarct, though it is also seen in those with intracranial hemorrhage and some cardiomyopathies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466175\"><span class=\"h2\">ST changes in the setting of conduction abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of left bundle branch block (LBBB), there are baseline ST-T abnormalities that can influence the ability to assess for ischemia. Three criteria have been developed to assess for ischemia in the setting of LBBB: ST elevation &ge; 0.1 mV in leads with a positive QRS complex, ST depression &ge;0.1mm in leads V1 to V3, and ST elevation &ge;5 mm with a negative QRS complex. In the setting of right bundle branch block or fascicular blocks, ST segment changes can still be interpreted normally. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-intraventricular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Intraventricular block&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIOR Q WAVE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prior myocardial infarction (MI) is characterized by initial Q waves that are deep (&gt;1 mm) and broad (&gt;0.03 to 0.04 seconds). The Q waves are more likely to be diagnostic of a prior MI if there is also an inverted T wave in the same lead. The location of these changes is dependent upon the location of the MI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-q-waves-on-the-electrocardiogram\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and diagnosis of Q waves on the electrocardiogram&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An abnormal Q wave is defined by [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-tutorial-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any Q wave in leads V2 to V3 &ge;20 msec or QS complex in lead V2 to V3</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two contiguous leads, Q wave &ge;30 msec and &ge;0.1 mV deep, or QS complex in leads I, II, aVL, aVF, or V4 to V6.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>R wave &ge;40 msec in V1 to V2 and <span class=\"nowrap\">R/S&ge;1,</span> with a concordant positive T wave (in the absence of conduction abnormalities).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior wall MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An old anterior wall infarction is characterized by the presence of initial deep and broad Q waves in any of the precordial leads (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66472\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef66472 \">waveform 9</a>). In some cases, there are no Q waves, but rather poor R wave progression across the precordium (the R wave amplitude does not increase progressively from leads V1 to V3, to V4, V5, or V6). This situation must be distinguished from other causes of poor R wave progression, including late transition (previously referred to as a &ldquo;clockwise rotation&rdquo; pattern) or a normal variant (often seen in women). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-miscellaneous-diagnoses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Miscellaneous diagnoses&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infrequently, there may be reverse R wave progression where the R wave amplitude becomes progressively smaller from lead V2 or V3 to lead V6. Similar to the electrocardiogram of an acute infarction, the location of the Q waves establishes the area of infarcted myocardium, septum (V1 to V2), apex (V3 to V4), or anterolateral wall (V5 to V6).</p><p>The ST segment typically is isoelectric.

If the Q waves are very deep (or complex), the axis appears to be rightward. This has been termed a &ldquo;peri-infarction block.&rdquo; However, if the R wave in these leads is small (ie, an rS complex), the rightward axis (&gt;+90&ordm;) is due to a left posterior fascicular block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-basic-principles-of-ecg-analysis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Basic principles of ECG analysis&quot;, section on 'Axis'</a>.)

There are usually inverted T waves associated with the Q waves. If the R wave amplitude is reduced, the QRS complex (Qr) may appear to have a leftward axis (&gt;-30&ordm; the left axis is actually the result of the infarction and not a conduction abnormality; it is known as a peri-infarction block). If the axis is very leftward (&gt;-30 &ordm; as a result of a small r and deep S wave [rS complex] in leads II and aVF), then this is a conduction abnormality due to a &ldquo;left anterior fascicular block.&rdquo; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-basic-principles-of-ecg-analysis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Basic principles of ECG analysis&quot;, section on 'Axis'</a>.)</p><p>It is not uncommon to see a Q wave in lead III only in patients who have not had an MI. The depth of this Q wave usually varies with respiration (respiratory Q wave). It represents a nonspecific normal finding. A diagnosis of inferior MI can only be made if there are also Q waves in either of the other inferior leads.</p><p>Q waves may resolve within one year after an inferior wall MI in up to 30 percent of cases.

Other causes for a tall R wave in these leads, including right ventricular hypertrophy, dextrocardia, Duchenne&rsquo;s muscular dystrophy, Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, lead malposition, or early transition (counterclockwise rotation), must be considered in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-miscellaneous-diagnoses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Miscellaneous diagnoses&quot;</a>.) The finding of Q waves and ST segment changes in leads V7 to V9 is helpful in diagnosing a true posterior MI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72039\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72039 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-tutorial-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p><strong>Septal Q waves</strong> &mdash; Septal Q waves are physiologic Q waves &lt;30 msec and &lt;25 percent the height of the associated R wave amplitude, seen in leads I, aVL, aVF, and V4 to V6. They demonstrate the normal pattern of initial depolarization of the ventricular myocardium from the left to the right of the septum and do not represent a prior MI.
