The median predicted survival for CF patients in the United States was 39.3 years (95% CI, 37.3-41.4) according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 2014 Registry Report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The usual presenting symptoms and signs include persistent pulmonary infection, pancreatic insufficiency, and elevated sweat chloride levels. However, many patients demonstrate mild or atypical symptoms, and clinicians should remain alert to the possibility of CF even when only a few of the usual features are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>An overview of the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of CF will be presented here. The genetics, pathogenesis, and treatment of CF are reviewed separately.

CF is increasingly recognized in nonwhite populations, not only in regions familiar with CF but also in South and East Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Prevalence estimates are likely to rise with increasing use of newborn screening and increasing recognition of individuals with mild disease or disease limited to one organ system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Classic CF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic or typical form of cystic fibrosis (CF) is diagnosed if a patient demonstrates clinical disease in one or more organ systems (as described below) and has elevated sweat chloride (&ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Most of these patients have disease manifestations in multiple organ systems (pancreas, upper and lower respiratory tract, and male reproductive tract). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Overview of clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonclassic CF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About 2 percent of patients fulfill diagnostic criteria for CF but have a normal or intermediate sweat chloride result. In these patients, the diagnosis of CF depends upon DNA analysis (two copies of a disease-causing mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator [CFTR] gene on each parental allele [ie, in <em>trans</em>]) or on measurement of nasal potential difference. This disease pattern has often been termed &quot;nonclassic&quot; CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, guidelines emphasize that there is a wide spectrum of severity in CF and that there is no clear distinction between &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;nonclassic&quot; types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The estimated prevalence and disease manifestations of nonclassic CF may change in the future, as diagnostic methods for CFTR mutations and dysfunction become more sensitive and are more broadly applied. </p><p>The term &quot;nonclassic&quot; has also been used to describe patients with clinical disease limited to only one organ system (eg, isolated obstructive azoospermia or chronic pancreatitis). However, this definition depends upon the stringency of the diagnostic methods used to determine clinical disease. Therefore, the sweat test-based definition of nonclassic disease can be applied more consistently and is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Patients who are first diagnosed with CF as adults are more likely to have nonclassic features, with normal or intermediate sweat chloride results, milder lung disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> little or no gastrointestinal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This group of patients also has a lower frequency of the common mutation, F508del (also written as delta F508, delF508, p.Phe508del, or c.1521_1523delCTT) compared with patients diagnosed with CF during childhood; they also have a higher frequency of unusual CFTR mutations, which are not included in the standard CF screening panel. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Molecular diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">CFTR-related disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of diseases can be influenced by the CFTR genotype but do not fit the criteria for diagnosing CF and depend upon non-CFTR genes and environmental exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These illnesses include chronic rhinosinusitis, idiopathic bronchiectasis, chronic idiopathic pancreatitis, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The risk for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is increased among individuals in whom only one CFTR mutation is identified, and also among patients with CF itself. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49145351\"><span class=\"h2\">CFTR-related metabolic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CFTR-related metabolic syndrome (CRMS) is a term that describes infants and children with an equivocal diagnosis following newborn screening for CF, and is found in 3 to 4 percent of infants with a positive newborn screen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In Europe, the term &quot;CF screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis&quot; (CFSPID) is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In particular, CRMS describes asymptomatic infants with positive newborn screening results and one of the following patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate sweat chloride results (on two occasions) and fewer than two CF-causing mutations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal sweat chloride results and two CFTR mutations, at least one of which is not clearly categorized as CF-causing</p><p/><p>The frequency with which CRMS is identified may be affected by the type of neonatal screening employed in a given state, and by the demographic diversity of the population. For example, during a six-year period, the newborn screening program in California identified 1012 infants with two CFTR <span class=\"nowrap\">mutations/variants,</span> of which 345 (34 percent) were ultimately diagnosed with CF; 533 (52 percent) were diagnosed with CRMS; and 132 (7.7 percent) were determined to be CF carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The high rate of CRMS was partially attributable to routine screening for 40 mutations (as opposed to the more typical 28), and to further evaluation with full gene sequencing in selected cases. In this very diverse population, more than 70 novel genetic variations were observed in the CFTR sequence, along with many other known, but uncommon ones. Determining the clinical significance of such sequence variations can be difficult, especially in the absence of obvious symptoms. Therefore, there was inadequate information to classify the patients as having true CF, or as carriers of a single mutation, and the CRMS label was used more frequently. This strategy leads to increased early identification of children with true CF, but increases the risk of falsely identifying children who will turn out to be carriers, or unaffected individuals. </p><p>Because the natural history of infants with these characteristics is unpredictable, CRMS is a provisional diagnosis. Some may go on to develop a positive sweat test and clinical characteristics of CF (although the disease is often mild) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; others may develop symptoms of nonclassic CF including isolated male infertility; and others may remain entirely asymptomatic. In one study of 29 infants with an initial diagnosis of CRMS, 48 percent were later diagnosed with CF, most within the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These individuals had a somewhat milder CF phenotype compared with infants who were diagnosed with CF by newborn screening. Consensus statements for evaluation and management of infants with CRMS have been published in Europe and in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a complex chloride channel and regulatory protein found in all exocrine tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Deranged transport of chloride <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other CFTR-affected ions, such as sodium and bicarbonate, leads to thick, viscous secretions in the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive tract, and to increased salt content in sweat gland secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17,19</a>]. The typical CF patient develops multisystem disease involving several or all of these organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76253\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76253 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An overview of these clinical features is presented below, and details of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management are discussed in the linked topic reviews. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59098960\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, most patients were diagnosed with CF after presenting with symptoms. Because of the expansion of newborn screening programs during the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of CF cases identified before presenting with symptoms. In 2001, less than 10 percent of CF cases were diagnosed on the basis of newborn screening programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]; by 2014, 63 percent were diagnosed by newborn screening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68042\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68042 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic presentation in infants and children &ndash; Prior to the implementation of widespread newborn screening in the United States, infants and children were typically diagnosed with CF after presenting with one or more of the following symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Meconium ileus &ndash; 20 percent of patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory symptoms &ndash; 45 percent of patients </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Failure to thrive &ndash; 28 percent of patients</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For infants presenting with meconium ileus, the median age of diagnosis was two weeks. For those presenting with other symptoms, the median age of diagnosis was 14.5 months (interquartile range, 4.2 to 65 months). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Infants with severe untreated pancreatic insufficiency occasionally present with a syndrome of edema with hypoproteinemia, electrolyte loss, anemia, and failure to thrive, due to malabsorption. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic disease'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prenatal presentation &ndash; Some cases of CF present with abnormal findings on routine prenatal ultrasonography, including hyperechogenic bowel. The risk of CF is highest if there is evidence of meconium peritonitis (scattered calcifications are seen throughout the fetal peritoneum), bowel dilatation, or absent gallbladder (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-echogenic-bowel\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal echogenic bowel&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-echogenic-masses-and-calcification-in-the-fetal-abdomen\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of echogenic masses and calcification in the fetal abdomen&quot;</a>). If these findings are present on fetal ultrasonography, we suggest offering the parents prenatal CF carrier screening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Carrier screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic presentation in adulthood &ndash; Patients presenting with CF later in life are more likely to have atypical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. One large retrospective cohort study of more than 1000 patients with CF found that 7 percent were diagnosed at age &ge;18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients diagnosed in adulthood were more likely than children to present with gastrointestinal symptoms, diabetes mellitus, and infertility. In addition, adults presenting with CF were more likely than children to have unusual genetic mutations, normal pancreatic function, and equivocal results on sweat chloride tests. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory tract involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typical respiratory manifestations of CF include a persistent, productive cough, hyperinflation of the lung fields on chest radiograph, and pulmonary function tests that are consistent with obstructive airway disease. The onset of clinical symptoms varies widely, due to differences in CFTR genotype and other individual factors, but pulmonary function abnormalities often are detectable even in the absence of symptoms. As an example, in a cohort of infants largely identified by newborn screening, 35 percent had respiratory symptoms (cough, wheezing, or any breathing difficulty); mean pulmonary function scores were abnormal by six weeks of age and declined during the subsequent two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As the disease progresses, patients develop chronic bronchitis with typical organisms, as discussed below. Repeated infections, with aggregation of inflammatory cells and release of their contents, causes damage to the bronchial walls, with loss of cartilaginous support and muscular tone, eventually leading to bronchiectasis. Disease progression includes acute exacerbations with cough, tachypnea, dyspnea, increased sputum production, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss. These acute events are associated with acute, transient loss of lung function that improves with treatment, but which lead to permanent loss of lung function over time. Digital clubbing is often seen in patients with moderate to advanced disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52839\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52839 \">figure 2</a>). The clinical manifestations of pulmonary disease in CF are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations of pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Transient infection of the airway with pathogenic bacteria often occurs early in life. Eventually, over years and varying widely among individuals, chronic airway infection with either Staphylococcus aureus or gram negative bacteria is established, often with radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis. S. aureus and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae are common pathogens during early childhood, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa is ultimately isolated from the respiratory secretions of most patients. Other microbes to which CF patients appear susceptible to colonization and infection include Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Burkholderia cepacia complex, nontuberculous mycobacteria (especially M. avium complex and M. abscessus), and the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. This predisposition to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection may be in part because of impaired clearance directly induced by a defect in CFTR.

Radiographs reveal panopacification of the paranasal sinuses in 90 to 100 percent of patients older than eight months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Nasal polyposis is seen in 10 to 32 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Sinus disease can present with chronic nasal congestion, headaches, cough caused by chronic post nasal drip, and sleep disturbance. Sinus infections can trigger lower respiratory exacerbation in some patients, although organisms found in the sinuses do not always match those recovered from the lungs.</p><p>Chronic rhinosinusitis may be associated with mutations in the CFTR gene even among patients who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for CF; these patients are said to have &quot;CFTR-related disease,&quot; as described above. One case-control study of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis found a significantly higher proportion of patients with a single CFTR mutation among patients with chronic rhinosinusitis than in the general population (7 versus 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Evaluation of a child with rhinosinusitis is discussed in a separate topic review.

An additional 20 to 25 percent develop pancreatic insufficiency during the first several years of life, so that most patients have fat malabsorption by one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Pancreatic disease tends to be progressive; many of the patients with apparently normal or marginal pancreatic function at birth will develop overt evidence of pancreatic insufficiency in childhood or adulthood. Clinically significant pancreatic insufficiency eventually develops in about 85 percent of individuals with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The remaining 10 to 15 percent of patients with CF remain pancreatic sufficient throughout childhood and early adulthood; these individuals are at risk for pancreatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Common symptoms and signs of pancreatic insufficiency include steatorrhea, characterized by frequent, bulky, foul-smelling stools that may be oily, and failure to thrive or poor weight gain due to malabsorption of fat and protein. In a patient with a clear diagnosis of CF, the diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency usually can be established based upon these clinical symptoms, a clinical response to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory testing (eg, fecal elastase). Infants with severe untreated pancreatic insufficiency occasionally present with a syndrome of edema, with hypoproteinemia, electrolyte loss, and anemia, due to malabsorption of macro- and micronutrients. Such patients also may present with symptoms caused by deficiencies of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Vitamin K deficiency can present as a coagulopathy, and vitamin D deficiency with rickets.

This can lead to acute or recurrent pancreatitis. Pancreatitis develops in about 10 percent of CF patients with pancreatic sufficiency but is rare among those with symptomatic pancreatic insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Conversely, 80 to 90 percent of infants with meconium ileus have CF, although premature infants may be more likely to have meconium ileus without CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Meconium ileus can occur in patients with a variety of CFTR mutations. A high familial recurrence rate suggests that other genetic modifiers predispose to the development of meconium ileus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

This perspective is supported by the following evidence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of randomized trials examining newborn screening in Europe and Australia demonstrated a 5 to 10 percent reduction in mortality by 10 years of age in children with CF without meconium ileus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several observational studies have shown that children with CF detected via screening demonstrate better lung function and improved growth parameters and require less intensive treatment than children diagnosed with CF on clinical grounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,69-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,69-76</a>].

However, improved growth and nutritional outcomes through adolescence have been documented in a randomized trial in which outcomes of children identified by newborn screening were compared with those diagnosed as infants based upon symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early nutritional intervention appears to improve neurocognitive outcome in infants and young children diagnosed with CF through newborn screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/73,79-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,79-82</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening programs also may be cost effective because of improved clinical outcomes. A study using the UK Cystic Fibrosis database compared the yearly costs of long-term therapies and intravenous antibiotics for children whose CF was identified through a newborn screening program as compared with those identified by clinical symptoms after two months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Treatment costs were significantly lower in the group identified by newborn screening. Similar trends were seen when the analysis was restricted to children with the common mutation associated with severe classic CF, delF508, suggesting that the reduction in cost was not due to finding only milder cases of CF.</p><p/><p>In addition to allowing early identification and treatment of individuals with CF, neonatal screening identifies a population for studying the mechanism of early (preclinical) lung injury. In the future, the effectiveness of novel therapies to delay or prevent the onset of lung disease could be assessed in these patients with preclinical disease.</p><p>Concerns were initially raised that newborn screening might be associated with earlier acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa because of earlier exposure to other CF patients within the medical system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. However, several subsequent studies showed that newborn screening is not a risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/85-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49141214\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborn screening typically employs two serial assays; infants with abnormal results for the first assay are retested with a second assay. The two assays used for newborn screening are serum immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) and DNA analysis for mutations in CFTR. IRT is used as the initial screening test in many protocols and is followed by a second IRT test on a different sample from the infant <span class=\"nowrap\">(IRT/IRT</span> protocol) or a DNA test on the initial sample <span class=\"nowrap\">(IRT/DNA</span> protocol). An <span class=\"nowrap\">IRT/IRT</span> screening protocol has somewhat lower costs but more delayed or missed diagnoses as compared with an <span class=\"nowrap\">IRT/DNA</span> screening protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IRT assay &ndash; IRT is a precursor to trypsin. In infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and pancreatic dysfunction, release of pancreatic enzymes is impaired, and IRT is not readily removed from the blood stream for conversion to its active form. Therefore, most infants with CF have elevated blood levels of IRT, which can be quantified by radioimmunoassay or by an enzyme&ndash;linked immunoassay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/77,89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,89,90</a>]. IRT levels fall rapidly during infancy. After eight weeks of age, negative result is not informative, although a positive result still strongly supports a diagnosis of CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/77,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,90</a>]. The initial IRT test is approximately 80 percent sensitive for detecting CF using typical cutoff values, and additional patients are not diagnosed through the <span class=\"nowrap\">IRT/IRT</span> protocol if a second sample is not returned for testing. In addition, the rates of false-positive and false-negative results are relatively high in many series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/77,91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,91,92</a>]. The test is primarily used for neonatal screening but also may be useful for small or malnourished infants, in whom the sweat chloride test cannot be successfully performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DNA assay &ndash; DNA analysis for mutations in the CF gene is used for newborn screening in most US states. This may be used as a secondary screen to confirm the diagnosis in patients with abnormal initial IRT assays <span class=\"nowrap\">(IRT/DNA</span> protocol), or it may be used as a primary method of screening. Many <span class=\"nowrap\">IRT/DNA</span> protocols use a floating IRT cutoff that improves sensitivity to as high as 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The DNA assays test for the most common CFTR mutations in the local population. The programs test for between 23 and 40 mutations, and some programs even perform adjunctive full gene sequencing. Screening for a greater number of mutations increases the likelihood of identifying infants with CF, but also increases the identification of rare or unique sequence variants, making interpretation of the result more complicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Infants with one or more mutations are referred for sweat testing, which further helps to identify children with true CF. The remainder may be diagnosed as carriers, or given the provisional diagnosis of CFTR-related metabolic syndrome (CRMS). </p><p/><p>Infants with positive CF newborn screening results should undergo sweat chloride testing to determine whether they have CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. For optimal accuracy, sweat testing should be performed when the infant is at least two weeks of age and weighs &gt;2 kg, using laboratory techniques stipulated by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Sweat chloride'</a> below.)</p><p>As newborn screens are now mandatory in all 50 states, individuals with CF are increasingly identified before they become symptomatic. It is important to recognize that some cases of CF will be missed by the newborn screen, with the rate varying depending on the methods used. This is a particular concern in patients who have with positive IRT on initial screen, but negative secondary genetic screens. Since only a limited number of mutations are evaluated on the genetic screens, it is possible to miss the diagnosis. Thus, it is important to follow such children closely through the first year of life, with particular attention to weight gain and recurrent respiratory infections. Clinicians should consider CF in individuals with suggestive symptoms, even when results of the newborn screen are negative or equivocal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49141207\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional variation in screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>National programs for newborn screening with various combinations of IRT and DNA testing are in place in Australia, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, France, and England [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/77,93-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,93-96</a>].

For newborns and young infants, a wide intermediate range is used. This is because sweat chloride concentrations in healthy newborns gradually decrease during the first weeks of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>], then rise slightly throughout childhood. Median sweat chloride concentrations in a healthy population rise from 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mMol/L</span> in mid-childhood to 23 <span class=\"nowrap\">mMol/L</span> in young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. It may be appropriate to use lower cutoff values for defining disease in young children, but such age-based reference ranges have not been adopted. Of note, European guidelines use the lower cutoff for the intermediate range (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> for all ages, but this does not change the classification of most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,105</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal &ndash; A normal sweat chloride result is sufficient to rule out CF in most individuals.

In this case, analysis of parental DNA can be performed to determine the nature of the CFTR mutation and clarify the diagnosis as a mutation inherited from each parental allele is required to cause CF, and occasionally more than a single CFTR DNA sequence variant may be inherited from one parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate &ndash; For patients with intermediate sweat chloride results, sweat chloride testing should be repeated. For asymptomatic infants with intermediate results, the sweat chloride test should be repeated at one to two months of age, and then at 6- to 12-month intervals until the diagnosis is clear. In symptomatic infants or children, or for infants who were younger than two weeks old when first tested, it may be appropriate to repeat the sweat chloride test sooner. Intermediate results of sweat testing also should be investigated with DNA analysis, using a CFTR multimutation method (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50886\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50886 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Despite the slight variations in sweat chloride concentrations with age that are described above, the cutoff of &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> is highly specific for diagnosing CF in all age groups. A variety of other clinical conditions may be associated with elevated sweat chloride levels, but none of these are readily confused with CF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78885\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78885 \">table 4</a>). Very rarely, apparently healthy individuals have sweat chloride values &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].

We also suggest DNA analysis because the results may affect treatment choices as well as confirm the diagnosis. Emerging treatment strategies target specific CFTR mutations, using CFTR modulators.

The test is performed by applying pilocarpine to the skin to encourage sweat formation. A small collection system is applied at the same spot to the surface of the skin, and the whole is covered in plastic wrap to promote sweating and allow collection of the sweat. A sufficient amount of fluid is usually obtained within about an hour. The test is painless but difficult to perform properly. The sweat chloride test must be carried out with extreme care and should be obtained by a laboratory that performs the assay regularly. Guidelines for diagnostic sweat testing are published by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF), and adherence to these guidelines is required for accreditation as a CF center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Improper technique can cause factitious elevation or depression in the sweat chloride level. Collection of insufficient quantities of sweat is a common problem, particularly in young infants; at least 75 mg of sweat (or 15 &micro;l using a Macroduct system) must be collected within a 30-minute period for the test to be valid. Hypoproteinemic edema and concurrent administration of steroids or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a> can lead to a false decrease in the sweat chloride concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Molecular diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermediate results of sweat testing should be clarified by DNA analysis using a CFTR multimutation method, and sweat chloride testing should be repeated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50886\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50886 \">algorithm 1</a>). Many experts also suggest DNA analysis in individuals with positive sweat testing for prognostic and epidemiologic purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Molecular diagnosis is usually carried out by direct mutation analysis. Most diagnostic laboratories in the United States screen for at least 23 of the most common mutations, using a panel developed for population screening by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65637\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65637 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. In a diverse ethnic population such as the state of California, a panel of 40 mutations is employed to include CFTR mutations found to be more prevalent in non-European ethnicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. If two CF-causing mutations are detected and the sweat test is intermediate or positive, the diagnosis of CF is confirmed. If two CF-causing mutations are not identified, the sweat test should be repeated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If CF cannot be definitively diagnosed or excluded, the infant is given the provisional diagnosis of CRMS. (See <a href=\"#H49145351\" class=\"local\">'CFTR-related metabolic syndrome'</a> above.) </p><p>The ACMG panel identifies approximately 90 percent of CF-causing mutations in the general population (and 97 percent of mutations in families of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. However, the panel may be less sensitive for other ethnic groups that have genetic diversity and a wider range of CF-causing mutations; in one study, it detected only 68.5 percent of CF-causing mutations in a Hispanic population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. Several state screening programs have therefore expanded or modified the ACMG panel to suit multiethnic populations.</p><p>For individuals with an intermediate or positive sweat chloride test result but in whom two mutations are not detected by the standard genetic screen, more extensive methods should be used to detect CFTR mutations. These tests include an expanded panel of CFTR mutations, evaluation for deletions or duplications (using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, MLPA), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> direct sequencing. These techniques are better able to identify rare mutations and are now readily available in several commercial laboratories at fairly reasonable cost. A list of testing laboratories is available through the GeneTests website (<a href=\"http://www.genetests.org/&amp;token=7+GJrCvx/pgnT2Hm8UDNmD1cCuCPE66OXT2WwXo7YM6HytDoOBCNvhvQzXj9/Q1u&amp;TOPIC_ID=6367\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.genetests.org</a>). </p><p>Additional information on genetic testing for carriers can be obtained from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.cff.org/&amp;token=bmTq7ZuIcyocF4e9UyYv8gN0xUdpqx98Oi7BGt9iuCY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6367\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.cff.org</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H5359539\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As newborn screening programs become more widespread, individuals with CF are increasingly identified before they become symptomatic. It is important to recognize that some cases of CF will be missed by the newborn screen, with the rate varying depending on the methods used. Thus, it is important to consider CF in individuals with suggestive symptoms, even in individuals who have negative results of the newborn screen. (See <a href=\"#H59099793\" class=\"local\">'Newborn screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweat chloride testing is the most important diagnostic test and should be performed to clarify a diagnosis of CF in infants with positive CF newborn screening results, in any patient with symptoms suggestive of CF, and in siblings of a patient with confirmed CF. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Sweat chloride'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most individuals, a normal sweat chloride result is sufficient to rule out CF. A sweat chloride value of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> or greater is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of CF, provided that it is confirmed by a second sweat test or DNA testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50886\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50886 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with intermediate sweat chloride results, sweat chloride testing should be repeated, and DNA analysis should be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50886\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50886 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88515\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88515 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DNA analysis should be performed for patients with intermediate or positive sweat chloride results. A standard panel is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis for most patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65637\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65637 \">table 5</a>); those with equivocal results should undergo an expanded DNA analysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50886\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50886 \">algorithm 1</a>). We also suggest that patients with positive sweat chloride results also have DNA analysis to confirm the diagnosis and because the results occasionally affect treatment choices. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Molecular diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain should be further evaluated at a CF center with specialized testing, including measurement of nasal potential difference <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consideration of other diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Nasal potential difference measurements'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry: Annual Data Report to the Center Directors, 2014. https://www.cff.org/2014_CFF_Annual_Data_Report_to_the_Center_Directors.pdf/ (Accessed on December 11, 2015).</li><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ratjen F, D&ouml;ring G.
