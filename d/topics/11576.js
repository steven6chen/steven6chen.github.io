The largest of these was a retrospective, international study from 19 centers in North America and Europe, which analyzed results in 935 patients who were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for muscle-invasive (T2 to T4a), clinically node-negative (N0) bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Chemotherapy consisted of GC in 64 percent of cases, MVAC in 20 percent, and other regimens in 15 percent. There were no significant differences in the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) with GC and MVAC (23.9 and 24.5 percent, respectively). These rates are lower than that seen the INT-0800 trial with MVAC, but this probably reflects differences in the underlying patient populations. While this study reflects patterns of clinical usage, a number of factors (case selection bias, variability of support, use of salvage therapy, variations in T staging, diagnostic work-up) can heavily influence the results achieved from the different regimens.</p><p>The most commonly employed regimens administered in the neoadjuvant setting are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic MVAC<strong> </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> on days 1, 15, and 22), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> on days 2, 15, and 22), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> on day 2), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</span> </sup>on day 2) administered every 28 days for three cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 30924 trial of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, this approach increased progression-free survival, but it did not result in a statistically significant difference in overall survival, although it suggested that toxicity was less severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Subsequent follow-up from that trial found that the overall survival rate at five years was 21.8 percent with dose-dense MVAC versus 13.5 percent with classic MVAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In both, eligible patients had clinical stage T2 to T4 muscle-invasive bladder cancer; patients with a single lymph node up to 2 cm in greatest dimension on imaging (clinical N1) were also allowed to participate.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study included 39 patients (43 percent with N1 disease) who were treated with four cycles of dose-dense MVAC treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Overall, 95 percent completed all four cycles of treatment. The pathologic response rate (pRR) was 49 percent (19 of 39 patients), with a pCR in 10 patients. At a median follow-up of 24 months, the disease-free rate at one year was higher among those who achieved a pathologic response (89 versus 67 percent among those without one; HR 2.6, 95% CI 0.80-8.1).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study included 40 evaluable patients (7 percent with N1 disease) who were treated with three cycles of accelerated MVAC therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The pCR rate was 38 percent, and another six patients (14 percent) were downstaged to non-muscle invasive disease at the time of cystectomy. A pathologic response to neoadjuvant MVAC therapy was associated with significant prolongation of both disease-free and overall survival.</p><p/><p>These studies demonstrate that dose-dense MVAC is active when administered in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Given the shortened time to surgery with the use of this modified regimen, we believe this represents another option and a reasonable treatment schedule, particularly in patients without evidence of clinical lymph node involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2959662713\"><span class=\"h3\">Classic MVAC versus dose-dense MVAC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>However, the data supporting dose-dense MVAC come from small studies, have the potential for case selection bias, and are limited by the lack of randomized trials to evaluate their equivalence compared with standard MVAC therapy in the neoadjuvant setting. In addition, although these trials allowed patients with node-positive disease to participate, we believe that such patients should not be treated with this modified regimen given the increased risk of recurrence and death associated with extensive node-positive disease. Instead, in the presence of node-positive disease, patients should be treated with standard MVAC treatment, which is discussed above. </p><p>In the current literature, there appears to be the use of common sets of nonrandomized patients in multiple reports in comparisons of outcomes of treatment with dose-dense MVAC versus classic MVAC or GC. A comparative effectiveness study of GC versus dose-dense MVAC in neoadjuvant therapy was actually a retrospective compilation of data from 212 nonrandomized studies, and thus subject to inadvertent case selection biases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, there does appear to be a gradual change of patterns of practice in favor of dose-dense MVAC because of the purportedly reduced toxicity in the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) randomized trial in the metastatic setting.

However, this was a single-center study, and it is not clear whether there was an impact from occult case selection bias, despite the very large number of cases reported.

Posttreatment surveillance depends on whether cystectomy or bladder preservation was performed. This is discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-approach-and-management-of-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H437732188\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial approach and management of urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Posttreatment surveillance'</a>). In summary:</p><p>Patients who were treated with cystectomy should be evaluated every three months for the first year, every six months for the second and third years, and then annually to year 5. After this, evaluations should be guided by clinical findings. The evaluation typically consists of lab work (ie, urine cytology, liver and renal function tests, and electrolytes) and imaging with computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE DIRECTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">p53 status for risk-directed clinical trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, p53 have been evaluated as a way to select patients for treatment. However, we recommend against routine study of p53 expression prior to neoadjuvant therapy outside an investigational setting.</p><p>Despite promising early data that had begun to influence clinical practice, the association between p53 mutations and a poor prognosis in bladder cancer has not been consistently demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/38-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-44</a>]. As an example, in one study involving 243 patients who underwent cystectomy for pTa to pT4B disease, the presence of p53-altered immunoreactivity compared with p53 wild-type was associated with a significantly higher risk of both disease recurrence and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Recurrence rates for tumors with and without detectable p53 immunoreactivity were 62 versus 7 percent for pT1 tumors, 56 versus 12 percent for pT2 tumors, and 80 versus 11 percent for pT3 tumors. However, other studies failed to confirm the prognostic significance of p53 mutation, and currently its role remains uncertain in view of the inconsistent and conflicting published data. Although there are occasional reports of nonrandomized trials that claim utility of p53 profiling, we believe that there is still no routine place for this outside the context of a clinical trial or investigative protocol.</p><p>One adjuvant trial attempted to select bladder cancer patients with pathologic organ-confined tumors positive for mutant p53 and randomly assign treatment with observation or adjuvant chemotherapy with MVAC (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>).

The Southwest Oncology Group is conducting a randomized phase II trial (S1314) evaluating the utility of a computer program that looks at a panel of cancer genes in a patient's tumor to predict whether it will respond to chemotherapy (CoXEN [CO eXpression ExtrapolatioN]) for the prediction of pT0 rate after neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. An emerging area of focus is the impact of mutations of DNA repair genes (eg, <em>BRCA1</em>, <em>BRCA2</em>,<em> ATM</em>,<em> ERCC2</em>,<em> RB1</em>,<em> FANCC </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]), which may correlate with response to chemotherapy. Another important innovation has been the demonstration of the importance of programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, connoting potential responsiveness to T-cell manipulation, in advanced bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In addition, it appears that PD-L1 expression after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with prolonged survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].
