It involves the activation of circulating and fixed phagocytic cells, as well as the generation of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory mediators. Sepsis results when the response to infection becomes generalized and involves normal tissues remote from the site of injury or infection.</p><p>The pathophysiology of sepsis and mechanisms of multiple organ system dysfunction are reviewed here. The definition and management of sepsis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sepsis syndromes in adults: Epidemiology, definitions, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5444041\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL RESPONSE TO INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The host response to an infection is initiated when innate immune cells, particularly macrophages, recognize and bind to microbial components. This may occur by several pathways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the surface of host immune cells may recognize and bind to the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of microorganisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are three families of PRRs: toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-oligomerization domain (NOD) leucine-rich repeat proteins, and retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases. Examples include the peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria binding to TLR-2 on host immune cells, as well as the lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria binding to TLR-4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (CD14 complex) on host immune cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PRRs can also recognize endogenous danger signals, so-called alarmins or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are released during the inflammatory insult. DAMPs are nuclear, cytoplasmic, or mitochondria structures acquiring new functions when released in the extracellular environment. Examples of DAMPs include high mobility group box-1 protein HMGB1, S100 proteins, and mitochondrial DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell (TREM-1) and the myeloid DAP12-associating lectin (MDL-1) receptors on host immune cells may recognize and bind to microbial components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>The binding of immune cell surface receptors to microbial components has multiple effects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The engagement of TLRs elicits a signaling cascade via the activation of cytosolic nuclear factor-kb (NF-kb). Activated NF-kb moves from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, binds to transcription sites, and induces activation of a large set of genes involved in the host inflammatory response, such as proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFa], interleukin-1 [IL-1]), chemokines (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1], vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1]), and nitric oxide.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) become activated and express adhesion molecules that cause their aggregation and margination to the vascular endothelium. This is facilitated by the endothelium expressing adherence molecules to attract leukocytes. The PMNs then go through a series of steps (rolling, adhesion, diapedesis, and chemotaxis) to migrate to the site of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The release of mediators by PMNs at the site of infection is responsible for the cardinal signs of local inflammation: warmth and erythema due to local vasodilation and hyperemia, and protein-rich edema due to increased microvascular permeability.</p><p/><p>This process is highly regulated by a mixture of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory mediators secreted by macrophages, which have been triggered and activated by the invasion of tissue by bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proinflammatory mediators &ndash; Important proinflammatory cytokines include TNFa and interleukin-1 (IL-1), which share a remarkable array of biological effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72271\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72271 \">table 1</a>). The release of TNFa is self-sustaining (ie, autocrine secretion), while non-TNF cytokines and mediators (eg, Il-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, platelet activating factor, interferon, and eicosanoids) increase the levels of other mediators (ie, paracrine secretion). The proinflammatory milieu leads to the recruitment of more PMNs and macrophages.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiinflammatory mediators &ndash; Cytokines that inhibit the production of TNFa and IL-1 are considered antiinflammatory cytokines. Such antiinflammatory mediators suppress the immune system by inhibiting cytokine production by mononuclear cells and monocyte-dependent T helper cells. However, their effects may not be universally antiinflammatory. As examples, IL-10 and IL-6 both enhance B cell function (proliferation, immunoglobulin secretion) and encourage the development of cytotoxic T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>The balance of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory mediators regulates the inflammatory processes, including adherence, chemotaxis, phagocytosis of invading bacteria, bacterial killing, and phagocytosis of debris from injured tissue. If the mediators balance each other and the initial infectious insult is overcome, homeostasis will be restored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The end result will be tissue repair and healing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1300788\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSITION TO SEPSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sepsis occurs when the release of proinflammatory mediators in response to an infection exceeds the boundaries of the local environment, leading to a more generalized response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59298\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59298 \">algorithm 1</a>). When a similar process occurs in response to a noninfectious condition (eg, pancreatitis, trauma), the process is referred to as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The focus of our review is on sepsis, but much of our discussion is applicable to SIRS. Definitions of sepsis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sepsis syndromes in adults: Epidemiology, definitions, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sepsis can be conceptualized as malignant intravascular inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant because it is uncontrolled, unregulated, and self-sustaining</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravascular because the blood spreads mediators that are usually confined to cell-to-cell interactions within the interstitial space</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory because all characteristics of the septic response are exaggerations of the normal inflammatory response</p><p/><p>It is uncertain why immune responses that usually remain localized sometimes spread beyond the local environment causing sepsis. The cause is likely multifactorial and may include the direct effects of the invading microorganisms or their toxic products, release of large quantities of proinflammatory mediators, and complement activation. In addition, some individuals may be genetically susceptible to developing sepsis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1301093\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects of microorganisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial cell wall components (endotoxin, peptidoglycan, muramyl dipeptide, and lipoteichoic acid) and bacterial products (staphylococcal enterotoxin B, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, and M protein of hemolytic group A streptococci) may contribute to the progression of a local infection to sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is supported by the following observations regarding endotoxin, a lipopolysaccharide found in the cell wall of gram negative bacteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endotoxin is detectable in the blood of septic patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated plasma levels of endotoxin are associated with shock and multiple organ dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50095\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50095 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endotoxin reproduces many of the features of sepsis when it is infused into humans, including activation of the complement, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. These effects may lead to microvascular thrombosis and the production of vasoactive products, such as bradykinin.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1300875\"><span class=\"h2\">Excess proinflammatory mediators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large quantities of proinflammatory cytokines released in patients with sepsis may spill into the bloodstream, contributing to the progression of a local infection to sepsis. These include tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), whose plasma levels peak early and eventually decrease to undetectable levels. Both cytokines can cause fever, hypotension, leukocytosis, induction of other proinflammatory cytokines, and the simultaneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72271\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72271 \">table 1</a>). The evidence indicating that TNFa has an important role in sepsis is particularly strong. It includes the following: circulating levels of TNFa are higher in septic patients than non-septic patients with shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], infusion of TNFa produces symptoms similar to those observed in septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and anti-TNFa antibodies protect animals from lethal challenge with endotoxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The high levels of TNFa in sepsis are due in part to the binding of endotoxin to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein and its subsequent transfer to CD14 on macrophages, which stimulates TNFa release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Complement activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complement system is a protein cascade that helps clear pathogens from an organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. It is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a>.) There is evidence that activation of the complement system plays an important role in sepsis; most notably, inhibition of the complement cascade decreases inflammation and improves mortality in animal models:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a rodent model of sepsis, a complement fragment 5a receptor (C5aR) antagonist decreased mortality, inflammation, and vascular permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In contrast, increased production of complement fragment 5a (C5a) and increased expression of C5aR enhanced neutrophil trafficking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In several animal models of sepsis (lipopolysaccharide injection in mice and rats, Escherichia coli infusion in dogs and baboons, and cecal ligation and puncture in mice), a complement fragment 1 (C1) inhibitor decreased mortality, inflammation, and vascular permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1302244\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most common form of genetic variation. SNPs are stable substitutions of a single base that have a frequency of more than one percent in at least one population and are strewn throughout the genome, including promoters and intergenic regions. At most, only 2 to 3 percent alter the function or expression of a gene. The total number of common SNPs in the human genome is estimated to be more than 10 million. SNPs are used as genetic markers.</p><p>Various SNPs are associated with increased susceptibility to infection and poor outcomes. They include SNPs of genes that encode cytokines (eg, TNF, lymphotoxin-alpha, IL-10, IL-18, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6, and interferon gamma), cell surface receptors (eg, CD14, MD2, toll-like receptors 2 and 4, and Fc-gamma receptors II and III), lipopolysaccharide ligands (lipopolysaccharide binding protein, bactericidal permeability increasing protein), mannose-binding lectin, heat shock protein 70, angiotensin I-converting enzyme, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and caspase-12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1301300\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC EFFECTS OF SEPSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Widespread cellular injury may occur when the immune response becomes generalized; cellular injury is the precursor to organ dysfunction. The precise mechanism of cellular injury is not understood, but its occurrence is indisputable as autopsy studies have shown widespread endothelial and parenchymal cell injury. Mechanisms proposed to explain the cellular injury include: tissue ischemia (insufficient oxygen relative to oxygen need), cytopathic injury (direct cell injury by proinflammatory mediators <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other products of inflammation), and an altered rate of apoptosis (programmed cell death).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant derangement in metabolic autoregulation, the process that matches oxygen availability to changing tissue oxygen needs, is typical of sepsis.</p><p>In addition, microcirculatory and endothelial lesions frequently develop during sepsis. These lesions reduce the cross-sectional area available for tissue oxygen exchange, disrupting tissue oxygenation and causing tissue ischemia and cellular injury:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microcirculatory lesions &ndash; The microcirculatory lesions may be the result of imbalances in the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, both of which are activated during sepsis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endothelial lesions &ndash; The endothelial lesions may be a consequence of interactions between endothelial cells and activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). The increase in receptor-mediated neutrophil-endothelial cell adherence induces the secretion of reactive oxygen species, lytic enzymes, and vasoactive substances (nitric oxide, endothelin, platelet-derived growth factor, and platelet activating factor) into the extracellular milieu, which may injure the endothelial cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) may also induce cytoskeleton disruption and microvascular endothelial barrier integrity, in part, through nitric oxide synthase (NOS), Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>Another factor contributing to tissue ischemia in sepsis is that erythrocytes lose their normal ability to deform within the systemic microcirculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Rigid erythrocytes have difficulty navigating the microcirculation during sepsis, causing excessive heterogeneity in the microcirculatory blood flow and depressed tissue oxygen flux.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytopathic injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proinflammatory mediators <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other products of inflammation may cause sepsis-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (eg, impaired mitochondrial electron transport) via a variety of mechanisms, including direct inhibition of respiratory enzyme complexes, oxidative stress damage, and mitochondrial DNA breakdown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Such mitochondrial injury leads to cytotoxicity. There are several lines of evidence that support this belief:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cell culture experiments have shown that endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), and nitric oxide cause destruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysfunction of inner membrane and matrix mitochondrial proteins, followed by degeneration of the mitochondrial ultrastructure. These changes are followed by measurable changes in other cellular organelles by several hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The end result is functional impairment of mitochondrial electron transport, disordered energy metabolism, and cytotoxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies using various animal models have found normal or supranormal oxygen tension in organs during sepsis, suggesting impaired oxygen utilization at the mitochondrial level. As examples, a study in resuscitated endotoxemic pigs found a supranormal ileomucosal oxygen tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], while a study in endotoxemic rats found an elevated oxygen tension in the bladder epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p>The clinical relevance of mitochondrial dysfunction in septic shock was suggested by a study of 28 critically ill septic patients who underwent skeletal muscle biopsy within 24 hours of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Skeletal muscle adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations, a marker of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, were significantly lower in the 12 patients who died of sepsis than in 16 survivors. In addition, there was an association between nitric oxide overproduction, antioxidant depletion, and severity of clinical outcome. Thus, cell injury and death in sepsis may be explained by cytopathic (or histotoxic) anoxia, which is an inability to utilize oxygen even when present.</p><p>Mitochondria can be repaired or regenerated by a process called biogenesis. Mitochondrial biogenesis may prove to be an important therapeutic target, potentially accelerating organ dysfunction and recovery from sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Apoptosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apoptosis (also called programmed cell death) describes a set of regulated physiologic and morphologic cellular changes leading to cell death. This is the principal mechanism by which senescent or dysfunctional cells are normally eliminated and the dominant process by which inflammation is terminated once an infection has subsided.</p><p>During sepsis, proinflammatory cytokines may delay apoptosis in activated macrophages and neutrophils, thereby prolonging or augmenting the inflammatory response and contributing to the development of multiple organ failure. Sepsis also induces extensive lymphocyte and dendritic cell apoptosis, which alters the immune response efficacy and results in decreased clearance of invading microorganisms. Apoptosis of lymphocytes has been observed at autopsies in both animal and human sepsis. The extent of lymphocyte apoptosis correlates with the severity of the septic syndrome and the level of immunosuppression. Apoptosis has been also observed in parenchymal cells, endothelial, and epithelial cells. Several animal experiments show that inhibiting apoptosis protects against organ dysfunction and lethality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11404774\"><span class=\"h2\">Mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis-induced multiple organ failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients dying from sepsis, light and electron microscopy as well as immunohistochemical staining for markers of cellular injury and stress, revealed that cell death was rare in sepsis-induced cardiac and renal dysfunction. Moreover, the degree of cell injury or death did not account for severity of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The presence of subtle mitochondrial morphological changes could indicate that mitochondrial energetic crisis (metabolic substrate utilization and mitochondrial OxPhos machinery perturbations) may be involved in organ dysfunction, in the absence of cell death. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11516984\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunosuppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical observations and animal studies suggest that the excess inflammation of sepsis may be followed by immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Among the evidence supporting this hypothesis, an observational study removed the spleens and lungs from 40 patients who died with active severe sepsis and then compared them with the spleens from 29 control patients and the lungs from 30 control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The median duration of sepsis was four days. The secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (ie, tumor necrosis factor, interferon gamma, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10) from the splenocytes of patients with severe sepsis was generally less than 10 percent that of controls, following stimulation with either <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-CD3/anti-CD28</span> or lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, the cells from the lungs and spleens of patients with severe sepsis exhibited increased expression of inhibitory receptors and ligands, as well as expansion of suppressor cell populations, compared with cells from control patients. The inability to secrete proinflammatory cytokines combined with enhanced expression of inhibitory receptors and ligands suggests clinically relevant immunosuppression. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ORGAN-SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF SEPSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cellular injury described above, accompanied by the release of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory mediators, often progresses to organ dysfunction. No organ system is protected from the consequences of sepsis; those listed included in this section are the organ systems that are most often involved. Multiple organ dysfunction is common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypotension due to diffuse vasodilation is the most severe expression of circulatory dysfunction in sepsis. It is probably an unintended consequence of the release of vasoactive mediators, whose purpose is to improve metabolic autoregulation (the process that matches oxygen availability to changing tissue oxygen needs) by inducing appropriate vasodilation. Mediators include the vasodilators prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO), which are produced by endothelial cells.</p><p>NO is believed to play a central role in the vasodilation accompanying septic shock, since NO synthase can be induced by incubating vascular endothelium and smooth muscle with endotoxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. When NO reaches the systemic circulation, it depresses metabolic autoregulation at all of the central, regional, and microregional levels of the circulation. In addition, NO may trigger an injury in the central nervous system that is localized to areas that regulate autonomic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Another factor that may contribute to the persistence of vasodilation during sepsis is impaired compensatory secretion of antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin). This hypothesis is supported by a study that found that plasma vasopressin levels were lower in patients with septic shock than in patients with cardiogenic shock (3.1 versus 22.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> even though the groups had similar systemic blood pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. It is also supported by numerous small studies that demonstrated that vasopressin improves hemodynamics and allows other pressors to be withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-vasopressors-and-inotropes#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of vasopressors and inotropes&quot;, section on 'Vasopressin and analogs'</a>.)</p><p>Vasodilation is not the only cause of hypotension during sepsis. Hypotension may also be due to redistribution of intravascular fluid. This is a consequence of both increased endothelial permeability and reduced arterial vascular tone leading to increased capillary pressure.</p><p>In addition to these diffuse effects of sepsis on the circulation, there are also localized effects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the central circulation (ie, heart and large vessels), decreased systolic and diastolic ventricular performance due to the release of myocardial depressant substances is an early manifestation of sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. Despite this, ventricular function may still be able to use the Frank Starling mechanism to increase cardiac output, which is necessary to maintain the blood pressure in the presence of systemic vasodilation. Patients with preexisting cardiac disease (eg, elderly patients) are often unable to increase their cardiac output appropriately.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the regional circulation (ie, small vessels leading to and within the organs), vascular hyporesponsiveness (ie, inability to appropriately vasoconstrict) leads to an inability to appropriately distribute systemic blood flow among organ systems. As an example, sepsis interferes with the redistribution of blood flow from the splanchnic organs to the core organs (heart and brain) when oxygen delivery is depressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The microcirculation (ie, capillaries) may be the most important target in sepsis. Sepsis is associated with a decrease in the number of functional capillaries, which causes an inability to extract oxygen maximally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73725\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73725 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. Techniques including reflectance spectrophotometry and orthogonal polarization spectral imaging have allowed in vivo visualization of the sublingual and gastric microvasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Compared to normal controls or critically ill patients without sepsis, patients with severe sepsis have decreased capillary density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. This may be due to extrinsic compression of the capillaries by tissue edema, endothelial swelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plugging of the capillary lumen by leukocytes or red blood cells (which lose their normal deformability properties in sepsis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the level of the endothelium, sepsis induces phenotypic changes to endothelial cells. This occurs through direct and indirect interactions between the endothelial cells and components of the bacterial wall. These phenotypic changes may cause endothelial dysfunction, which is associated with coagulation abnormalities, reduced leukocytes, decreased red blood cell deformability, upregulation of adhesion molecules, adherence of platelets and leukocytes, and degradation of the glycocalyx structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Diffuse endothelial activation leads to widespread tissue edema, which is rich in protein.</p><p/><p>Microparticles from circulating and vascular cells also participate in the deleterious effects of sepsis-induced intravascular inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endothelial injury in the pulmonary vasculature during sepsis disturbs capillary blood flow and enhances microvascular permeability, resulting in interstitial and alveolar pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. Neutrophil entrapment within the lung's microcirculation initiates <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> amplifies the injury in the alveolocapillary membrane. The result is pulmonary edema, which creates ventilation-perfusion mismatch and leads to hypoxemia. Such lung injury is prominent during sepsis, likely reflecting the lung's large microvascular surface area. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a manifestation of these effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-epidemiology-pathophysiology-pathology-and-etiology-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, pathology, and etiology in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The circulatory abnormalities typical of sepsis may depress the gut's normal barrier function, allowing translocation of bacteria and endotoxin into the systemic circulation (possibly via lymphatics, rather than the portal vein) and extending the septic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-67</a>]. This is supported by animal models of sepsis, as well as a prospective cohort study that found that increased intestinal permeability (determined from the urinary excretion of orally administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a> and mannose) was predictive of the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reticuloendothelial system of the liver normally acts as the first line of defense in clearing bacteria and bacteria-derived products that have entered the portal system from the gut. Liver dysfunction can prevent the elimination of enteric-derived endotoxin and bacteria-derived products, which precludes the appropriate local cytokine response and permits direct spillover of these potentially injurious products into the systemic circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sepsis is often accompanied by acute renal failure. The mechanisms by which sepsis and endotoxemia lead to acute renal failure are incompletely understood. Acute tubular necrosis due to hypoperfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoxemia is one mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. However, systemic hypotension, direct renal vasoconstriction, release of cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]), and activation of neutrophils by endotoxin and FMLP (a three amino acid [fMet-Leu-Phe] chemotactic peptide in bacterial cell walls) may also contribute to renal injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and etiology of ischemic acute tubular necrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Growing evidence suggest that septic acute renal failure is only in part sustained by renal hypoperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/42,69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,69-71</a>]. It has been shown that sepsis is associated with normal or even elevated renal blood flow, which is associated with redistribution of blood flow from cortical to medullary region. These macrovascular changes are associated with microcirculatory dysfunction, inflammatory response induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and bio-energetic adaptation response including tubular cell cycle arrest machinery. Hence, the mechanism of kidney injury during sepsis may be viewed as a bio-energetics adaptation of tubular epithelial cells induced by deregulated inflammation in response to peritubular microvascular dysfunction. </p><p>The role of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in septic patients has been evaluated both for renal support and immunomodulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/72-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-75</a>]. Retrospective clinical studies have suggested that early initiation of RRT and use of continuous methods are associated with a better hemodynamic tolerance and outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Timing and dose of RRT are ongoing sources of debate, yet available randomized clinical trials fails to demonstrate any beneficial impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].</p><p>Of note, likelihood of death is increased in patients with sepsis who develop renal failure. It is not well understood why this occurs. One factor may be the release of proinflammatory mediators as a result of leukocyte-dialysis membrane interactions when hemodialysis is necessary. Use of biocompatible membranes can prevent these interactions and may improve survival and the recovery of renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. However, these findings have not been universal or consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure#H3730476840\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis-related factors that may influence recovery of renal function in acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;, section on 'Infection risk'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central nervous system (CNS) complications occur frequently in septic patients, often before the failure of other organs. The most common CNS complications are an altered sensorium (encephalopathy). The pathogenesis of the encephalopathy is poorly defined. A high incidence of brain microabscesses was noted in one study, but the significance of hematogenous infection as the principal mechanism remains uncertain because of the heterogeneity of the observed pathology.</p><p>CNS dysfunction has been attributed to changes in metabolism and alterations in cell signalling due to inflammatory mediators. Dysfunction of the blood brain barrier probably contributes, allowing increased leukocyte infiltration, exposure to toxic mediators, and active transport of cytokines across the barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Mitochondrial dysfunction and microvascular failure both precede functional CNS changes, as measured through somatosensory evoked potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>In addition to these neurological consequences of sepsis, there is growing recognition that the parasympathetic nervous system may be a mediator of systemic inflammation during sepsis. This is supported by numerous observations in various animal models. Afferent vagus nerve stimulation during sepsis increases the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), ACTH, and cortisol; the last effect can be suppressed by subdiaphragmatic vagotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. Parasympathetic tone affects thermoregulation, as experimental vagotomy attenuates the hyperthermic response to IL-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]. Efferent parasympathetic activity, mediated by acetylcholine, has an antiinflammatory effect on the cytokine profile, with decreased in vitro expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and IL-18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. And, external vagal stimulation prevents the onset of shock following vagotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>], while an acetylcholine receptor agonist diminishes the pathologic response to sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-sepsis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>Delayed neurological consequences of sepsis, such as peripheral neuropathy, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5444006\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typically, a bacterial pathogen enters a sterile site in which resident cells can detect the invader and initiate the host response. The host response is initiated when innate immune cells, particularly macrophages, recognize and bind to microbial components. Binding immune cell surface receptors to microbial components initiates a series of steps that result in the phagocytosis of invading bacteria, bacterial killing, and phagocytosis of debris from injured tissue. These processes are associated with the production and release of a range of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages, leading to the recruitment of additional inflammatory cells, such as leukocytes. This response is highly regulated by a mixture of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory mediators. When a limited number of bacteria invade, the local host responses are generally sufficient to clear the pathogens. The end result is normally tissue repair and healing. (See <a href=\"#H5444041\" class=\"local\">'Normal response to infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis occurs when the release of proinflammatory mediators in response to an infection exceeds the boundaries of the local environment, leading to a more generalized response. It is uncertain why immune responses that usually remain localized sometimes spread beyond the local environment causing sepsis. The cause is likely multifactorial and may include the direct effects of invading microorganisms or their toxic products, release of large quantities of proinflammatory mediators, and complement activation. In this context, an anti-inflammatory response may reduce the toxic effects of the excessive inflammatory response, but may also compromise effective host protection from the infection. Some individuals may be genetically susceptible to developing sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H1300788\" class=\"local\">'Transition to sepsis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite a clear understanding of the inflammatory and coagulation mechanisms triggered during the early stage of severe sepsis, not much is known about the cellular aspects underlying the mechanisms that ultimately lead to organ dysfunction and death. Widespread cellular injury may occur when the immune response spreads beyond the site of infection causing sepsis. Cellular injury is the precursor to organ dysfunction. The precise mechanism of cellular injury is not understood, but proposed mechanisms include tissue ischemia (insufficient oxygen relative to oxygen need), cytopathic injury (direct cell injury by proinflammatory mediators <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other products of inflammation), and an altered rate of apoptosis (programmed cell death). The mechanism of organ failure in sepsis may relate to decreased oxygen utilization associated with mitochondrial dysfunction rather than or in addition to poor oxygen delivery to tissues. (See <a href=\"#H1301300\" class=\"local\">'Systemic effects of sepsis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cellular injury, accompanied by the release of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory mediators, often progresses to organ dysfunction. No organ system is protected from the consequences of sepsis. Those that are most commonly involved include the circulation, lung, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and nervous system.
