Many women, especially nulliparas, rate the pain of labor as very severe or intolerable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The pain of labor and delivery varies among women, and each labor of an individual woman may be quite different. As an example, an abnormal fetal presentation (eg, occiput posterior) is associated with more severe pain and may be present in one pregnancy, but not the next.</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) notes that there is no other circumstance in which it is considered acceptable for an individual to experience severe pain, amenable to safe pain relief, while under a physician's care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Many women desire treatment of intrapartum pain. ACOG supports the concept that maternal request alone is a sufficient medical indication for labor analgesia, and recognizes that there does not appear to be an increase of cesarean delivery with the various analgesic methods used peripartum.</p><p>Although lower levels of labor pain have been correlated with higher levels of childbirth satisfaction, higher levels of labor pain do not preclude an overall satisfying experience. When interviewed after delivery, mothers tend to downplay the intensity of their labor pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and it is not the most important factor influencing satisfaction with the childbirth experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, a sense of personal control over decision-making processes in labor has consistently been shown to correlate with overall maternal satisfaction with childbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. As an example, a study of 100 women undergoing vaginal delivery reported that satisfaction with pain relief was associated with a feeling of being in control and having input in the decision making process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>These findings suggest that women should be involved in the decision-making process regarding all aspects of childbirth, including pain relief, to increase maternal satisfaction. This can be accomplished by educating women about pain relief techniques during pregnancy, prior to the onset of labor, so that women can carefully contemplate their options before labor commences, as rational decision-making is difficult during times of emotional stress and physical anguish. Furthermore, patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) empowers the parturient by giving her direct control of her pain relief, and this has the potential to increase maternal satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>Issues related to labor pain and pharmacologic modalities for pain relief will be reviewed here. Specific issues regarding administration and complications of neuraxial anesthesia and nonpharmacologic approaches to manage labor pain are discussed separately.

The pain signal enters the spinal cord after traversing the T10, T11, T12, and L1 white rami communicantes. In addition to the uterus, labor pain can be referred to the abdominal wall, lumbosacral region, iliac crests, gluteal areas, and thighs.</p><p>Transition refers to the shift from the late first stage (7 to 10 cm cervical dilation) to the second stage of labor. Transition is associated with greater nociceptive input as the parturient begins to experience somatic pain from vaginal distention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Second stage of labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatic pain from distention of the vagina, perineum, and pelvic floor and stretching of the pelvic ligaments is the hallmark of the second stage of labor. The pain signal is transmitted to the spinal cord via three sacral nerves (S2, S3, and S4), which comprise the pudendal nerve. Second stage pain is more severe than first stage pain and is characterized by a combination of visceral pain from uterine contractions and cervical stretching and somatic pain from distention of vaginal and perineal tissues. In addition, the parturient experiences rectal pressure and an urge to &quot;bear down&quot; and expel the fetus as the presenting part descends into the pelvic outlet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF LABOR PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pain of labor produces physiological changes in addition to emotional distress and suffering (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55211\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55211 \">table 1</a>). These changes have an impact on many maternal systems, and also affect the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperventilation consistently accompanies labor pain. Arterial CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressures less than 20 mmHg occur commonly, and profound hypocarbia may inhibit ventilatory drive between contractions and result in maternal hypoxemia, lightheadedness, and rarely loss of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Respiratory alkalosis, which impairs placental oxygen transfer from the maternal to fetal circulation, may occur. Alkalosis shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, increasing the affinity of oxygen for maternal hemoglobin, thereby decreasing off-loading of oxygen to the fetus. Maternal alkalosis can also impair fetal oxygen availability via utero-placental vasoconstriction, which decreases uterine blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These changes are usually well-tolerated in healthy parturients with normal pregnancies.</p><p>Maternal transcutaneous PO2 as low as 44 mmHg has been observed during contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Epidural analgesia reverses the adverse ventilatory effects of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and results in an increase in oxygen tension in both mother and fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], which may be beneficial, especially when additional conditions contributing to fetal or maternal hypoxemia are also present. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurohumoral effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurohumoral responses to stress and pain may adversely affect placental perfusion and fetal oxygenation. Studies in sheep demonstrated that pain increased circulating catecholamines and significantly decreased blood flow to the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In pregnant primates, stress and pain were shown to lower fetal oxygenation, cause fetal acidosis, and slow fetal heart rate. These changes may be of clinical concern when other conditions contributing to fetal hypoxemia are also present. </p><p>Removal of the stressful stimulus or sedation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentobarbital</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> reversed these changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The adverse effect of elevated circulating levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> induced by maternal agitation and anxiety on fetal heart rate has also been documented in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Epidural analgesia results in decreased concentrations of circulating maternal epinephrine, probably by reducing maternal pain and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], which may be beneficial for patients with some medical comorbidities (eg, some cardiac lesions, preeclampsia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-labor-and-delivery-in-high-risk-heart-disease-general-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for labor and delivery in high-risk heart disease: General considerations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-preeclampsia#H3587243778\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the patient with preeclampsia&quot;, section on 'Advantages of neuraxial labor analgesia'</a>.)</p><p>Epidural analgesia also results in a reduction of plasma beta-endorphin and cortisol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychological effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to untoward physiological effects, unrelieved pain may also be a factor that contributes to the development of postpartum psychological trauma. Women who experience unrelieved pain during childbirth may be more likely to develop postpartum depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In a study of 1288 women following vaginal or cesarean delivery, the severity of acute postpartum pain, rather than the mode of delivery, correlated with the incidence of postpartum depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A more severe form of postpartum psychological trauma is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The prevalence of PTSD after childbirth has been reported to range from 1.7 to 6.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A larger percentage of postpartum women develop some posttraumatic stress symptoms, but not the full-blown disorder. Although the etiology of PTSD is complex and multifactorial, unrelieved pain during childbirth has been identified as a risk factor for its development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The profoundly harmful effects of postpartum PTSD on new mothers should not be underestimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LABOR ANALGESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic approaches to manage childbirth pain can be broadly classified as either systemic or locoregional. Systemic administration includes the intravenous, intramuscular, and inhalation routes. Regional analgesic techniques (neuraxial) consist of epidurals, spinals and combined spinal-epidurals, and are the most popular modalities for analgesia for childbirth. Neuraxial techniques are widely acknowledged to be the only consistently effective means of relieving the pain of labor and delivery. Local injection may also be administered to achieve paracervical or pudendal nerve block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pudendal-and-paracervical-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pudendal and paracervical block&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1130358893\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuraxial analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuraxial techniques provide unparalleled pain relief for labor and delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The use of neuraxial labor analgesia varies by country. In the United States, spinal, epidural, or combined spinal epidural analgesia is used for more than 70 percent of women who give birth, according to an obstetric anesthesia workforce survey published in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In contrast, according to the National Health Service Maternity Statistics for 2013 to 2014, approximately 31 percent of parturients in England had neuraxial labor analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Neuraxial analgesia may be indicated for patients with anticipated difficulty with intubation, a history of malignant hyperthermia, or some cardiovascular and respiratory disorders, and for prevention of autonomic hyperreflexia in women with a high spinal cord lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Neuraxial anesthesia is preferred for women with preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-preeclampsia#H2073240343\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the patient with preeclampsia&quot;, section on 'Labor analgesia'</a>.)</p><p>Absolute contraindications to neuraxial labor analgesia are rare. The risks and benefits of initiation of neuraxial blockade in laboring women must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Some relative contraindications include coagulopathy, infection of the lower back, and increased intracranial pressure.</p><p>Neuraxial analgesia for labor, delivery, and instrumental delivery is discussed in depth separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuraxial analgesia for labor and delivery (including instrumented delivery)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic analgesics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic analgesics are useful for patients who prefer less invasive techniques, or in whom regional techniques are contraindicated or not available. Although systemic analgesics provide an alternative to regional analgesia, they are not as effective and often have side-effects such as sedation and respiratory depression. The most popular systemic agents are opioids or mixed opioid agonists-antagonists. Nonopioid agents and inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> are used as adjuncts to opioid analgesia or in specific clinical circumstances. A list of systemic analgesics used in labor and delivery is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55888\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55888 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H680312190\"><span class=\"h3\">Opioid analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients desiring pain relief during labor are likely to be offered opioids when neuraxial analgesia is not an option. Opioids have the advantages of ease of administration, wide availability, lower cost, and are less invasive than neuraxial techniques, though substantial relief of labor pain is generally not achieved. A 2010 systematic review indicated that parenteral opioids (intramuscular or intravenous, including patient controlled analgesia) during labor provided some pain relief and moderate satisfaction with analgesia, although up to two-thirds of women who received opioids reported moderate or severe pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poor or moderate pain relief one or two hours after administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Opioid drugs were associated with maternal nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness. The review did not identify the ideal parenteral opioid for pain relief during labor and delivery. There is some evidence that in laboring women, systemic opioids such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> produce relief by inducing somnolence with little change in pain scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. A portion of the opioid dose also crosses the placenta, manifested in utero by decreased fetal heart rate variability and in the neonate by respiratory depression and neurobehavioral changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H680312314\"><span class=\"h4\">Patient controlled analgesia (PCA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of a PCA pump allows the patient to intravenously self-administer a programmed dose of medication with minimum intervals between doses. Although the analgesic efficacy of intravenous PCA does not match that of neuraxial analgesia, this method of opioid administration is the most effective option for the parturient in whom neuraxial analgesia is contraindicated, not desired, or not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. PCA provides rapid onset of analgesia, better control of pain relative to side effects than parenteral opioid injection, and a sense of control for the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In general, shorter-acting opioids are preferred in the labor setting to allow rapid changes in plasma levels to match the changing clinical need. We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> for PCA in labor because it provides the best combination of effective pain relief and low risk of side effects, although data are limited to a few small studies. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fentanyl</a><strong> PCA &mdash; </strong>Fentanyl is a short acting opioid which provides labor analgesia with a typical regimen of a 50 to 100 mcg loading dose and patient-controlled dose of 10 to 25 mcg every 5 to 10 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

It is metabolized by nonspecific plasma and tissue esterases, so although it rapidly crosses the placenta, it is metabolized rapidly in the fetus and should not produce neonatal depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

A dose initiated at the beginning of one contraction likely exerts its analgesic effect during the subsequent contraction, but parturients effectively learn when to self-administer a dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

In a trial comparing remifentanil PCA with epidural analgesia for labor, 9 out of 19 of the patients using remifentanil had episodes of apnea during the first two hours of PCA use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In another trial, approximately 1400 patients were randomly allocated to receive remifentanil PCA (30 mcg on request with three minute lockout interval) or epidural analgesia on request. For those who received analgesia, the area under the curve for pain relief was significantly higher for epidural analgesia, and oxygen saturation was significantly lower (SpO<sub>2 </sub>&lt;92%) in patients who used remifentanil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Thus, it is essential to closely monitor parturients receiving PCA remifentanil for oxygenation and respiratory rate. One to one nursing care should be strongly considered. We avoid prophylactic administration of supplemental oxygen as it may mask diagnosis of inadequate ventilation in patients monitored with pulse oximetry alone. In one study including parturients receiving IV PCA remifentanil, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring detected most episodes of apnea, while pulse oximetry missed most episodes of apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Supplemental oxygen should be administered if the parturient becomes drowsy between contractions, if the Sa0<sub>2</sub> falls below 95 percent, or if the respiratory rate falls below 10 per minute in a sedated parturient.

This method of administration continues to be offered in many locations where more effective neuraxial analgesia or PCA opioids are not available due to lack of skilled personnel, equipment, or cost considerations. The SC and IM routes are relatively safe and simple to use, but involve potentially painful injections, delay in onset, and variable absorption leading to unpredictable plasma levels. IV injection has a faster onset with less variability of peak concentrations, and thus the ability to titrate doses to effect.</p><p>We prefer to use IV doses of mixed agonist-antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nalbuphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nalbuphine</a> 2.5 to 10 mg IV) when neuraxial or PCA techniques are not options, as there is a dose ceiling effect with regard to respiratory depression in contrast to longer-acting opioids such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>.

Neonatal effects are primarily related to accumulation of the very long acting metabolite, normeperidine. Classic teaching is that meperidine should be administered within one hour or more than four hours before delivery as meperidine reaches a maximal concentration in the fetus from two to three hours after maternal dosing.
