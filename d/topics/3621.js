Use of the term &quot;islet cell tumor&quot; (which denotes the presumed origination of pancreatic NENs in the islets of Langerhans) has declined. In recent years, the term &quot;pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor&quot; or &quot;pancreatic NET&quot; has been adopted by most practitioners, as well as by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), for well-differentiated tumors regardless of histologic grade. The term pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is reserved for those cases with poorly differentiated histology and a high proliferative rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115945 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>NENs arising at different sites within the body are classified according to their histologic features. While there are differences in terminology and grading for these tumors arising at different sites, all commonly used classification systems reflect a basic separation between more indolent, well differentiated tumors and far more aggressive poorly differentiated types that behave clinically more like small cell carcinoma of the lung.</p><p>Measures of proliferative index, Ki-67 and mitotic index, are used to assign histologic grade for pancreatic NENs. Prior to 2017, well-differentiated pancreatic NETs were separated into low-grade (G1, Ki-67 index &lt;3 percent) and intermediate-grade (G2, Ki-67 index 3 to 20 percent) categories according to proliferative rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-localization-and-staging-of-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. High-grade tumors (G3, Ki-67 index &gt;20 percent) were considered equivalent to poorly differentiated carcinomas. However, it became apparent that not all G3 tumors were poorly differentiated and that some tumors, particularly with a ki-67 index in the 20 to 55 percent range, had relatively well-differentiated histology, relatively good prognosis (compared to poorly differentiated carcinomas), and relatively poor response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Therefore, the 2017 WHO classification of pancreatic NENs includes a NET G3 category (ki-67 &gt;20 percent) that must be distinguished from the poorly differentiated pancreatic NEC category (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115945 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This subject is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Pancreatic NETs that are functioning (hormone secreting) are classified according to the predominant hormone they secrete and the resulting clinical syndrome. Nearly all functioning NENs are well-differentiated NETs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system#H799428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology classification, and grading of neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in the digestive system&quot;, section on 'Functionality and nomenclature'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An insulin-producing pancreatic NET causing episodic hypoglycemia is considered to be an insulinoma.

For example, if a tumor stains for gastrin but does not produce symptoms of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, it is not considered a gastrinoma.</p><p>Although functionality may impact prognosis (eg, insulinomas are generally indolent tumors), the biologic behavior of most functioning pancreatic NETs is defined by the grade and stage of the tumor, as it is with nonfunctioning tumors. Thus, the pathologic diagnosis of a functioning pancreatic NET should be the same as for a nonfunctioning NET (ie, well-differentiated or poorly differentiated NET), with the descriptive functional designation appended to the diagnosis where there is knowledge of a clinical syndrome. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4808918\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are overall rare; they have an incidence of &le;1 case per 100,000 individuals per year and account for 1 to 2 percent of all pancreatic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-localization-and-staging-of-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H12145107\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12145114\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diagnostic imaging using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs offers whole-body imaging and functional information regarding tumoral expression of somatostatin receptors. Where available, functional imaging with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallium-ga-68-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a> (68-Ga DOTATATE) positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> is preferred over indium-111 (111-In) pentetreotide (OctreoScan) due to its greater sensitivity. However, sensitivity may be lower for the detection of insulinomas as well as poorly-differentiated or high-grade tumors. (See <a href=\"#H12145128\" class=\"local\">'Indium-111 pentetreotide (OctreoScan)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is highly sensitive for detection of occult, subcentimeter pancreatic NETs, and it plays an important role in the evaluation of patients with functional NETs that are undetectable using conventional imaging techniques. Through endoscopic fine-needle aspiration biopsy, EUS also offers the ability to obtain a non-operative histopathologic diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H12145121\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic ultrasonography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among patients presenting with hormonal syndromes such as hypoglycemia or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, the diagnostic modalities listed above (CT, MRI, SRS, EUS) can detect nearly 100 percent of pancreatic NETs. As a result, invasive localizing techniques (such as arterial stimulation with venous sampling) are rarely necessary in modern practice. (See <a href=\"#H12145135\" class=\"local\">'Arterial stimulation venous sampling'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to patients with suspected or biopsy-proven NETS is as follows (See <a href=\"#H4809019\" class=\"local\">'Overview of the diagnostic approach'</a> above.):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who present with hormonal syndromes suspicious for a pancreatic NET but who lack evidence of disease on conventional cross-sectional imaging, we recommend endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). EUS with fine-needle aspiration can also be used to establish a pathologic diagnosis, particularly in patients with early-stage disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who present with a biopsy-proven well-differentiated NET in the pancreas, we recommend helical triple-phase CT (arterial phase, portal venous phase, noncontrast) or multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI of the abdomen to stage the extent of disease. If the results would potentially change management or the treatment plan, we perform diagnostic imaging with a radiolabeled somatostatin analog in order to assess for somatostatin-receptor expression and evaluate for extra-abdominal (predominantly bone) metastases. Where available, functional imaging with 68-Ga DOTATATE <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is preferred over 111-In pentetreotide (OctreoScan) due to its greater sensitivity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In rare cases where there is strong clinical and biochemical evidence for an occult pancreatic NET that is undetectable on EUS, we recommend arterial stimulation with hepatic venous sampling if expertise in this technique is available. (See <a href=\"#H12145135\" class=\"local\">'Arterial stimulation venous sampling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromogranin A (CgA) is the most commonly secreted and measured hormone associated with all types of gastroenteropancreatic NETs. CgA or pancreatic polypeptide can be followed as tumor markers if elevated at baseline. False positive elevations of CgA are often seen in patients taking proton pump inhibitors. For patients with functioning pancreatic NETs, the levels of the secreted hormone represent a more specific tumor marker. (See <a href=\"#H24623272\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory diagnostics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong> &mdash; The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Stephen Goldfinger, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Rindi G, Arnold R, Bosman FT, et al.
