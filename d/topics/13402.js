This tissue (called the &quot;pericardium&quot;) forms a sac that protects the heart and keeps it from rubbing against other nearby organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69323\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69323 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Pericarditis is rare in children. Children who have certain medical conditions have a higher risk of getting it. These conditions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An infection with a virus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A disease called &quot;lupus&quot; &ndash; In this disease, the body's infection-fighting system, called the &quot;immune system,&quot; attacks the body's own healthy tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery for a heart condition the child was born with &ndash; Fluid sometimes builds up around the heart after surgery. This can cause pericarditis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101390559\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of pericarditis in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling weak or tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having trouble breathing</p><p/><p>Chest pain is the most common symptom of pericarditis. It can be a sharp pain or a dull ache. Your child might have pain in the front of the chest, the shoulder, or the upper back.</p><p>If your child has sharp chest pain, it might get worse when he or she takes a deep breath. This pain might get better when your child sits up and leans forward.</p><p>Many other conditions can cause chest pain and fever in children. Because pericarditis is rare, a different condition could be causing these symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101390574\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Take your child to the doctor or nurse if he or she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is a baby, and gets sweaty when breastfeeding or bottle feeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has swelling in the legs or other parts of the body</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101390591\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask about your child&rsquo;s symptoms. He or she can do one or more of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your child's heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create a picture of your child's heart as it beats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray &ndash; This test can show if there is a large amount of fluid around your child's heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; These measure the levels of certain proteins in the blood. The protein levels are a clue to the health of your child's heart. They can also tell the doctor if your child has a disease that is causing the pericarditis, and if the pericarditis is improving.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101390608\"><span class=\"h1\">How is pericarditis in children treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments for pericarditis in children depend on the cause. Treatments might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to reduce pain and inflammation, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or indomethacin (brand name: Indocin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid medicines to reduce inflammation (not the same steroids athletes take to build up muscle)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics (if an infection is causing the pericarditis) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Draining extra fluid from around the heart &ndash; Doctors do this with a thin needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest</p><p/><p>If your child needs more treatment, the doctor can do surgery to remove swollen, irritated tissue from around the heart.</p><p>If doctors do not already know what is causing your child's pericarditis, they will look for the cause and treat it, if possible. This can help the pericarditis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101390623\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericarditis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pericarditis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pleuritic-chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pleuritic chest pain (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericarditis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pericarditis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
