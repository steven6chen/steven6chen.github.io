Bradycardia is caused by intrinsic dysfunction or injury to the heart's conduction system or by extrinsic factors acting on a normal heart and its conduction system.

The components of the conduction system include the sinus node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and the His-Purkinje system (His bundle) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63340\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63340 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The sinus node is the pacemaker of the heart and is located in the sulcus terminalis at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium. Specialized cells (nodal or dominant cells) within the sinus node depolarize spontaneously, which initiates an electrical impulse that spreads to the AV node and through the atria, resulting in bilateral atrial contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bradycardia-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At the AV node, the impulse is conducted through to the bundle of His. The His bundle courses through the region of the membranous septum and divides thereafter into the right and left bundle branches. Electrical activation through an intact His bundle and bundle branches results in nearly simultaneous contraction of the right and left ventricles.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe bradycardia have insufficient cardiac output and poor peripheral perfusion. They require immediate medical attention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52446\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef52446 \">algorithm 1</a>). Acute management includes assessing and restoring the cardio-respiratory state and identifying reversible causes of bradycardia. Medical management includes administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atropine</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac pacing. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Poor perfusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bradycardia may be caused by intrinsic dysfunction or injury to the heart's conduction system, or by extrinsic factors acting on a normal heart and its conduction system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65427\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65427 \">table 2</a>). The most common causes in children include increased vagal tone, medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102555\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102555 \">table 3</a>), and corrective surgery of congenital heart disease (CHD). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Causes of bradycardia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most children with bradycardia are asymptomatic. In infants and preverbal children, symptoms, when present, may be nonspecific, including lethargy, poor feeding, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> seizures. Older children and adolescents will complain of dizziness, fatigue, exercise intolerance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> syncope. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of the child with bradycardia includes a medical history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Additional studies that may be useful include 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring, echocardiogram, exercise stress testing, and, rarely, invasive electrophysiology testing. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52675\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef52675 \">waveform 1</a>) is a common finding in normal children. No additional evaluation or treatment is needed in children with sinus bradycardia who are asymptomatic and otherwise healthy. Increased vagal tone can cause sinus bradycardia that may be symptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H2223777\" class=\"local\">'Sinus bradycardia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2225029\" class=\"local\">'Hypervagotonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus nodal dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78649\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef78649 \">waveform 2</a>), defined as inappropriate sinus bradycardia or inability to appropriately elevate the heart rate in response to physiological stress, can be caused by congenital, familial, or cardiac disease. It can also be acquired from direct injury (surgery), inflammation (myocarditis), or medications. Pacemaker placement may be warranted for management of sinus node dysfunction in symptomatic patients and those with underlying CHD. (See <a href=\"#H2226292\" class=\"local\">'Sinus node dysfunction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2225453\" class=\"local\">'Chronic symptomatic bradycardia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrioventricular (AV) heart block is the delay or interruption in the transmission of an atrial impulse to the ventricles. It is categorized as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>First degree AV block (slowed conduction without missed beats (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67882\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67882 \">waveform 3</a>)) is frequently observed in healthy asymptomatic children and does not cause bradycardia. (See <a href=\"#H2223783\" class=\"local\">'First degree AV block'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Second degree AV block (intermittent conduction with missed beats) includes Mobitz type 1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73051\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73051 \">waveform 4</a>) and 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79539\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef79539 \">waveform 5</a>). Patients with Mobitz type 1 block are generally asymptomatic. Children with Mobitz type 2 block are more likely to have underlying cardiac disease and are at increased risk to progress to complete heart block. In some children with advanced second degree AV block, pacemaker placement may be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H2223796\" class=\"local\">'Second degree AV block'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2225453\" class=\"local\">'Chronic symptomatic bradycardia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Third degree or complete block (absent conduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63951\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63951 \">waveform 6</a>)) can be congenital or acquired. In the neonate, the most common cause is neonatal lupus. Pacemaker placement is recommended in most cases of complete heart block and yearly echocardiograms are needed to monitor for development of cardiomyopathy. The mortality rate among children with untreated complete block is 5 to 8 percent. (See <a href=\"#H2223842\" class=\"local\">'Third degree AV block'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2229068\" class=\"local\">'Complete heart block and/or CHD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pacemaker implantation is the treatment of choice for chronic therapy for symptomatic bradycardia.
