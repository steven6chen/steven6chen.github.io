These studies are complemented by randomized trials and studies of nutrient action in animal models, which have led to changing dietary guidelines around the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although guidelines vary from country to country, recommendations from different parts of the world share similarities in terms of the emphasis on certain types of foods and nutrients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p>This topic will review important components of a healthy diet. Dietary assessment and diets for specific populations are discussed elsewhere.

Overnutrition leading to overweight and obesity is the single most important dietary factor associated with poor health outcomes. It is associated with premature mortality as well as increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and other important conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with normal weight, caloric intake should equal energy expenditure. Balancing caloric intake requires that many individuals limit their typical calorie consumption, while also engaging in physical activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The benefits and risks of exercise&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Calculating total energy expenditure for recommended daily caloric intake is based on age, sex, weight, and activity level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F107834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107834 \">table 1</a>). Calculating one's actual daily caloric intake can be aided by using 24-hour dietary recall, a food diary, or other assessment tools to determine caloric intake of different foods and beverages. Assessment tools, including consumer-focused apps and online tools that can help patients readily track what they eat and drink, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-assessment-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary assessment in adults&quot;, section on 'Assessment tools'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H948339\"><span class=\"h1\">MACRONUTRIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Macronutrients are the chemical compounds consumed in the largest quantities and provide bulk energy. The three primary macronutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Fiber can also be considered a macronutrient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H948347\"><span class=\"h2\">Carbohydrate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbohydrates should make up 45 to 65 percent of total caloric intake, as recommended by the United States Dietary Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Both the quantity and type of carbohydrate (eg, whole-grain versus refined-grain) have differential effects on postprandial glucose levels and glycemic index. Several prospective studies have associated diets high in glycemic index with risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and some cancers. Glycemic index for common foods are available in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71978 \">table 2</a>). One important way of achieving a healthy diet is to replace carbohydrates having a high glycemic index (eg, white rice, pancakes) with a low glycemic index (eg, fruits, vegetables).</p><p>Added sugars should be limited and comprise no more than 10 percent of total calories consumed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These sugars often come from sweetened beverages and almost all processed foods. If a large percentage of calories comes from added sugars, it may be difficult for patients to meet their nutritional needs within caloric limits. Naturally occurring sugars (eg, from fruit or milk) are not considered added sugars. However, fruit juice should still be limited to small daily amounts, if any, as it tends to be high in calories without the added benefit of fiber, which is found in whole fruit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-carbohydrates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary carbohydrates&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H26714245\" class=\"local\">'Sweetened beverages'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H950468\"><span class=\"h2\">Protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protein should make up 10 to 35 percent of total caloric intake, as recommended by the United States Dietary Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Individuals should be counseled to eat a variety of healthy protein-rich foods, including fish, lean meat, poultry, eggs, beans, peas, soy products, and unsalted nuts and seeds. Patients should be advised to avoid protein sources with unhealthy fats. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-fat#H626354751\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary fat&quot;, section on 'Recommendations for patients'</a>.)</p><p>Common sources of dietary protein include whole foods (eg, meat, fish, egg, vegetables, milk) and protein powders (eg, casein, whey, soy). The source of protein has a differential effect on health (eg, red meats are associated with increased mortality, compared with white meats). (See <a href=\"#H950600\" class=\"local\">'Protein-rich foods'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H948361\"><span class=\"h2\">Fat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fat should make up 20 to 35 percent of total caloric intake, as recommended by the United States Dietary Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The type of fat consumed appears to be more important than the amount of total fat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75539\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75539 \">table 3</a>). Trans fats contribute to coronary heart disease (CHD), while n-3 (and perhaps n-6) polyunsaturated fats are protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-fat#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary fat&quot;, section on 'Type of fat'</a>.)</p><p>Trans fatty acid consumption should be kept as low as possible. The major sources of trans fats include margarines and partially hydrogenated vegetable fats. These fats are also present in many processed and fast foods. The United States Dietary Guidelines recommend limiting dietary cholesterol and keeping consumption of saturated fat under 10 percent of calories per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>There is some evidence that long-term consumption of fish oil and n-3 fatty acids reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. One to two servings of oily fish in the weekly diet is suggested for most adult patients. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fish oil and marine omega-3 fatty acids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Consumption of trans fat, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol each affect plasma cholesterol levels. Elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations, particularly low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), show a strong and consistent association with the incidence of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, there are limited data showing that dietary interventions to lower cholesterol intake improve patient outcomes.

For most moderately active adults in the United States, that translates to approximately 25 g to 36 g per day.</p><p>Fiber is the portion of plants that cannot be digested by enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract. Fiber is available in a large variety of natural foods and supplements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82094\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82094 \">table 4</a>). Patients should be advised to replace refined grains (eg, white rice, white bread) with whole grains (eg, brown rice, whole-wheat bread), which have higher fiber content. (See <a href=\"#H2592966356\" class=\"local\">'Grains'</a> below.)</p><p>Increased fiber intake is associated with decreased risk in cardiovascular events, incidence of diabetes, and all-cause mortality:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular disease &ndash; High fiber intake is associated with a 40 to 50 percent reduction in the risk of CHD and stroke compared with low fiber intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>] and is associated with lower cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients who have had a myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A pooled analysis of cohort studies found that each 10 g increase in energy-adjusted intake of fiber per day was associated with a 14 percent relative reduction in the risk for all coronary events and a 27 percent reduction in CHD death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. High fiber diets may in part protect against CHD by controlling cardiovascular risk factors, including lowering insulin levels, improving lipid profiles, and lowering blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus &ndash; Fiber consumption from grains has a protective effect against diabetes mellitus.

However, the degree to which dietary fiber protects against the development of adenomas or colorectal cancer is uncertain, since the results of several epidemiologic studies and randomized trials are discordant. Dietary fiber and risk of colorectal and other cancers is discussed separately.

A 2014 meta-analysis of seven prospective cohort studies including over 900,000 patients found that high fiber intake was associated with decreased mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.74-0.80) with a dose-response relationship (each 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> increment associated with RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.85-0.92) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In the largest of the included studies, the European prospective cohort study, fiber intake was also inversely associated with mortality from circulatory, respiratory, digestive, and non-cardiovascular, noncancer inflammatory diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/healthy-diet-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Balancing caloric intake requires that many individuals decrease their typical calorie consumption while also engaging in physical activity. Calculating total energy expenditure for recommended daily caloric intake is based on age, sex, weight, and activity level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F107834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107834 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H355136369\" class=\"local\">'Caloric balance'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The benefits and risks of exercise&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caloric intake should be proportioned among the three macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Macronutrients are the chemical compounds consumed in the largest quantities and provide bulk energy. (See <a href=\"#H948339\" class=\"local\">'Macronutrients'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-fat\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary fat&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Micronutrients are nutrients required in small amounts and include several minerals and vitamins. (See <a href=\"#H948428\" class=\"local\">'Micronutrients'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin supplementation in disease prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salt intake, salt restriction, and primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The recommended dietary sodium intake for the general population is less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> (2.3 g of sodium or 6 g of sodium chloride). Low sodium intake is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular events, including death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most individuals who consume a balanced diet do not need to take vitamin supplements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main food groups generally consist of <span class=\"nowrap\">fruits/vegetables,</span> grains, dairy products, and protein-rich foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals should be counseled to consume five or more servings of fruits <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vegetables daily. Fruits and vegetables are a rich source of fiber, and <span class=\"nowrap\">fruit/vegetable</span> consumption is inversely associated with risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Fruits and vegetables'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals should be advised to replace refined grains (eg, white bread, white rice, refined and sweetened cereals) with whole grains (eg, whole-wheat bread, brown rice, whole-grain cereals or oatmeal), which have a higher content of fiber and other nutrients. Refined grains are associated with long-term weight gain. Whole grains are associated with a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, and premature mortality. (See <a href=\"#H2592966356\" class=\"local\">'Grains'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trans fatty acid consumption should be kept as low as possible by limiting foods such as partially hydrogenated oils, which are found in stick margarine and in many store-bought, processed, and fast foods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-fat#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary fat&quot;, section on 'Trans fatty acids'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals should be advised to avoid red and processed meats and counseled to eat a variety of healthy protein-rich foods, including seafood, lean meat such as poultry, eggs, beans, peas, soy products, and unsalted nuts and seeds. Consumption of red meats and processed meats is associated with increased mortality, while consumption of white meat is associated with decreased mortality. (See <a href=\"#H950468\" class=\"local\">'Protein'</a> above and <a href=\"#H950600\" class=\"local\">'Protein-rich foods'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The consumption of soft drinks and other sweetened beverages (eg, fruit drinks, sports drinks, and energy drinks) is a major source of added refined sugar and calories in the diet and should be discouraged. (See <a href=\"#H26714245\" class=\"local\">'Sweetened beverages'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-fat diet, vegetarian diets, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and the Mediterranean diet are among the most commonly used diets to maintain good health, where weight loss is not necessarily the primary goal. These diets are associated with health benefits. However, it is not known which type of diet is optimal for the general population. The decision to choose one of these diets is generally based on individual risk factors, personal preference, and the ability to adhere to a given diet. (See <a href=\"#H355136837\" class=\"local\">'Types of diet'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Willett WC.
