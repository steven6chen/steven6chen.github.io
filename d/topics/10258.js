When given intravenously, disopyramide causes a significant decline in cardiac contractility at doses as low as 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight (similar to that administered intravenously in humans).

HF usually occurs within the first three weeks of therapy; however, it can be seen as soon as 48 hours after the initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disopyramide</a> or as long as several months later. This complication is most likely to occur with preexisting heart failure, affecting 55 percent of such patients versus only 5 percent without a prior history of heart disease. Intravenous drug administration and concurrent renal failure are other risk factors for a significant decline in myocardial function. In one study, for example, intravenous disopyramide (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> lowered the cardiac index by 10 to 25 percent in patients with underlying heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-class-i-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

There may, however, be an acute requirement for therapy with diuretics, inotropic agents, or afterload reducing drugs. Prior treatment with these agents in patients at high risk also may be beneficial. Other suggestions to enhance the safety of disopyramide in patients with underlying myocardial dysfunction include avoidance of loading doses or intravenous administration, and careful dose titration.

Two factors contribute to this response: disopyramide slows the fibrillation or flutter rate, thereby making it more likely that a given impulse will pass through the AV node; and the direct anticholinergic effect of disopyramide enhances AV nodal conduction.

The most common adverse reactions involve the gastrointestinal, central nervous, and cardiovascular systems. Most of these complications are dose-dependent, particularly central nervous system side effects such as dizziness, nausea, unusual taste, and blurred vision, which are often ameliorated if the propafenone dose is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-class-i-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Potential side effects involving the cardiovascular system are most concerning, as the cardiac side effects are the most life-threatening. The risk of cardiovascular toxicity is greater in patients with structural heart disease and in those treated for ventricular rather than supraventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-class-i-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/109,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">109,110</a>].</p><p>The relation between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a> dose, concentration, clinical response, and toxicity is complex. The main metabolic route of propafenone is via the cytochrome P450 2D6 isoenzyme. This metabolic pathway, known to have genetic polymorphisms, is functionally absent in approximately 7 percent of whites and African Americans. In these &quot;slow metabolizers,&quot; the extent of first-pass hepatic metabolism is much less than in &quot;extensive metabolizers,&quot; and increased plasma concentration may be more likely to cause side effects. Moreover, because the oxidative elimination of propafenone is saturable, small dose increases may cause a rapid and disproportionate increase in plasma concentrations, thus augmenting its potential for causing toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16751133\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular effects</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16751140\"><span class=\"h3\">Inotropic effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a> and its metabolites can have negative inotropic effects on the myocardium. In patients with a normal or minimally decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (&ge;40 percent), oral propafenone can decrease the ejection fraction without causing symptoms of heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-class-i-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. However, overt heart failure may be induced in patients with preexisting ventricular systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-class-i-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. The negative inotropic effect of propafenone is associated with significant increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and a decline in cardiac output. Propafenone should therefore be <strong>avoided</strong> in patients with overt heart failure. However, propafenone can be administered cautiously to patients with mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction who have no clinical signs or symptoms of heart failure, with close monitoring over one to two weeks for the development of heart failure symptoms following the initiation of therapy.

Although the direct effect of blocking the beta-receptors is to impair contractility, the associated reduction in neurohumoral activation may lead to an improvement in cardiac function in patients with heart failure. Clinically significant beta-blocking activity is primarily seen at high doses in patients who are slow metabolizers of propafenone.

Alternatively, because potential variations in propafenone metabolism may exist and remain undetected in everyday practice, some authors have suggested a heart rate challenge, such as exercise testing, for patients using chronic propafenone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-class-i-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16751154\"><span class=\"h3\">Conduction disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propafenone</a> slows atrioventricular conduction and causes prolongation of the PR and QRS intervals. Prolongation of the PR interval ranges from 15 to 25 percent; it is a common finding and is not necessarily regarded as a sign of toxicity. However, on rare occasions propafenone has been associated with the development of atrioventricular block. Therefore, in the absence of a permanent pacemaker, patients on propafenone who develop second or third degree AV block should have their dose of propafenone reduced or discontinued. </p><p>Sodium channel blockade is probably responsible for QRS prolongation during exercise in patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>.

The risk of proarrhythmia appears greatest in those with underlying structural heart disease.
