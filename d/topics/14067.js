A major cause of cirrhosis-related morbidity and mortality is the development of variceal hemorrhage, a direct consequence of portal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Each episode of active variceal hemorrhage is associated with 30 percent mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In addition, survivors of an episode of active bleeding have a 70 percent risk of recurrent hemorrhage within one year of the bleeding episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Variceal hemorrhage occurs in 25 to 40 percent of patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. While several modalities are available for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, many are associated with significant adverse effects.</p><p>Accurate identification of patients at highest risk of bleeding permits stratification in an attempt to avoid potentially harmful preventive treatments in the 60 to 75 percent of patients who will never have variceal bleeding.</p><p>This topic will review the formation and progression of varices and the predictive factors and risk classification for variceal bleeding. Primary prophylaxis for variceal hemorrhage, the treatment of variceal hemorrhage, and the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis are discussed elsewhere.

Portal hypertension (defined as hydrostatic pressure &gt;5 mmHg) results initially from obstruction to portal venous outflow. Obstruction may occur at a presinusoidal (portal vein thrombosis, portal fibrosis, or infiltrative lesions), sinusoidal (cirrhosis), or postsinusoidal (veno-occlusive disease, Budd-Chiari syndrome) level. Cirrhosis is the most common cause of portal hypertension; in these patients, elevated portal pressure results from both increased resistance to outflow through distorted hepatic sinusoids, and enhanced portal inflow due to splanchnic arteriolar vasodilation.</p><p>Varices develop in order to decompress the hypertensive portal vein and return blood to the systemic circulation. They are seen when the pressure gradient between the portal and hepatic veins rises above 12 mmHg; patients with lower values do not form varices and do not bleed. The portal-hepatic venous pressure gradient is obtained by hepatic venous catheterization, with measurement of the difference between the wedged hepatic venous pressure (which approximates the sinusoidal and portal pressures in cirrhosis) and the free hepatic venous pressure. This procedure is routinely performed in many European centers, but less commonly in the United States. Although it does not predict the size of varices, it may be useful for monitoring the success of therapy aimed at lowering portal pressures, such as beta blockers. A systematic review of 12 studies found that a reduction of the hepatic vein pressure gradient to less than or equal to 12 mmHg was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of variceal bleeding and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>An illustrative study evaluated the relationship between the hepatic vein pressure gradient and the formation of and bleeding from varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Varices develop deep within the submucosa in the mid-esophagus, but become progressively more superficial in the distal esophagus. Thus, esophageal varices at the gastroesophageal junction have the thinnest layer of supporting tissue and are most likely to rupture and bleed.</p><p>Varices in the gastric fundus also bleed frequently. Gastric varices are often classified according to their location, which correlates with their risk of hemorrhage:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Varices in direct continuity with the esophagus along the lesser and greater curvatures of the stomach are called gastroesophageal varices (GOV) types 1 and 2, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated gastric varices in the fundus (IGV1) occur less frequently than GOVs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>The relationship between the site of the varices and the clinical risk of bleeding was illustrated in a prospective study of 568 consecutive patients with varices, 393 of whom were bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The mean transfusion requirement in patients with bleeding gastric varices was higher than in those with esophageal varices (4.8 versus 2.9 units per patient). Bleeding from isolated gastric varices in the fundus (IGV1) occurred much more frequently than either GOVs or isolated gastric varices at other loci in the stomach (IGV2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55976\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55976 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H129709551\"><span class=\"h2\">Size of varices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of variceal bleeding correlates independently with the diameter (size) of the varix.

As an example, while only one-third of all patients with cirrhosis experience variceal hemorrhage, more than 70 percent experience further episodes of variceal bleeding after an index bleed. These bleeding episodes may be considered as &quot;early&quot; or &quot;late&quot; with respect to their temporal relationship to the index bleed; one-third of patients with an index bleed will rebleed within six weeks, and one-third will rebleed after six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The risk of early rebleeding is greatest immediately after cessation of active hemorrhage (50 percent of such episodes occur within 48 hours) and subsides over time.</p><p>There is evidence that treatment of the underlying cause of the liver disease may reduce the severity of the portal hypertension and subsequent variceal hemorrhage. This is most often seen in patients who start alcohol abstinence and in those who have achieved a sustained virological response after hepatitis C therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/1,9,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H129709575\"><span class=\"h2\">Variceal pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variceal pressure may be measured accurately and relatively noninvasively with a pressure-sensitive endoscopic gauge, though this is not routinely done [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The variceal pressure may be an important predictor for variceal hemorrhage.

Variceal hemorrhage developed in 28 patients (32 percent). Variables predictive of a first bleed included: the level of variceal pressure; risk classification using the Child class, variceal size, and endoscopic appearance of the varices (see below); and the interval between diagnosis of varices and the start of the study. Specifically, the incidence of variceal bleeding with different levels of variceal pressure was as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&le;13 mmHg - <span class=\"nowrap\">0/25</span> (0 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&gt;13 and &le;14 mmHg - <span class=\"nowrap\">1/11</span> (9 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&gt;14 and &le;15 mmHg - <span class=\"nowrap\">2/12</span> (17 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&gt;15 and &le;16 mmHg - <span class=\"nowrap\">7/14</span> (50 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&gt;16 mmHg - <span class=\"nowrap\">18/25</span> (72 percent)</p><p/><p>Adding variceal pressure (categorized as &gt; or &le;15.2 mmHg) to the risk classification discussed below significantly improved the predictive value of this classification.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H129709583\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Child class (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>), variceal size, and presence of red wale markings can be used to calculate a prognostic index that numerically quantifies the risk of variceal hemorrhage in an individual patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65361\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65361 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

As an example, a patient with Child class C cirrhosis and tense ascites who has large varices with red signs has an approximately 76 percent likelihood of developing variceal hemorrhage within one year. Such a patient is clearly a candidate for prophylactic therapy to prevent bleeding.
