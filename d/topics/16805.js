They come in different forms, including pills, creams, and eye drops.</p><p>People commonly use OTC medicines to treat:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough and cold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin rashes or hives</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea or constipation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heartburn</p><p/><p>Some OTC medicines can cure the condition that is causing the symptoms. But many OTC medicines do not cure the condition that is causing the symptoms. Instead, they only improve symptoms for a short time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6761874\"><span class=\"h1\">Are OTC medicines safe to take during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some are probably safe, but others aren't. It depends on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medicine &ndash; Experts know that some medicines are probably safe to take during pregnancy. Experts also know that other medicines are not safe and could harm a baby or cause problems during pregnancy. But for many OTC medicines, experts don't know the answer. That's because studies have not been done to check the safety of most OTC medicines in pregnant women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How far along the pregnancy is &ndash; Most birth defects happen in the first few months of pregnancy. If you take an OTC medicine during that time, you can increase the chance that the medicine will harm your baby.</p><p/><p>The best way to know if an OTC medicine is safe to take during pregnancy is to ask your doctor or nurse. Call your doctor or nurse before you take any medicine during pregnancy.</p><p>You can also get information about the safety of taking certain medicines during pregnancy by calling the MotherToBaby hotline, which is free (in the US): 1-866-626-6847.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6761889\"><span class=\"h1\">Which pain-relieving medicine is best to take during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors usually recommend that pregnant women use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (brand name: Tylenol) to treat pain. Check with your doctor before taking any other pain medicines.</p><p>Doctors usually tell pregnant women to avoid taking medicines called &quot;NSAIDs,&quot; especially in the last 3 months of pregnancy. NSAIDs are a group of medicines that includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve). Taking a lot of NSAIDs in the last 3 months of pregnancy could harm your baby or cause problems during labor.</p><p>If your pain or headache doesn't get better after you take a dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a>, tell your doctor or nurse. It's especially important to let your doctor or nurse know about these symptoms in the last half of pregnancy. These could be symptoms of a serious problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6761904\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I take to treat constipation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To treat constipation, you can add more fiber to your diet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52349 \">table 1</a>). You can also use a fiber supplement.</p><p>If your constipation doesn't get better, ask your doctor or nurse about taking a medicine called a &quot;laxative.&quot; These medicines can help you have bowel movements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6761919\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I take herbal products?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ask your doctor or nurse before you take any herbal product or supplement. Some herbal products can harm an unborn baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6761934\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talk to your doctor or nurse at your routine pregnancy check-ups. Ask him or her which OTC medicines are safe to use. That way, if you have symptoms, you will know which medicines to use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask questions if you're not sure how to use a medicine. You can ask the pharmacy worker or your doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose a medicine that treats only the symptoms or condition you have.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throw out medicine that has expired. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6761949\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-before-and-during-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nutrition before and during pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=morning-sickness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Morning sickness (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-during-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) during pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prenatal care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-symptoms-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pregnancy symptoms (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
