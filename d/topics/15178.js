These types of fungal infections are also called &quot;tinea.&quot;</p><p>Some people call these fungal infections &quot;ringworm,&quot; because they often cause a ring-shaped, red, itchy rash on the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F116022\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116022 \">picture 1</a>). But a ring-shaped rash is not always there. People with athlete's foot might instead have moist, raw skin between their toes, or flaking skin on the bottoms of their feet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F116024\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116024 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F116027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116027 \">picture 3</a>). People with jock itch often just have a red rash on the groin.</p><p>Sometimes, especially in children, the fungus can infect the scalp. On the scalp, the infection can look like a bald spot or a round flaky patch of skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F116025\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116025 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481983489\"><span class=\"h1\">How did I get a fungal infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can catch fungal infections from anyone who is infected. You can also catch them from an infected dog or cat. Plus, you can pick up the infections from places where the fungus might be, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A shower stall</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The locker room floor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The area near a pool</p><p/><p>If you have a fungal infection on one part of your body, you can also spread it to other parts. For instance, men with a fungal infection on their feet sometimes spread it to their groin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481983496\"><span class=\"h1\">How are fungal infections treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment for a fungal infection depends on which body part is affected. If you have a fungal infection on your scalp, you must take pills that will kill the fungus. Treatment for scalp infections usually lasts 1 to 3 months.</p><p>If you have a fungal infection on your feet, groin, or another body part, you probably will not need pills. Instead, you can use a special gel, cream, lotion, or powder that kills fungus. Treatment with these products lasts 2 to 4 weeks.</p><p>If you have a fungal infection on your groin and on your feet, you must treat both infections at the same time. If you do not, the infection on your feet can spread to your groin again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481983503\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I keep from getting a fungal infection again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If someone in your home has had a fungal infection on their scalp:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get rid of any combs, brushes, barrettes, or other hair products that could have the fungus on them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure a doctor or nurse checks everyone in the house for a fungal infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the fungal infection might have come from a pet, have it checked by a vet</p><p/><p>Here are some other general tips on how to prevent fungal infections:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not share unwashed clothes, sports gear, or towels with other people</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always wear slippers or sandals when at the gym, pool, or other public areas. That includes public showers.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash with soap and shampoo after sports or exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change your socks and underwear at least once a day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your skin clean and dry. Always dry yourself well after swimming or showering.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481983510\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ringworm-including-athletes-foot-and-jock-itch-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ringworm (including athlete's foot and jock itch) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
