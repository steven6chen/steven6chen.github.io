Critical care ultrasonography (CCUS) is most commonly used in the emergency department and the intensive care unit. It can also be used in the operating room and postoperative care unit when evaluating patients who become acutely ill in the hospital. CCUS is commonly divided into four separate elements: thoracic (lung and pleural), abdominopelvic, vascular, and cardiac (basic and advanced). </p><p>This section will review the clinical utility of these four separate elements of CCUS. Details regarding bedside ultrasonography for trauma patients, thoracic ultrasonography in non-critically-ill patients, and transcranial ultrasonography in stroke patients are discussed separately.

Multiple terms are used to describe various elements of CCUS. These include terms that refer to the bedside application of ultrasonography (eg, point-of-care ultrasonography [POCUS]), and terms that refer to the organs imaged with ultrasonography including multiorgan ultrasonography, thoracic ultrasonography (TUS; lung, pleural, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heart), lung ultrasonography (LUS), abdominopelvic ultrasonography, vascular ultrasonography, and cardiac ultrasonography (basic and advanced critical care echocardiography [CCE]). </p><p>Protocols that describe the use of CCUS in critically-ill patients who present with shock or trauma have been described including rapid ultrasound in shock (RUSH), abdominal and cardiac evaluation with sonography in shock (ACES), focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST), and focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS). These protocols are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma#H30174425\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;, section on 'Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma'</a>.)</p><p>A widely accepted definition of the elements of CCUS that are required for competence has been published and constitutes a reasonable definition of the scope of practice of CCUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2507942025\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING CONSULTATIVE OR CRITICAL CARE ULTRASONOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For critical care ultrasonography (CCUS), the critical care clinician is directly responsible for all aspects of image acquisition and interpretation, and integration of the results into the management plan at the point of care. This differs from standard ultrasonography performed by the consultative radiology and cardiology services where there is a delay in these processes. The choice between using consultative ultrasonography or CCUS is dependent upon the available equipment, expertise, and the indication for the examination. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Consultative ultrasonography</strong> &ndash; In critically-ill patients, consultative radiology- or cardiology-performed ultrasonography is typically done at the bedside or in a radiology suite using large expensive machines; it is usually performed by skilled technicians and later interpreted by radiologists or cardiologists with ultrasonography expertise. Thus, consultative ultrasonography assessment is useful for hemodynamically stable patients with complex disorders that require high level of expertise at image acquisition and interpretation (eg, detailed assessment of the hepatobiliary system, <span class=\"nowrap\">obstetric/gynecologic</span> applications, testicular disease, detailed assessment of valvular heart disease). Another major indication for consultative ultrasonography is when the critical care clinician identifies an abnormality beyond their level of expertise to assess (eg, splenic lesions, complex renal or hepatic cysts). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Critical care ultrasonography</strong> &ndash; CCUS uses portable equipment that is compact and relatively inexpensive. Image acquisition and interpretation are performed by the intensivist at the bedside, so the imaging results can be immediately actionable and integrated into a comprehensive management plan. CCUS is typically best suited for patients with imminently life threatening processes, to categorize shock and respiratory failure, to check for coexisting diagnoses and complications of therapy, and to track the evolution of the critical illness by serial examinations. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although useful as a standalone bedside tool, CCUS should not eliminate the need for standard imaging tools, particularly when CCUS is not helpful or when confirmation of a diagnosis is important or complex (eg, mitral valve rupture, complicated pneumothorax). When appropriately used, CCUS can reduce the use of other imaging modalities such as chest CT, chest radiography, and even pulmonary artery catheter use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H277663917\"><span class=\"h1\">THORACIC ULTRASONOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thoracic ultrasonography (TUS; lung and pleural), is a key component of critical care ultrasonography (CCUS) and for the purposes of this topic does not include cardiac ultrasonography. In critically-ill patients, TUS can be used to evaluate patients with acute cardiopulmonary respiratory failure, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax, the details of which are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H277663958\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of the etiology of cardiopulmonary failure'</a> below and <a href=\"#H106906910\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and treatment of pleural effusion'</a> below and <a href=\"#H277663971\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for pneumothorax'</a> below and <a href=\"#H106906895\" class=\"local\">'Investigational'</a> below.)</p><p>An algorithmic approach to evaluation of acute respiratory failure that recommends examination of three well defined points on the thorax (anterior, lateral, and posterolateral) bilaterally (the BLUE protocol) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Based upon the ultrasonography findings derived from these examination points, the etiology of the respiratory failure may be identified in a high proportion of cases. This algorithm is distinguished by its simplicity and ease of use but other protocols exist with no study demonstrating superiority of one over the other.</p><p>Additional techniques used to obtain lung and pleural ultrasonography images, the advantages and disadvantages of TUS compared with traditional radiographic imaging of the lung (chest radiography and computed tomography [CT]), and the value of emergency ultrasonography in adults with thoracic trauma, a probes used for imaging are discussed separately.

Bladder masses may appear as irregular, echogenic projections from the bladder wall or as localized bladder wall thickening. Although the bladder wall thickness varies with the degree of filling, the wall thickness is normally between 3 to 6 mm. In addition to malignancy, the differential of bladder masses includes diverticula, bladder wall thickening due to chronic cystitis, foreign bodies, stones, and blood clots.

The right and left upper quadrant is scanned with attention to the hepatorenal and splenorenal recess, as well as the right and left paracolic gutters, and the rectouterine (pouch of Douglas) and rectovesicular pouch. Non-complicated collections of fluid often appear as an anechoic collection. With complexity, fluid collections may appear as a complex non-septated collection, a homogenous complex collection, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a septated collection. The presence of blood may give the appearance of an ultrasound &quot;hematocrit sign&quot; (an anechoic layer interfaced with an increased echogenic dependent layer due the gravitational effects on blood). Details regarding the role of FAST and ultrasonographic appearance of fluid in patients with trauma are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma#H30174508\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;, section on 'Intraperitoneal free fluid'</a>.) </p><p>Commonly, free fluid from ascites due to a medical cause such as cirrhosis may also be detected by CCUS and, if indicated, may guide paracentesis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5956547\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection of abdominal free air</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not a well-established modality for imaging abdominal free air, several studies have reported that abdominal free air can be identified using ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. For the sonographic examination for abdominal free air, high frequency linear probes and curved array transducers (2.6 to 5 MHz range), are preferred to better visualize the peritoneal layer and associated free air. The patient should be positioned at an incline of 10 to 20 degrees or placed in the semi-left lateral decubitus position to maximize the detection of air. </p><p>Ultrasonography can be used to detect the following types of abdominal free air:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pneumoperitoneum</strong> &ndash; The identification of free intraperitoneal air is found most consistently over the ventral aspect of the liver when the patient is supine or in a semi-left lateral decubitus position (also known as the enhanced peritoneal stripe sign [EPSS]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. EPSS consists of a superficial single or double echogenic line that denotes the interface of the abdominal wall with the peritoneal surface. With more free air, multiple layers of air bubbles create reverberation artifacts referred to as &quot;Comet tails&quot; and &quot;ring-downs.&quot; Another reverberation artifact seen in pneumoperitoneum is called A-lines. When echogenic lines run parallel to the peritoneal stripe, this is termed &quot;A-lines.&quot; The identification of abdominal organs, such as liver and bowel structures, rules out pneumoperitoneum at the site of the probe position, as air blocks transmission of ultrasonography. The detection of pneumoperitoneum has a reported sensitivity and specificity ranging from 85 to 100 percent and 99 to 100 percent respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/57-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-65</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pneumoretroperitoneum</strong> &ndash; This is a rare complication of trauma, cancer, infection, or invasive procedures. The typical ultrasonography findings include air around the right kidney creating a &quot;veiling&quot; appearance, air ventral to the aorta and inferior vena cava creating the appearance of a vanishing vessel, and air collections around the retroperitoneal duodenum, pancreatic head, and posterior to the gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-69</a>]. In contrast to free intraperitoneal air, shifting of gas does not occur with positional changes in the patient. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intraluminal free air</strong> &ndash; Air within lumens of non-bowel structures can be observed within the biliary system, gallbladder, bladder, vascular structures, and pancreatic ducts. The interpretation of these findings depends upon the clinical context, with iatrogenic manipulation, trauma, and infection being the typical causes. Air in the portal venous system is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is often the result of bowel necrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intraparenchymal free air</strong> &ndash; Intraparenchymal free air refers to the identification of gas within an organ (eg, liver, kidney). This most commonly occurs in the setting of infection with abscess formation but can also be due to trauma and neoplasms. The identification of emphysematous pyelonephritis can be made with ultrasonography, and when found, emergency nephrectomy is often indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H277663931\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR ULTRASONOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vascular system is an essential area of critical care ultrasonography (CCUS) application.

Ultrasonography identifies thrombus as non-compressibility of the imaged vein. The value of compression ultrasonography in the diagnosis of upper and lower extremity DVT is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-deep-vein-thrombosis-of-the-lower-extremity#H1036971809\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic ultrasonography suspected first DVT'</a>.)</p><p>A high frequency (5 to 10 MHz) linear transducer is used for the assessment of DVT. Compression ultrasonography is performed in a transverse orientation since error can be introduced when the transducer is oriented in a longitudinal axis. A firm, rapid compression with the probe should be used with minimal to no distortion to the corresponding artery. Compressible veins are considered patent and without thrombus, while non-compressible veins are diagnostic of thrombus. If a thrombus is visible within the vein, the compression component of the examination is not required and may be rarely associated with dislodgement of the thrombus. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lower extremity</strong> &ndash; For the lower extremity, the patient should be in the supine position in order to image the femoral veins. As the critically-ill patient cannot usually assume a prone position, the popliteal vein is examined by flexing the knee with outward rotation of the hip and placement of the linear probe in the popliteal fossa. A compression exam with the ultrasound probe begins in the groin at the proximal common femoral vein. Compressibility of the vein is assessed at the following five sites: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The proximal common femoral artery and vein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The junction of the saphenous vein and the common femoral vein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The bifurcation of the common femoral artery and deep femoral artery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The bifurcation of the common femoral vein into the superficial and deep femoral vein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The popliteal vein </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some examiners extend the examination to include the superficial femoral vein. Whether this increases the yield compared to the standard five point examination is debatable. Extending the examination adds very little time to the test. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a retrospective chart review, multiorgan ultrasonography (thoracic, cardiac, lung, abdominal, vascular) reduced the number of radiology-service-performed DVT studies per patient (0.02 versus 0.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In another study, bedside ultrasonography had a sensitivity and specificity of 86 and 93 percent, respectively, compared with standard compression ultrasonography; in addition standard compression ultrasonography was associated with a 14 hour time delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upper extremity</strong> &ndash; For the upper extremity, the patient should be supine with the arm externally rotated and abducted 90 degrees from the chest. The patient's head is rotated to the contralateral side and elevated above the extremity to avoid external compression of the distal subclavian vein between the first rib and clavicle. The target vein is imaged in a transverse plane in multiple sites with a similar compression technique to that described for the lower extremity. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5957063\"><span class=\"h2\">Central venous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of ultrasonography guidance is commonplace for placement of central venous catheters.

In hemodynamically unstable patients, ultrasound is the imaging modality of first choice for the diagnosis of a ruptured AAA. Expected findings include an enlarged aorta with or without a fluid collection in the abdomen. In the emergency department, several studies report high sensitivity (97.5 to 100 percent) and specificity (94.1 to 100 percent) for AAA detection using bedside ultrasonography compared with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/71-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-74</a>].

One standard definition of competence is available that is supplemented by an expert consensus statement on training in CCUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/1,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37</a>]. One study reported that a three-day course resulted in improved CCUS skills but further studies are needed to determine whether such courses will translate into effective clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. </p><p>Non-cardiologists can achieve competence in basic critical care echocardiography (CCE) with appropriate training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/89-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-102</a>]. The use of basic CCE is supported by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, American Society of Echocardiography, and an international committee on focused cardiac ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/1,37,79,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37,79,103</a>]. Although requirements for training in basic CCE have not been standardized, a typical training sequence includes a didactic component for mastery of the cognitive base of CCE, hands-on training initially with normal human subjects followed by scanning of patients under the supervision of a capable instructor, and review of a comprehensive image set representative of a wide range of normal and abnormal findings. As a guide, one report indicates that a 12-hour learning program blending didactics, interactive clinical cases, and tutored hands-on sessions is a sufficient training period for basic CCE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-bedside-ultrasonography-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13030392\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Critical care ultrasonography (CCUS) refers to the use of ultrasonography in patients who are critically-ill. Compared with consultative ultrasonography, CCUS is a bedside tool that can be rapidly performed and interpreted simultaneously by the operator, usually an intensivist or emergency department physician, prompting a diagnosis, a procedure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a therapy. The most common four elements of CCUS are thoracic, abdominal, vascular, and cardiac. (See <a href=\"#H13030268\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1756780179\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choosing consultative radiology- or cardiology -performed ultrasonography or CCUS is dependent upon available equipment and skill as well as the indication. While consultative ultrasonography assessment is useful for hemodynamically stable patients with complex disorders that require skilled expertise, CCUS is typically best suited for patients with imminently life threatening processes, in whom the result will determine the administration of a specific or life-saving therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2507942025\" class=\"local\">'Choosing consultative or critical care ultrasonography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic ultrasonography (TUS) includes ultrasonography of both the lung and the pleural space. In the critically-ill patient, TUS can be used to evaluate patients with acute cardiopulmonary respiratory failure, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax. (See <a href=\"#H277663917\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic ultrasonography'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thoracic-ultrasound-indications-advantages-and-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thoracic ultrasound: Indications, advantages, and technique&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominopelvic CCUS is useful for the evaluation of a possible source of sepsis and acute undifferentiated abdominal pain. This includes patients suspected as having gallstones or acute cholecystitis, urinary tract obstruction, free fluid suggestive of vessel rupture or abscess, or free air suggestive of a ruptured viscus or gas-producing organism. Emergency abdominopelvic ultrasonography is useful in the evaluation of patients suspected as having contusion or bleeding from abdominal trauma. (See <a href=\"#H277663924\" class=\"local\">'Abdominopelvic ultrasonography'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma#H30174499\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;, section on 'Abdominal examination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular CCUS includes the evaluation of upper and lower extremities for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), imaging of central and peripheral veins and arteries for catheter placement, and evaluation of the aorta for rupture or dissection. (See <a href=\"#H277663931\" class=\"local\">'Vascular ultrasonography'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H15828721\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-deep-vein-thrombosis-of-the-lower-extremity#H1036971809\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic ultrasonography suspected first DVT'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Critical care echocardiography (CCE) can be classified as basic or advanced. Basic CCE, which is discussed in this topic, is useful in the evaluation of patients with undifferentiated shock or acute cardiopulmonary failure; occasionally it can be used to identify potentially reversible etiologies of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. (See <a href=\"#H277663938\" class=\"local\">'Basic critical care echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquiring the necessary skills for performing CCUS depends upon an understanding of normal and abnormal ultrasonography anatomy to avoid image misinterpretation as well as a knowledge of the indications and limitations of CCUS.
