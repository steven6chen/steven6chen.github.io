Specifically, the time until the first rapid eye movement (REM) period (ie, REM latency) shortens, the percentage of time spent in REM sleep decreases modestly, and slow wave sleep decreases from around 20 percent in the normal young adult to less than 10 percent in a 70-year-old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stages-and-architecture-of-normal-sleep\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stages and architecture of normal sleep&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The overall effect of these changes is that older adults tend to complain of difficulty maintaining sleep, more so than difficulty initiating sleep. As the time spent asleep at night decreases, there is increased daytime sleepiness, difficulty maintaining wakefulness, and a propensity for napping. However, daytime sleepiness should not be considered normal in the healthy elderly. Patients whose complaints are mild do not require any diagnostic testing or treatment. However, if the complaints seem out of proportion to normal aging (ie, are affecting basic activities of daily living or cognitive functioning) or there are other symptoms or signs of a primary sleep disorder, diagnostic testing is warranted to look for coexisting sleep disorders that require treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5201840\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER CAUSES OF SLEEP IMPAIRMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are numerous causes of impaired sleep in older adults, other than normal aging.</p><p>Lifestyle changes that accompany retirement, illness, or debilitation frequently contribute to poor habits that impair sleep (ie, poor sleep hygiene) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Examples include spending long periods of time in bed, having an irregular sleep schedule, trying to force sleep, drinking caffeinated beverages or alcohol near bedtime (eg, late afternoon and evening), smoking or other nicotine intake particularly during the evening, stimuli in the bedroom environment (eg, ambient light, television, or radio), persistent concerns or worries at bedtime, lack of exercise, and frequent daytime naps (especially those that are longer than 20 to 30 minutes or occur late in the day). </p><p>Many medical and psychiatric illnesses that are common in older adults are associated with poor sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Examples include cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, arthritis, dementia, depression, anxiety, and prostatic hypertrophy. Any condition associated with chronic pain is likely to disturb sleep and provoke nocturnal awakenings. Anemia and chronic renal failure are risk factors for restless legs syndrome and periodic leg movements of sleep, resulting in poor sleep maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

This is particularly true of sleep apnea, which is the focus of the remainder of this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SLEEP APNEA IN OLDER ADULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep apnea is a disorder characterized by apneas and hypopneas during sleep. It collectively describes both obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, in which apneas and hypopneas are due to repetitive collapse of the upper airway) and central sleep apnea (CSA, in which apneas and hypopneas occur in the absence of upper airway collapse). OSA is more common than CSA in all age groups. Herein, we use the term, sleep apnea, when describing OSA and CSA collectively or when describing studies that did not distinguish the type of sleep apnea. Otherwise, we refer to OSA or CSA specifically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has been suggested that sleep apnea in older adults may be a different disorder than sleep apnea in younger adults, with a distinct phenotype in older adults. One study suggested that airway collapsibility worsens with aging, but this may be mitigated by reduced ventilatory drive and demand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Nonetheless, most of the evidence indicates that sleep apnea manifests the same way in older and younger adults. This was illustrated by an observational study of 389 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with sleep apnea; patients &ge;65 years old did not differ in terms of their disease severity, their polysomnographic data, or the therapeutic implications of their diagnostic study when compared with patients &lt;65 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2139733\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of sleep apnea appears to increase among older individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>] and less healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is good evidence that the frequency of respiratory events during sleep increases with age. In the Sleep Heart Health Study, which surveyed the general population, the prevalence of sleep apnea was 1.7-fold higher in older adults (&gt;60 years) compared with 40- to 60-year-old adults, using an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) cutoff of &ge;15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The prevalence of sleep apnea was 10 percent among independently living older adults, 21 percent among medical ward patients, and 26 percent among nursing home patients. This was a study of patients referred to a sleep center for evaluation; therefore, the applicability of these results to the general population is uncertain. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2610233\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Untreated severe sleep apnea has been associated with mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>] and multiple morbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>] in adult populations that are heterogeneous with respect to age. These associations have not been as well studied in older adults and, often, the best evidence related to older adults is from the subgroup analyses of studies that included adults of all ages. This section focuses on the natural history of untreated sleep apnea specifically in older patients. The natural history of untreated sleep apnea in adults of all ages is described elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Complications and adverse outcomes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mortality</strong> &ndash; Untreated severe sleep apnea has not been associated with increased mortality in older patients, even though the association has been demonstrated in studies that evaluated adults of all ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. As an example, a prospective cohort study followed 6441 adults for an average of eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Among all adults, untreated severe sleep apnea (defined as an AHI &gt;30 events per hour of sleep) was associated with increased mortality compared with no sleep apnea (defined as an AHI &lt;5 events per hour of sleep). However, in the subgroup of 110 adults who were &gt;70 years old, untreated severe sleep apnea was not associated with increased mortality compared with no sleep apnea (relative risk 1.27, 95% CI 0.86-1.86 among men; relative risk 1.14, 95% CI 0.65-2.01 among women) although there were too few events in the subgroup to definitively exclude or confirm a mortality effect. In a Danish study of more than 25,000 patients with sleep apnea, survival with CPAP treatment was increased in males &ge;60 years of age, but not in females &ge;60 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stroke</strong> &ndash; Untreated severe sleep apnea has been associated with risk for an ischemic stroke in older adults. In a prospective cohort study of 400 adults aged 70 to 100 years who were followed for six years, an ischemic stroke occurred in 20 patients (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Patients with untreated severe sleep apnea (defined as AHI &ge;30 events per hour of sleep) had an increased risk of developing an ischemic stroke (adjusted hazard ratio 2.52, 95% CI 1.04-6.01) compared with those who did not have sleep apnea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sleep apnea is highly prevalent in patients with stroke. American Heart Association and American Stroke Association guidelines call screening patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) for sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Unattended (&ldquo;home&rdquo;) sleep studies may be useful; this approach resulted in valid studies in 97.1 percent of subjects in one study, with a prevalence of sleep apnea of 61.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive abnormalities</strong> &ndash; The potential relationship between sleep apnea and cognitive defects is important because both sleep apnea and dementia are highly prevalent among older adults. Numerous observational studies have found an association between sleep apnea and cognitive defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/23,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,32-34</a>]. In one study, 298 women (mean age of 82 years) underwent polysomnography and then were followed prospectively for four years for the development of neurocognitive defects, as determined by cognitive testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Women with sleep apnea (defined as AHI &ge;15 events per hour of sleep) were more likely to develop mild cognitive defects or dementia than women without sleep apnea (45 versus 31 percent, adjusted odds ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1.11-3.08). A more recent study of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease showed that those with sleep disordered breathing had an earlier age of onset of MCI and that CPAP may delay the progression of cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypertension</strong> &ndash; Untreated sleep apnea characterized by an oxyhemoglobin saturation &lt;90 percent for &ge;12 percent of the sleep time (and not by the AHI) was more closely associated with the prevalence of systemic hypertension in patients &gt;65 years old (adjusted odds ratio 1.44, 95% CI 1.03-2.00) than patients &lt;65 years old (adjusted odds ratio 1.26, 95% CI 0.89-1.78) in a cross-sectional study of 6132 adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, studies that have used the AHI alone to compare older adults with untreated severe sleep apnea to older adults without sleep apnea, have found that the strength of the association between sleep apnea and systemic hypertension diminishes with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coronary artery disease</strong> &ndash; Untreated severe sleep apnea (defined as AHI &ge;30 events per hour of sleep) was associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (defined as myocardial infarction, revascularization procedure, or death due to coronary artery disease) in men 40 to 70 years old (adjusted hazard ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.02-2.76), but not in older men or in women of any age in a prospective cohort study that followed 4422 adults for a median of almost nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Other studies have been unable to confirm this association because there were too few events to allow stratification by age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heart failure</strong> &ndash; It is unclear whether untreated severe sleep apnea (defined as AHI &ge;30 events per hour of sleep) may also be associated with the development of heart failure in older patients with heart failure. In the prospective cohort study of 4422 adults described above, both men older and younger than 70 years with severe untreated sleep apnea exhibited a trend toward more incident heart failure than men of the same age who did not have sleep apnea (adjusted hazard ratio 1.58, 95% CI 0.93-2.66) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2139794\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of sleep apnea is the same in older adults and younger adults. In patients with OSA, apneas and hypopneas are consequences of repetitive upper airway collapse, while in patients with CSA, apneas and hypopneas are consequences of either hyperventilation or hypoventilation.

Excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue is the most common finding, but patients may also exhibit poor concentration, inattention, morning headaches, or restless sleep. Patients with OSA generally snore loudly and frequently awake with a sensation of choking, gasping, or smothering. Cognitive deficits and nocturia may be more frequent presentations of sleep apnea in older adults, and both may be reversible with treatment of sleep apnea. The symptoms and signs of sleep apnea are described in greater detail, separately.

This includes the indications for treatment, behavior modification, selection of the sleep apnea-specific therapy (ie, positive airway pressure, oral appliance, surgery), and follow-up. This section describes the few differences that exist when managing an older adult with sleep apnea. The management of sleep apnea is described in more detail separately.

In a multicenter trial that included 278 adults &ge;65 years of age with newly diagnosed OSA, patients randomized to receive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy plus best supportive care had improved daytime sleepiness compared with those assigned to best supportive care alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The benefits of CPAP were present at both 3- and 12-month time points and were greater in those with higher CPAP usage and higher baseline Epworth sleepiness scale scores. Additional secondary endpoints, including quality of life, mobility, cognitive function, and cardiovascular events, were similar between groups. Although the self-reported CPAP adherence rate was relatively high (86 percent at 3 months and 71 percent at 12 months), the median nightly CPAP usage was only two hours, which might have limited efficacy. Other important limitations of the trial include the lack of a sham CPAP control, allowing for a placebo effect, and the fact that trial entry was based on overnight oximetry parameters rather than polysomnography.</p><p>As in young adults, this trial highlights the importance of follow-up and early troubleshooting of side effects in older adults, which may help to improve adherence and thereby maximize the benefits of CPAP therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adherence with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&quot;, section on 'Interventions'</a>.)</p><p>Avoiding all sedatives (including alcohol) is a particularly important aspect of managing sleep apnea in older adults. Sedatives decrease the respiratory drive, worsen upper airway dysfunction during sleep, and have been shown to dramatically worsen the severity of sleep apnea. Older adults tend to be more sensitive to these effects due to age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5201400\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-related complaints are common among older adults (ie, adults &gt;65 years old). It is often difficult to distinguish whether the impaired sleep that leads to such complaints is a consequence of normal aging or a disease process, such as a primary sleep disorder or a medical illness. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-related changes that are a normal consequence of aging include phase advance (ie, sleep during the early morning hours is reduced and peak sleepiness occurs earlier in the evening), decreased sleep efficiency, diminished total sleep time, and reduced daytime sleep latency. The overall effect of these changes is that older adults tend to complain of difficulty maintaining sleep. As the time spent asleep at night decreases, there is increased daytime sleepiness and napping. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'The effects of normal aging on sleep'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, causes of impaired sleep that are unrelated to normal aging include lifestyle changes (ie, poor sleep hygiene), medical illnesses, primary sleep disorders, and psychiatric illnesses. (See <a href=\"#H5201840\" class=\"local\">'Other causes of sleep impairment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary sleep disorders tend to be more common among older adults than younger adults. This is particularly true of sleep apnea, a disorder characterized by apneas and hypopneas during sleep. The prevalence of sleep apnea in older adults is substantial and appears to increase among older individuals and less healthy individuals. (See <a href=\"#H2139733\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep apnea has been associated with stroke, mild cognitive defects, and dementia in older adults. It also appears to be associated with systemic hypertension if accompanied by significant hypoxemia. Sleep apnea has not been associated with mortality in older adults, as studies have had too few events to either exclude or confirm a mortality effect. (See <a href=\"#H2610233\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of sleep apnea are essentially the same in older and younger adults. (See <a href=\"#H2139794\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2139764\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2139824\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ayalon L, Liu L, Ancoli-Israel S.
