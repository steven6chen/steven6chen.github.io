However, rash in the diaper area is a common manifestation of mucocutaneous candidiasis in the premature infant. In one review, 8 percent of very low birth weight infants (birth weight below 1500 g) developed mucocutaneous candidiasis during their initial NICU admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This study also demonstrated that premature infants with candidal diaper dermatitis who had a change in their clinical status were at increased risk for developing systemic infection. Infants with candidal diaper dermatitis are also more likely to have <em>Candida</em> colonization of their gastrointestinal tract.</p><p><em>Candida </em>diaper dermatitis is characterized by an area of confluent erythema in the inguinal region, discrete erythematous papules and plaques with superficial scales, and satellite lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59361%7EPEDS%2F72165\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59361 graphicRef72165 \">picture 2A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive fungal dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive fungal dermatitis is a unique condition described in extremely low birth weight premature infants (birth weight below 1000 g) during the first two weeks of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>]. The lesions vary in appearance. They include macular, papular, vesicular, or pustular lesions that are typically in dependent or intertriginous areas of the skin. The erosions can be extensive and sometimes involve the whole area of the abdomen or back.</p><p>Skin biopsy is diagnostic and shows <em>Candida</em> hyphae invading the dermis. Dissemination of infection to the bloodstream is common.</p><p>In a case series of 16 infants with this condition, postnatal steroids and hyperglycemia were implicated as risk factors; 69 percent had evidence of disseminated fungal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital candidiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital cutaneous candidiasis is a rare disorder that results from a candidal infection acquired in utero or during delivery. The risk of ascending infection is increased by ruptured membranes, presence of a uterine or cervical foreign body, and a history of vaginal candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>The affected infant typically presents on the first day of life with a generalized eruption of 2 to 4 mm erythematous macules <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> papules that rest upon a 5 to 10 mm erythematous base.

Unlike erythema toxicum neonatorum or miliaria, this condition is characterized by the frequent involvement of the palms and soles. Oral thrush may be present at birth, and yellow-white papules may be observed on the umbilical cord.</p><p>In term infants, the skin lesions generally resolve with desquamation by the first week of life. Since the disease in these infants is usually limited to the skin, it can be treated successfully with topical antifungal agents and close surveillance. Occasionally, term babies with congenital candidiasis have systemic manifestations, such as pneumonia or clinical evidence of sepsis, which require systemic antifungal therapy.</p><p>In preterm infants, the rash may have a variable presentation including widespread pustular and vesicular lesions, or diffuse erythematous macular patches resembling a burn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Crusting of the skin may be the presenting feature of such cases. Cultures for fungus should be obtained of blood, urine, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Demonstration of budding yeast and pseudohyphae, usually in large numbers, on a potassium hydroxide preparation of scrapings from the skin lesions is helpful in making the diagnosis. Skin biopsy may be needed in some cases. Premature infants with congenital candidiasis have a greater risk for systemic infection and should be treated for candidemia until culture results are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature infants, particularly extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (birth weight less than 1000 g), are at increased risk for developing candidemia because of the immaturity of their immune and host epithelial protection, compromise of their epithelial protection with invasive procedures (eg, intubation, central venous catheters, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery), and factors that promote increased density of candidal colonization (eg, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics).

As the gestational age decreased, the risk of candidemia increased. Thus, ELBW infants had the highest risk of candidemia, with an incidence of 2.68 per 1000 patient days.

The most common presentation is similar to that of bacterial sepsis. Symptoms include lethargy, feeding intolerance, hyperbilirubinemia, apnea, cardiovascular instability, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22</a>]. In the most severe cases, cardiorespiratory function is severely compromised with multiorgan failure. The combination of persistent hyperglycemia and thrombocytopenia is strongly associated with candidemia, and so if these are present, a diagnosis of candidemia should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The hallmark of candidemia is the involvement of multiple organ systems, especially in low birth weight infants. Infants with multiorgan failure have a poor prognosis. The diagnosis of a candidal infection of any one organ system should prompt a thorough examination and evaluation to detect candidemia and other organ involvement. Although any organ can be involved, the most common sites include the eye, urinary tract, heart, and central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/22,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24,25</a>].

It is unclear whether the perforation is due to a primary candidal invasion of the mucosa or whether <em>Candida </em>is only a colonizing organism that invades the bowel wall that was already damaged from a primary insult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

However, &quot;<em>Candida </em>endophthalmitis&quot; is the more commonly used term in the ophthalmology literature and, therefore, is also used in this discussion.</p><p>In the neonate, endophthalmitis results from the hematogenous spread of <em>Candida </em>to the eye. The reported incidence varies from 6 to 50 percent of premature infants with disseminated candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/24,41,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,41,48</a>]. In the largest case series that included 86 infants with candidemia, 4 of the 67 infants (6 percent) in whom indirect ophthalmoscopy examination was performed had retinal abnormalities indicative of candidal infections.</p><p>Indirect ophthalmoscopy examination must be performed to make the diagnosis of candidal chorioretinitis in all infants with suspected or proven candidemia, because affected neonates may not present with any clinical signs or symptoms and, if not treated, endophthalmitis may lead to limitation in vision. The classic ophthalmologic findings are focal, glistening, white, infiltrative, often mound-like lesions on the retina with indistinct borders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58685\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58685 \">picture 4</a>).

Infants with fungemia that lasted five or more days were more likely to have cardiac lesions, as well as renal or ophthalmologic abnormalities.

Because the sensitivity of a single blood culture is low in detecting disseminated candidiasis, multiple or repeat blood cultures should be performed to increase the likelihood of detecting candidemia.

It includes oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush), diaper dermatitis, congenital candidiasis, and invasive fungal dermatitis. Mucocutaneous candidiasis has the potential to disseminate via the blood stream to other organs, especially in premature infants with either congenital candidiasis or invasive fungal dermatitis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mucocutaneous candidiasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic infection is disseminated infection through the bloodstream that results in multiorgan infection. Premature infants, particularly extremely low birth weight infants (birth weight less than 1000 g) are at increased risk for developing candidemia. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Systemic infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catheter-related infection is a major cause of disseminated systemic infection. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Catheter-related infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive focal infection is generally due to seeding of the individual organ system from hematogenous dissemination. Although any organ can be involved, the most common infected sites include the eye, urinary tract, heart, and central nervous system. In infants with a sterile body fluid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urine culture positive for <em>Candida</em>, further evaluation is recommended to detect disseminated invasive focal infection.
